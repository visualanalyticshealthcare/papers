In this retrospective study, 52 patients underwent cervical spine MRI using ZTE, ZTE-DL, and T2-weighted 3D sequences on a 1.5-Tesla scanner. ZTE-DL sequences were reconstructed from raw data using the AirReconDL algorithm. Three blinded readers independently evaluated image quality, artifacts, and bone delineation on a 5-point Likert scale. Cervical structures and pathologies, including soft tissue and bone components in spinal canal and neural foraminal stenosis, were analyzed. Image quality was quantitatively assessed by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Mean image quality scores were 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 for ZTE and 3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 for ZTE-DL, with ZTE-DL exhibiting fewer artifacts and superior bone delineation. Significant differences were observed between T2-weighted and ZTE-DL sequences for evaluating intervertebral space, anterior osteophytes, spinal canal, and neural foraminal stenosis (p\u2009<\u20090.05), with ZTE-DL providing more accurate assessments. ZTE-DL also showed improved evaluation of the osseous components of neural foraminal stenosis compared to ZTE (p\u2009<\u20090.05). ZTE-DL sequences offer superior image quality and bone visualization compared to ZTE sequences and enhance standard cervical spine MRI in assessing bone involvement in spinal canal and neural foraminal stenosis. Deep learning-based reconstructions improve zero-echo-time sequences in cervical spine MRI by enhancing image quality and bone visualization. This advancement offers additional insights for assessing bone involvement in spinal canal and neural foraminal stenosis, advancing clinical radiology practice. Conventional MRI encounters challenges with osseous structures due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Zero-echo-time (ZET) sequences offer CT-like images of the C-spine but with lower quality. Deep learning reconstructions improve image quality of zero-echo-time sequences. ZTE sequences with deep learning reconstructions refine cervical spine osseous pathology assessment.

It is also toxic to aquatic and human life and has the potential for long-term environmental contamination. This study aims to alleviate the adverse environmental effects of anthracene through fungal degradation, focusing on bioremediation approaches using bioinformatics. Toxicity prediction using Pro-Tox 3.0 identified anthracene as a compound of toxicity class 4 with a LD50 of 316\u00a0mg/kg. Sequence of manganese peroxidase from Lachnellula suecica and human adrenergic receptor beta 2 were retrieved from NCBI databases. Secondary structure analysis using SOPMA indicated that both manganese peroxidase and adrenergic receptor beta 2 contain significant random coil content (56.57% and 51.57% respectively) followed by alpha-helix and beta-turns. The tertiary structure of both proteins was predicted using the SWISSMODEL tool and molecular docking using Autodock vina revealed strong binding affinities of anthracene with adrenergic receptor beta 2, showing a binding energy of -\u20096.6\u00a0kcal/mol with anthracene confirming the negative impacts on human health. To mitigate the anthracene pollution, further docking indicated Anthracene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid as the most vigorous ligand for manganese peroxidase of L. suecica with a binding energy of -\u20099.3\u00a0kcal/mol, suggesting its potential as a bioremediating agent.

", "abstract": "A medical specialty prediction system for remote diagnosis can reduce the unexpected costs incurred by first-visit patients who visit the wrong hospital department for their symptoms. To develop medical specialty prediction systems, several researchers have explored clinical predictive models using real medical text data. Medical text data include large amounts of information regarding patients, which increases the sequence length. Hence, a few studies have attempted to extract entities from the text as concise features and provide domain-specific knowledge for clinical text classification. However, it is still insufficient to inject them into the model effectively. Thus, we propose Entity-enhanced BERT (E-BERT), which utilizes the structural attributes of BERT for medical specialty prediction. E-BERT has an entity embedding layer and entity-aware attention to inject domain-specific knowledge and focus on relationships between medical-related entities within the sequences. Experimental results on clinical questionnaire data demonstrate the superiority of E-BERT over the other benchmark models, regardless of the input sequence length. Moreover, the visualization results for the effects of entity-aware attention prove that E-BERT effectively incorporate domain-specific knowledge and other information, enabling the capture of contextual information in the text. Finally, the robustness and applicability of the proposed method is explored by applying it to other Pre-trained Language Models. These effective medical specialty predictive model can provide practical information to first-visit patients, resulting in streamlining the diagnostic process and improving the quality of medical consultations.", "authors": "Lee S; Han YJ; Park HJ; Lee BH; Son D; Kim S; Yang H; Han T; Kim E; Han SW", "first_author_affiliation": "School of Industrial and Management Engineering, Korea University, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea.", "journal": "PloS one", "pub_date": "2025-01-30", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0317795", "score": "3.8", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39866138", "title": "Is There Novel &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG Biodistribution in the Digital PET/CT Era?

Staff members and leaders could examine patient feedback data to identify service failures and take appropriate action to prevent their recurrence in hospitals. A patient experience dashboard can be developed to document and visualize remedial actions taken by hospitals against each past service failure and shared with all stakeholders.<h4>Practice implications</h4>Reorienting health care as a service where hospitals immediately listen to patients and promptly address their questions and concerns may help to strengthen the continuity of health care services offered by hospitals as well as improve their financial position, quality of care, and the overall patient experience.", "authors": "Chakraborty S; Pag\u00e1n JA", "first_author_affiliation": "", "journal": "Health care management review", "pub_date": "2025-01-27", "doi": "10.1097/hmr.0000000000000435", "score": "3.0", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39876545", "title": "Assessment of a New CT Detector and Filtration Technology: Part 2-Image Quality in Phantoms, Cadavers, and Patients. ", "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to evaluate the image quality of a commercial CT scanner equipped with a novel detector and filtration technology called PureVision Optics (PVO). CT number, noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), modulation transfer function (MTF), and noise power spectrum (NPS) were assessed using the ACR CT Accreditation phantom scanned with various acquisitions at 80\u2009kV, 100\u2009kV, 120\u2009kV, and 135\u2009kV, each with multiple CTDIvol values of 20\u2009mGy, 40\u2009mGy, and 65\u2009mGy. Artifacts were evaluated in an anthropomorphic head phantom, a cadaver head, and in patient studies. Two neuroradiologists assessed image quality features in various patients who were examined with unenhanced brain CT on both scanners. Compared with the conventional scanner, for the same CTDIvol, the PVO scanner produced 20.3% less image noise (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 18.9% higher CNR (P\u2009<\u20090.01), and 24.6% higher spatial resolution (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Streak artifacts were less severe with the PVO scanner for the phantom, cadaver, and patient scans (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Radiologists scored the PVO scanner as significantly better for visualization of the cerebrospinal fluid space over the cerebral sulci in high convexity, image noise in gray and white matter, and artifacts in the posterior fossa. They also significantly preferred the PVO scanner for visualization of the border between brain gray and white matter, cerebrospinal fluid space around the mesencephalon, and overall diagnostic acceptability. For matched CTDIvol values, the scanner equipped with PVO technology produced better objective and subjective image quality metrics in brain CT imaging compared with a conventional CT scanner without PVO. In clinical settings, PVO may allow for lower doses while enhancing imaging through dense areas, improving visualization of subtle details, and offering more effective options for examining obese patients.This research received financial support from Canon Medical Systems USA.

Ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion is a superior alternative to standard technique (palpation and visualization) in high-risk patients.<h4>Objective</h4>To compare first-time insertion success of PIVCs inserted with ultrasound guidance compared with standard technique (palpation and visualization) across all risk categories in the general pediatric hospital population.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>An open-label, pragmatic, superiority, randomized clinical trial was conducted in an Australian quaternary pediatric hospital. Children (ages 0-18 years) requiring PIVC insertion were included between July 2021 and December 2022. One catheter was studied per patient, and analysis was by intention to treat. Data analysis was performed from April to October 2023.<h4>Intervention</h4>Eligible children were randomly assigned (1:1 using computer-generated randomization and concealed allocation) to receive ultrasound-guided or standard PIVC insertion. Randomization was stratified by insertion difficulty (low, medium, or high risk) defined using a standardized tool.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The primary outcome was first-time insertion success. Secondary outcomes included number of insertion attempts, insertion failure, postinsertion complications, dwell time, patient and parent satisfaction, and health care costs.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 164 children were randomly assigned to ultrasound-guided insertion (n\u2009=\u200984) or standard care (n\u2009=\u200980), with 81 (96.4%) and 78 (97.5%) receiving their allocated intervention, respectively. The median (IQR) age was 24 (10-120) months, and 93 children (56.7%) were male. First-time insertion success was higher with ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion (72 children [85.7%]) compared with standard technique (26 children [32.5%]) (risk difference [RD], 53.6%; 95% CI, 41.7%-65.4%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Ultrasound-guided insertion led to significantly greater first-time insertion success across all risk categories, with the following RDs: low risk, 30.8% (95% CI, 8.1%-53.5%); medium risk, 56.2% (95% CI, 37.1%-75.3%); and high risk, 69.6% (95% CI, 52.3%-87.0%). Ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion had higher immediate health care costs (between group difference in total mean cost per person, A$9.33; 95% credible interval, A$8.83-A$10.86 [US $5.83; 95% credible interval, $5.52-$6.78]).<h4>Conclusion and relevance</h4>These findings suggest that ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion improves first-time insertion success across all risk categories in pediatrics, supporting the widespread adoption of ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion in children.<h4>Trial registration</h4>anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12621000206820.", "authors": "Kleidon TM; Schults JA; Royle RH; Gibson V; Ware RS; Andresen E; Cattanach P; Dean A; Pitt C; Ramstedt M; Byrnes J; Nelmes P; Rickard CM; Ullman AJ", "first_author_affiliation": "Vascular Assessment and Management Service, Department of Anaesthesia and Pain, Queensland Children's Hospital, Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, Queensland, Australia.", "journal": "JAMA pediatrics", "pub_date": "2025-01-27", "doi": "10.1001/jamapediatrics.2024.5581", "score": "3.0", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39886874", "title": "Bibliometric analysis of global research status and trends of circadian rhythms in cancer from 2004 to 2024.

Our algorithm combines the feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the global computation capability of Transformer architecture.

However, accurately evaluating the malignant potential of indeterminate lung nodules remains a challenge. Carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6), a potential biomarker for distinguishing benign pulmonary nodules from LUAD, may be leveraged for noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to aid LUAD diagnosis. This study utilized mRNA, protein, and survival datasets of LUAD patients, along with an animal model of malignant pulmonary nodules, to investigate CEACAM6 expression specificity and its correlation with LUAD. Targeting ligands for CEACAM6 were designed using the Rosetta platform, labeled with [68Ga]Ga, and screened through high-throughput PET imaging to identify the optimal tracer. CEACAM6 was found to be specifically overexpressed in LUAD and was significantly associated with poor prognosis and disease progression. In vivo, [68Ga]Ga-NODA-P3 demonstrated high specificity for delineating CEACAM6-positive A549 xenografts, a LUAD model, via PET imaging, achieving a highest target-to-background ratio of 7.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44. Region of interest (ROI) analysis showed significantly higher tracer uptake in A549 xenografts compared to CEACAM6-negative Huh7 xenografts (a hepatocellular carcinoma model) at 30\u00a0min post-injection (1.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10%ID/g vs. 0.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06%ID/g).

Three steps were undertaken: i) selecting main sleep disorder classifications and main disorders within them, ii) systematically extracting CSC-related content, and iii) analyzing the evolution of CSC presence through quantification (Jaccard index) and visualization (radar plots).<h4>Results</h4>The fifth edition, text revision of the DSM (DSM-5-TR) includes CSC in five of nine main sleep disorders, compared to two in the third edition, text revision of the ICSD (ICSD-3-TR) (circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder and nightmare disorder). The overlap between DSM-5-TR and ICSD-3-TR is moderate (Jaccard index = 0.40). The overlap between DSM versions is higher (0.53). Conversely, ICSD revisions exhibit minimal similarity (0.16).

All parameters changed significantly after 1 week of lens wear (p<0.05), except for velocity of corneal apex at the first and second applanation times highest concavity time, radius, stiffness parameter at A1 and stress-strain index. After 1 day, central corneal thickness, first applanation time, second applanation time, deformation amplitude ratio (2 mm), and Corvis biomechanical index (CBI) remained stable (p>0.05).

Trop2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (Trodelvy), has shown efficacy in targeting this antigen. Leveraging the enhanced specificity of ADCs, we conducted the first immunoPET imaging study of Trop2 expression in gastric cancer (GC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models using <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled Trodelvy ([<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy). This approach enables preclinical screening to identify patients who may benefit from targeted therapies.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Trop2 expression levels in GC and TNBC cell lines (NCI-N87, HGC-27, MDST8, and MDA-MB-468) were assessed via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Labeling of DFO-Trodelvy with <sup>89</sup>Zr was performed in Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> buffer at pH 7 (37\u00a0\u00b0C, 1.5\u00a0h).

ImmunoPET imaging with [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy was performed at various time points to confirm its in vivo targeting. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses were conducted on tumor tissues from tumor-bearing mice.<h4>Results</h4>The radiochemical yield of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy exceeded 90%, with a radiochemical purity (RCP) greater than 99%. Trop2 expression was high in MDA-MB-468 and NCI-N87 cells, while it was low in MDST8 and HGC-27 cells. The KD values of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy were 9.44\u00a0nM for MDA-MB-468 and 3.51\u00a0nM for NCI-N87 cells. ImmunoPET imaging with [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy provided clear visualization of tumor morphology in MDA-MB-468 and NCI-N87 models (n\u2009=\u20093) as early as 6\u00a0h post-injection. Tumor uptake of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy increased over time, peaking at 48\u00a0h (MDA-MB-468: 10.03\u2009\u00b1\u20091.26%ID/g; NCI-N87: 14.30\u2009\u00b1\u20092.09%ID/g), and was significantly higher than in the MDST8 (5.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.71%ID/g) and HGC-27 (4.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54%ID/g) models. Co-injection with 2\u00a0mg of unlabeled Trodelvy significantly reduced uptake in NCI-N87 and MDA-MB-468 tumors (P\u2009<\u20090.001). A high target-to-non-target ratio was observed at 48\u00a0h, showing specific tumor uptake and minimal off-target accumulation.

However, smartphone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) provide complementary information to in-clinic visits by collecting real-time, frequent, and longitudinal data that are ecologically valid. While these methods are promising, they are often prone to various technical obstacles. However, despite the potential of smartphone-based EMAs, they face technical obstacles that impact adaptability, availability, and interoperability across devices and operating systems. Deficiencies in these areas can contribute to selection bias by excluding participants with unsupported devices or limited digital literacy, increase development and maintenance costs, and extend deployment timelines. Moreover, these limitations not only impede the configurability of existing solutions but also hinder their adoption for addressing diverse clinical challenges. The primary aim of this research was to develop a cross-platform EMA app that ensures a uniform user experience and core features across various operating systems. Emphasis was placed on maximizing the integration and adaptability to various study designs, all while maintaining strict adherence to security and privacy protocols. JTrack-EMA+ was designed and implemented per the FAIR (findable, accessible, interpretable, and reusable) principles in both its architecture and data management layers, thereby reducing the burden of integration for clinicians and researchers. JTrack-EMA+ was built using the Flutter framework, enabling it to run seamlessly across different platforms. This platform comprises two main components. JDash (Research Centre J\u00fclich, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Brain and Behaviour [INM-7]) is an online management tool created using Python (Python Software Foundation) with the Django (Django Software Foundation) framework. This online dashboard offers comprehensive study management tools, including assessment design, user administration, data quality control, and a reminder casting center. The JTrack-EMA+ app supports a wide range of question types, allowing flexibility in assessment design. It also has configurable assessment logic and the ability to include supplementary materials for a richer user experience. It strongly commits to security and privacy and complies with the General Data Protection Regulations to safeguard user data and ensure confidentiality. We investigated our platform in a pilot study with 480 days of follow-up to assess participants' compliance. The 6-month average compliance was 49.3%, significantly declining (P=.004) from 66.7% in the first month to 42% in the sixth month. The JTrack-EMA+ platform prioritizes platform-independent architecture, providing an easy entry point for clinical researchers to deploy EMA in their respective clinical studies. Remote and home-based assessments of EMA using this platform can provide valuable insights into patients' daily lives, particularly in a population with limited mobility or inconsistent access to health care services.", "authors": "Sahandi Far M; Fischer JM; Senge S; Rathmakers R; Meissner T; Schneble D; Narava M; Eickhoff SB; Dukart J", "first_author_affiliation": "Research Centre J\u00fclich, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Brain and Behaviour (INM-7), J\u00fclich, Germany.", "journal": "Journal of medical Internet research", "pub_date": "2025-01-28", "doi": "10.2196/51689", "score": "2.0", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39874072", "title": "A Digital Tool (Technology-Assisted Problem Management Plus) for Lay Health Workers to Address Common Mental Health Disorders: Co-production and Usability Study in Pakistan.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Mental health remains among the top 10 leading causes of disease burden globally, and there is a significant treatment gap due to limited resources, stigma, limited accessibility, and low perceived need for treatment. Problem Management Plus, a World Health Organization-endorsed brief psychological intervention for mental health disorders, has been shown to be effective and cost-effective in various countries globally but faces implementation challenges, such as quality control in training, supervision, and delivery. While digital technologies to foster mental health care have the potential to close treatment gaps and address the issues of quality control, their development requires context-specific, interdisciplinary, and participatory approaches to enhance impact and acceptance.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to co-produce Technology-Assisted Problem Management Plus (TA-PM+) for \"lady health workers\" (LHWs; this is the terminology used by the Lady Health Worker Programme for lay health workers) to efficiently deliver sessions to women with symptoms of common mental health disorders within the community settings of Pakistan and conducted usability testing in community settings.<h4>Methods</h4>A 3-stage framework was used for co-producing and prototyping the intervention. Stage 1 (evidence review and stakeholder consultation) included 3 focus group discussions with 32 LHWs and 7 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders working in the health system or at the health policy level. Thematic analyses using the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behavioral Change (COM-B) model were conducted. Stage 2 included over eight online workshops, and a multidisciplinary intervention development group co-produced TA-PM+. Stage 3 (prototyping) involved 2 usability testing rounds. In round 1 conducted in laboratory settings, 6 LHWs participated in role plays and completed the 15-item mHealth Usability App Questionnaire (MUAQ) (score range 0-7). In round 2 conducted in community settings, trained LHWs delivered the intervention to 6 participants screened for depression and anxiety. Data were collected using the MUAQ completed by LHWs and the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) (score range 0-46) completed by participants.<h4>Results</h4>Qualitative analysis indicated that a lack of digital skills among LHWs, high workload, resource scarcity for digitization (specifically internet bandwidth in the community), and need for comprehensive training were barriers for TA-PM+ implementation in the community through LHWs. Training, professional support, user guidance, an easy and automated interface, offline functionalities, incentives, and strong credibility among communities were perceived to enhance the capability, opportunity, and motivation of LHWs to implement TA-PM+. TA-PM+ was co-produced with features like an automated interface, a personal dashboard, guidance videos, and a connected supervisory panel. The mean MUAQ score was 5.62 in round 1 of usability testing and improved to 5.96 after incorporating LHW feedback in round 2. The mean PSQ score for TA-PM+ was 40 in round 2.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Co-production of TA-PM+ for LHWs balanced context and evidence. The 3-stage iterative development approach resulted in high usability and acceptability of TA-PM+ for LHWs and participants.", "authors": "Saleem M; Zafar S; Klein T; Koesters M; Bashir A; Fuhr DC; Sikander S; Zeeb H", "first_author_affiliation": "Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.", "journal": "JMIR formative research", "pub_date": "2025-01-28", "doi": "10.2196/59414", "score": "2.0", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Co-production; Low- And Middle-income Countries; Digital Technology; Common Mental Health Disorders; Lay Health Worker Programme; Digital Intervention; Digital Mental Health; Problem Management Plus"}];
