A personalized prediction of CVA outcomes would allow care professionals to better inform patients and informal caregivers. Several accurate prediction models have been created, but acceptance and proper implementation of the models are prerequisites for model adoption.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to assess the added value of a prediction model for long-term outcomes of rehabilitation after CVA and evaluate how it can best be displayed, implemented, and integrated into the care process.<h4>Methods</h4>We designed a mock-up version, including visualizations, based on our recently developed prediction model. We conducted focus groups with CVA patients and informal caregivers, and separate focus groups with health care professionals (HCPs). Their opinions on the current information management and the model were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Lastly, a Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovations (MIDI) questionnaire was used to collect insights into the prediction model and visualizations with HCPs.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis of 6 focus groups, with 9 patients, 4 informal caregivers, and 8 HCPs, resulted in 10 themes in 3 categories: evaluation of the current care process (information absorption, expectations of rehabilitation, prediction of outcomes, and decision aid), content of the prediction model (reliability, relevance, and influence on the care process), and accessibility of the model (ease of understanding, model type preference, and moment of use). We extracted recommendations for the prediction model and visualizations. The results of the questionnaire survey (9 responses, 56% response rate) underscored the themes of the focus groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a need for the use of a prediction model to assess CVA outcomes, as indicated by the general approval of participants in both the focus groups and the questionnaire survey. We recommend that the prediction model be geared toward HCPs, as they can provide the context necessary for patients and informal caregivers.

Due to limitations of conventional two-dimensional histological methods, the complexity and the detailed anatomy of the lung blood circulation might be overlooked. In this study, we demonstrate the practical use of optical serial block face imaging (SBFI), ex vivo microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), and nondestructive optical tomography for visualization and quantification of the pulmonary circulation's 3D architecture from macro- to micro-structural levels in murine lung samples. We demonstrate that SBFI can provide rapid, cost-effective, and label-free visualization of mouse lung macrostructures and large pulmonary vessels. Micro-CT offers high-resolution imaging and captures microvascular and (pre)capillary structures, with microstructural quantification. Optical microscopy techniques such as optical projection tomography (OPT) and light sheet fluorescence microscopy, allows noninvasive, mesoscopic imaging of optically cleared mouse lungs, still enabling 3D microscopic reconstruction down to the precapillary level. By integrating SBFI, micro-CT, and nondestructive optical microscopy, we provide a framework for detailed and 3D understanding of the pulmonary circulation, with emphasis on vascular pruning and rarefaction. Our study showcases the applicability and complementarity of these techniques for organ-level vascular imaging, offering researchers flexibility in selecting the optimal approach based on their specific requirements. In conclusion, we propose 3D-directed approaches for a detailed whole-organ view on the pulmonary vasculature in health and disease, to advance our current knowledge of diseases affecting the pulmonary vasculature.", "authors": "Tielemans B; Marain NF; Kerstens A; Peredo N; Coll-Llad\u00f3 M; Gritti N; de Villemagne P; Dorval P; Geudens V; Orlitov\u00e1 M; Munck S; Leszczy\u0144ski B; Swoger J; Velde GV", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Imaging and Pathology, Biomedical MRI KU Leuven Leuven Belgium.", "journal": "Pulmonary circulation", "pub_date": "2025-01-21", "doi": "10.1002/pul2.70038", "score": "7.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)", "api_keywords": "Optical imaging; Microcomputed Tomography; Pulmonary Vasculature; Serial Block Face Imaging; 3D Visualization And Evaluation"}, {"pmid": "39835738", "title": "Advances in Organic Fluorescent and Colorimetric Probes for The Detection of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Their Applications in Cancer Cell Imaging (2020-2024).", "abstract": "Organic fluorescence and colorimetric probes have emerged as vital tools for detecting metal ions, due to their high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid response times. Copper, an essential trace element, plays a critical role in biological systems, yet its imbalance can lead to severe disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and Wilson's disease. Over the past few years, advancements in probe design have unlocked innovative avenues for not only detecting Cu<sup>2+</sup> in environmental and biological samples but also for visualizing its distribution through fluorescence imaging. These probes offering robust performance under diverse conditions. Fluorescence imaging using these probes plays a pivotal role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring by offering real-time visualization of tumor morphology and biomolecular interactions at cellular and tissue levels. This review aims to explore the diversity of organic fluorescence and colorimetric probes developed for the detection of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, with a particular focus on their applications in fluorescence imaging from 2020 to 2024. The discussion highlights the use of these probes in visualizing Cu<sup>2+</sup> in various cancer cells such as SiHa, HCT 116, GES-1, RAW 264.7, HepG2, HeLa, MCF-7 and DrG cell lines, tissues, and small living organisms. By targeting cancer-specific pathways and monitoring copper-related physiological changes, these probes have significantly advanced the fields of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

The method provides an opportunity for early detection of large genetic abnormalities without an increased risk of miscarriage due to invasive procedures. Commercial applications for use at clinical laboratories often take advantage of DNA sequencing technologies and include the bioinformatic workup of the sequence data. The interpretation of the test results and the clinical report writing, however, remains the responsibility of the diagnostic laboratory. In order to facilitate this step, we developed NIPTviewer, a web-based application to visualize and guide the interpretation of NIPT data results.<h4>Results</h4>NIPTviewer has a database functionality to store the NIPT results and a web interface for user interaction and visualization. The application has been implemented as part of a novel analysis pipeline for NIPT in a diagnostic laboratory at Uppsala University Hospital. The validation data set included 84 previously analyzed plasma samples with known results regarding chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. They were sequenced in six different experiments, uploaded to NIPTviewer and assigned to a clinical laboratory geneticist for interpretation.

To this end, we developed functional genomic imaging (FGI), a visualization tool designed to assist clinicians in interpreting RNA-Seq results from patient samples. FGI uses weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), followed by a modified Phenograph clustering algorithm to identify co-expression gene clusters. These gene modules were annotated and projected onto a t-SNE map for visualization. Annotation of FGI gene clusters revealed three categories: tissue-specific, functional, and positional. These clusters may be used to build tumor subtypes with pre-annotated functions. At the multi-cancer cohort level, tissue-specific clusters are enriched, whereas at the single cancer level, such as in lung cancer or ovarian cancer, positional clusters can be more prominent. Moreover, FGI analysis could also reveal molecular tumor subtypes not documented in clinical records and generated a more detailed co-expression gene cluster map. Based on different levels of FGI modeling, each individual tumor sample can be customized to display various types of information such as tissue origin, molecular subtypes, immune activation status, stromal signaling pathways, cell cycle activity, and potential amplicon regions which can aid in diagnosis and guide treatment decisions.

", "abstract": "Gram-positive bacteria pose significant threats to human health, necessitating the development of targeted bacterial detection and eradication strategies. Nevertheless, current approaches often suffer from poor targeting specificity. Herein, the study utilizes purple rice lixivium to synthesize biomass carbon dots (termed BCDs) with wheat germ agglutinin-like residues for precisely targeting Gram-positive bacteria. Subsequently, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules are grafted onto BCDs to yield FITC-labeled BCDs (termed CDFs), which can selectively and rapidly (\u22645 min) stain bacterial cell wall and particularly target the peptidoglycan component. Strikingly, CDFs achieve superselective visualization of Gram-positive bacteria even in the presence of mammalian cells and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, protoporphyrin (PpIX) molecules are conjugated onto BCDs to yield PpIX-modified BCDs (termed CDPs), which can induce bacterial aggregation and in situ generate singlet oxygen for realizing enhanced antibacterial photodynamic therapy (PDT). At the minimum bactericidal concentration of CDPs (PpIX: 5 \u00b5g\u00a0mL-1), CDP-mediated PDT disrupts bacterial structure and metabolism pathways, thereby affecting bacterial interactions to eradicate biofilms. Importantly, CDP-mediated PDT efficiently modulates antiinflammatory responses to promote wound healing in the bacteria-infected mice.

Two radiologists independently assigned ultrasound categories to round-1 examinations and visualization scores to round-1 and round-2 examinations; a third radiologist adjudicated disagreements. AFP was considered positive if elevated or increasing from pre-enrollment values, per v2024 criteria. Reference standard for HCC was positive biopsy or LR-5 observation on MRI. Diagnostic performance was compared between v2017 and v2024. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of round-2 VIS-C, with attention to risk factors for VIS-C described in v2024. <b>Results:</b> HCC was diagnosed in 28 (6.9%) patients. For reader 1, v2024, compared with v2017, showed greater sensitivity for reader 1 (64.3% vs 42.9%, p=.03) and reader 2 (64.3% vs 39.3%, p=.02), and lower specificity for reader 1 (82.0% vs 92.6%, p<.001) and reader 2 (82.3% vs 92.9%, p<.001). All seven patients with HCC detected by v2024 but not v2017 using consensus assessments had an increasing AFP; two also had an elevated AFP. In 299 patients who underwent round-2 ultrasound after negative round-1 v2024 surveillance results, the only independent predictor of round-2 VIS-C was round-1 VIS-C (adjusted OR=21.0, [95% CI, 10.8-40.8], p<.001). In 88 of these patients with round-1 VIS-C, no v2024 risk factor showed significant univariable association with repeat VIS-C. <b>Conclusion:</b> Compared with v2017, LI-RADS Ultrasound Surveillance v2024 had higher sensitivity but lower specificity for HCC detection, related primarily to increasing, rather than elevated, AFP.

Here, we aimed to develop a nomogram model utilizing multimodal data for the risk stratification of AF recurrence following catheter ablation in individuals diagnosed with PFO and new-onset PAF.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients with PFO and PAF who underwent catheter ablation at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 2018 to June 2020 were consecutively enrolled. The identification of potential risk factors was conducted using the regression method known as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Subsequently, multivariate COX regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent risk factors, after which a nomogram scoring system was developed. The nomogram's performance was assessed via various statistical measures, including receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>The dataset was partitioned into the development cohort (n\u2009=\u2009102) and the validation cohort (n\u2009=\u200943) using a 7:3 ratio. The constructed nomogram included four clinical variables: age, diabetes mellitus, lipoprotein (a), and right ventricular diameter. The area under the curve values of the development and validation cohorts at 1, 2, and 3\u00a0years post-catheter ablation were 0.911, 0.812, and 0.786 and 0.842, 0.761, and 0.785, respectively. Additionally, the nomogram demonstrated a significant correlation between the predicted and actual outcomes in the development and validation cohorts, indicating its excellent calibration.

We also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists with and without the assistance of the optimal model. Model performance was assessed through discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability.<h4>Results</h4>The MVIT-MLKA model demonstrated superior performance in classifying pancreatic lesions, achieving an AUC of 0.974 (95% CI 0.967-0.980) in the training set, 0.935 (95% CI 0.915-0.954) in the internal testing set, and 0.924 (95% CI 0.902-0.945) in the external validation set, outperforming traditional models and other deep learning models (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Radiologists aided by the MVIT-MLKA model showed significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared to those without model assistance (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Grad-CAM visualization enhanced model interpretability by effectively highlighting key lesion areas.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The MVIT-MLKA model efficiently differentiates between benign and malignant pancreatic lesions, surpassing traditional methods and significantly improving radiologists' diagnostic performance.

Our study systematically searched for German-language, web-based health information on the prevention and prediction of food allergies in children and assessed their content and quality.<h4>Methods</h4>In July 2022, four researchers conducted a systematic Google search for German-language web-based health information (HI) on the prediction and prevention of food allergies in children. They searched independently of each other with a predefined search algorithm. Two independent reviewers analyzed the data using qualitative and quantitative content analysis (step/analysis 1) and assessed the quality of HI (step/analysis 2) using a comprehensive criteria catalog (transparency, text design, content, language, presentation of frequencies and statistical information, visualization, and accessibility).<h4>Results</h4>The systematic search yielded 59 websites, which were provided by nine sectors. The most frequent sectors were \"Health portals and expert opinions\" and \"Guidelines/scientific and medical specialized information\" (22 % each). The content analysis (step 1) showed, among other things, that the topic of prediction was only implicitly addressed. 49 materials (83 %) contained guideline-compliant information. However, there were also 26 materials (44 %) whose content was not in line with the current S3 guideline on allergy prevention. Quality assessment (step 2) revealed that only a small number of the 43 HI received good or very good ratings regarding the transparency (n = 3, 7 %) and content (n = 9, 21 %) criteria. The criterion concerning frequencies and statistical information was rated good or very good quality in only 11 HI (26 %). Almost all HI met the quality criteria for language (n = 38, 88 %), text design (n = 43, 100 %), and visualization (n = 43, 100 %). None of the evaluated HI was given a good or very good rating in terms of accessibility criteria. The analysis by sector revealed only minor differences (Mean of the seven criteria: 56-69 %).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The quality of the available web-based health information on the prevention and prediction of food allergies in children is highly heterogeneous. There is need for improvement in terms of accessibility, content (e. g., selective presentation of prevention measures), and transparency (e. g., missing details of contacts). Further research is needed for expanding the user perspective and analyzing social media in the context of prediction and prevention of food allergies in children.", "authors": "H\u00f6rold M; Rohr M; Beyer M; Bauer T; K\u00f6nig M; Gerhardinger K; Apfelbacher C; Brandstetter S", "first_author_affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Sozialmedizin und Gesundheitssystemforschung, Medizinische Fakult\u00e4t, Otto-von-Guericke-Universit\u00e4t Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Deutschland.

The approach focused on achieving high contrast and clarity in key dental features, including tooth roots, morphology, and periapical lesions, by applying a 3D U-Net deep learning model to generate an arch surface and align the panoramic view.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study analyzed anonymized cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans from 312 patients (mean age 40\u2009years; range 10-78; 41.3% male, 58.7% female). A 3D U-Net deep learning model segmented the jaw and dentition, facilitating panoramic view generation. During preprocessing, CBCT scans were binarized, and a cylindrical reconstruction method aligned the arch along a straight coordinate system, reducing data size for efficient processing. The 3D U-Net segmented the jaw and dentition in two steps, after which the panoramic view was reconstructed using 3D spline curves fitted to the arch, defining the optimal 3D reconstruction zone. This ensured the panoramic view captured essential anatomical details with high contrast and clarity. To evaluate performance, we compared contrast between tooth roots and alveolar bone and assessed intersection over union (IoU) values for tooth shapes and periapical lesions (#42, #44, #46) relative to the conventional method, demonstrating enhanced clarity and improved visualization of critical dental structures.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed method outperformed the conventional approach, showing significant improvements in the contrast between tooth roots and alveolar bone, particularly for tooth #42. It also demonstrated higher IoU values in tooth morphology comparisons, indicating superior shape alignment. Additionally, when evaluating periapical lesions, our method achieved higher performance with thinner layers, resulting in several statistically significant outcomes. Specifically, average pixel values within lesions were higher for certain layer thicknesses, demonstrating enhanced visibility of lesion boundaries and better visualization.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The fully automated AI-based panoramic view generation method successfully created a 3D reconstruction zone centered on the teeth, enabling consistent observation of dental and surrounding tissue structures with high contrast across reconstruction widths. By accurately segmenting the dental arch and defining the optimal reconstruction zone, this method shows significant advantages in detecting pathological changes, potentially reducing clinician fatigue during interpretation while enhancing clinical decision-making accuracy. Future research will focus on further developing and testing this approach to ensure robust performance across diverse patient cases with varied dental and maxillofacial structures, thereby increasing the model's utility in clinical settings.<h4>Advances in knowledge</h4>This study introduces a novel method for achieving clearer, well-aligned panoramic views focused on the dentition, providing significant improvements over conventional methods.", "authors": "Kim N; Park H; Jung YH; Hwang JJ", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, Korea.", "journal": "Dento maxillo facial radiology", "pub_date": "2025-01-20", "doi": "10.1093/dmfr/twaf006", "score": "3.0", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39838176", "title": "Clinical application of 3D slicer reconstruction and 3D printing localization combined with neuroendoscopy technology in VPS surgery.", "abstract": "To explore techniques, advantages and disadvantages of 3D Slicer reconstruction and 3D printing localization technology combined with transcranial neuroendoscopy in ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery.

Triage assessment urgently requires the use of simple, rapid tools to screen patients with chest pain for high-risk condition to improve patient outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>After data preprocessing and feature selection, univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify potential predictors associated with acute non-traumatic chest pain. A nomogram was built based on the predictors, and an internal evaluation was performed using bootstrap resampling methods. The model was also externally validated in this center.

Mitotic integrity and genomic stability are crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. The transcription factor NKX6.3 has emerged as a potential regulator of these processes in gastric epithelial cells, prompting an investigation into its role in gastric cancer development. We employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques to elucidate the impact of NKX6.3 depletion on mitotic dynamics and genomic stability in gastric epithelial cells. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were conducted to assess the expression of mitosis-related genes and proteins. Flow cytometry was utilized to evaluate cell cycle distribution, while immunofluorescence microscopy enabled the visualization of mitotic abnormalities. Statistical analyses, including Student's t-test and ANOVA, were performed to determine the significance of our findings. Our results demonstrate that NKX6.3 depletion leads to significant mitotic defects, characterized by increased chromosome misalignment and lagging chromosomes during anaphase. These abnormalities corresponded with elevated levels of genomic instability markers, indicating compromised genomic integrity. Furthermore, the loss of NKX6.3 resulted in altered expression of key regulatory proteins involved in mitosis and DNA repair pathways, suggesting a mechanistic link between NKX6.3 and the maintenance of genomic stability in gastric epithelial cells. Depletion of NKX6.3 resulted in accelerated cell cycle progression and the formation of abnormal mitotic figures, leading to genomic instability characterized by increased DNA content and structural abnormalities. In both in vitro and xenograft models, the depletion of NKX6.3 significantly upregulated AurkA and TPX2, which correlated with gains in DNA copy number. An inverse relationship was observed between NKX6.3 expression and the levels of AurkA and TPX2 in human gastric cancer tissues. This study highlights the essential role of NKX6.3 in regulating mitotic integrity and genomic stability in gastric carcinogenesis. The findings suggest that targeting NKX6.3 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for improving treatment outcomes in gastric cancer by restoring mitotic fidelity and genomic stability.

Serum miRNA candidates for disease association were selected using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). A miRNA signature combining multiple serum miRNAs was tested in exploratory, validation, and independent validation sets. The synthesis and secretion of diagnostic miRNAs were evaluated using human pancreatic cancer cells.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 284 (150 healthy and 134 PBca) of 827 serum samples were processed within 2\u00a0h of blood collection before freezing, distributed in the same area as that in the t-SNE map, and assigned to an exploratory set. The 193 optimized samples were assigned to either the validation (50 healthy, 47 PBca) or independent validation (50 healthy, 46 PBca) set. Index-1, a combination of five serum miRNAs (hsa-miR-1343-5p, hsa-miR-4632-5p, hsa-miR-4665-5p, hsa-miR-665, and hsa-miR-6803-5p) with disease association in WGCNA, showed a sensitivity and specificity of\u2009>\u200980% and an AUC outperforming that of CA19-9 in the exploratory, validation, and independent validation sets. The AUC of Index-1 was superior to that of CA19-9 (0.856 vs. 0.649, p\u2009=\u20090.038) for detecting T1 tumors. miR-665, a component of Index-1, was expressed in human pancreatic cancer cells, and its transfection inhibited cell growth.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The serum miRNA signature Index-1 is useful for detecting PBca and could facilitate the early diagnosis of PBca. These findings can help improve clinical PBca detection by providing an optimized biomarker that overcomes the limitations of the current standard.", "authors": "Mitsunaga S; Ikeda M; Ueno M; Kobayshi S; Tsuda M; Miki I; Kuwahara T; Hara K; Takayama Y; Matsunaga Y; Hanada K; Shimizu A; Yoshida H; Nomoto T; Takahashi K; Iwamoto H; Iwama H; Hatano E; Nakata K; Nakamura M; Sudo H; Takizawa S; Ochiai A", "first_author_affiliation": "Division of Biomarker Discovery, Exploratory Oncology Research and Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, 6-5-1 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8577, Japan. smitsuna@east.ncc.go.jp.", "journal": "BMC medicine", "pub_date": "2025-01-21", "doi": "10.1186/s12916-025-03849-x", "score": "2.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Biomarker; Circulating Microrna; Pancreatobiliary Cancer"}, {"pmid": "39828866", "title": "Cross-modality PET image synthesis for Parkinson's Disease diagnosis: a leap from [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG to [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]CFT.", "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Dopamine transporter [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET is highly effective for diagnosing Parkinson's Disease (PD), whereas it is not widely available in most hospitals. To develop a deep learning framework to synthesize [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images from real [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET images and leverage their cross-modal correlation to distinguish PD from normal control (NC).<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a deep learning framework to synthesize [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images from real [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET images, and leveraged their cross-modal correlation to distinguish PD from NC. A total of 604 participants (274 with PD and 330 with NC) who underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET scans were included. The quality of the synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images was evaluated through quantitative comparison with the ground-truth images and radiologist visual assessment. The evaluations of PD diagnosis performance were conducted using biomarker-based quantitative analyses (using striatal binding ratios from synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images) and the proposed PD classifier (incorporating both real [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images).<h4>Results</h4>Visualization result shows that the synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images resemble the real ones with no significant differences visible in the error maps. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated that synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images exhibited a high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR: 25.0-28.0) and structural similarity (SSIM: 0.87-0.96) across different unilateral striatal subregions. The radiologists achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 91.9% (\u00b1\u20092.02%) based on synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images, while biomarker-based quantitative analysis of the posterior putamen yielded an AUC of 0.912 (95% CI, 0.889-0.936), and the proposed PD Classifier achieved an AUC of 0.937 (95% CI, 0.916-0.957).<h4>Conclusion</h4>By bridging the gap between [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT, our deep learning framework can significantly enhance PD diagnosis without the need for [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT tracers, thereby expanding the reach of advanced diagnostic tools to clinical settings where [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET imaging is inaccessible.", "authors": "Shen Z; Wang J; Huang H; Lu J; Ge J; Xiong H; Wu P; Ju Z; Lin H; Zhu Y; Yang Y; Liu F; Guan Y; Sun K; Wang J; Wang Q; Zuo C", "first_author_affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.", "journal": "European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging", "pub_date": "2025-01-20", "doi": "10.1007/s00259-025-07096-3", "score": "2.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Diagnosis; Parkinson\u2019s Disease; [18F]fdg Pet; [11C]cft Pet; Cross-modality Image Synthesis"}, {"pmid": "39838909", "title": "Medial Meniscotibial Ligament Deficiency Increases Medial Meniscus Extrusion and Posterior Root Forces.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>There is growing evidence that medial meniscotibial ligament (MTL) deficiency and medial meniscus extrusion may precede the development of some medial meniscus posterior root (MMPR) tears. However, no study has investigated the biomechanical consequences of MTL deficiency on the MMPR.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>(1) MTL deficiency leads to increased medial meniscus extrusion, (2) increased medial meniscus extrusion is correlated with increased compression and shear forces at the MMPR, and (3) MTL repair restores medial meniscus extrusion and MMPR forces to native levels.<h4>Study design</h4>Controlled laboratory study.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifteen pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were tested. Specimens were organized into 3 groups according to a balanced incomplete block design: (1) native, (2) MTL deficiency, and (3) MTL repair. For the MTL deficiency group, a 3-cm deficiency in the MTL was developed under direct arthroscopic visualization. Specimens in the MTL repair group underwent a 2-anchor repair that compressed the joint capsule to the proximal tibia. All specimens were biomechanically tested in full extension with a tensile testing machine. The specimens underwent cyclic loading for 10,000 cycles at 1 Hz and compression of 20 to 500 N, with a 500-N compressive force applied for 30 seconds after the 0th, 100th, 1000th, and 10,000th cycles. Ultrasound was used to measure medial meniscus extrusion. Shear and compressive forces at the MMPR were measured with a 3-axis sensor installed inferior to the MMPR tibial attachment.<h4>Results</h4>Medial meniscus extrusion was significantly increased in the MTL deficiency group compared with the native group (0th: 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 mm vs 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 mm, <i>P</i> < .05; 100th: 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm vs 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 mm, <i>P</i> < .05; 1000th: 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 mm vs 1.8 \u00b1 0.2 mm, <i>P</i> < .05; 10,000th: 3.5 \u00b1 0.3 mm vs 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 mm, <i>P</i> < .05). Compression root force was significantly increased in the MTL deficiency group compared with the native group at all cyclic loading points (0th: 21.7 \u00b1 12.8 N vs 13.6 \u00b1 2.4 N, <i>P</i> < .05; 100th: 18.9 \u00b1 11.0 N vs 12.1 \u00b1 7.5 N, <i>P</i> < .05; 1000th: 16.5 \u00b1 9.9 N vs 11.2 \u00b1 7.5 N, <i>P</i> < .05; 10,000th: 12.6 \u00b1 8.6 N vs 9.0 \u00b1 6.9 N, <i>P</i> < .05). Root shear force was significantly increased in the MTL deficiency group compared with the native group at the 0th (17.5 \u00b1 2.5 N vs 13.6 \u00b1 2.4 N, <i>P</i> < .001) and 100th (16.2 \u00b1 2.6 N vs 12.1 \u00b1 2.2 N, <i>P</i> < .001) cycles. Medial meniscus extrusion, root shear force, and compression root force of the MTL repair group were not significantly different from the native group for all cyclic loading points.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Medial MTL deficiency led to increased medial meniscus extrusion as well as greater compression and shear forces at the MMPR compared with the intact and repaired MTL states, suggesting that MTL deficiency may predispose the MMPR to injury in a cadaveric model.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>MTL deficiency predisposes one to medial meniscus extrusion and MMPR tears. Subsequently, MTL repair can potentially correct medial meniscus extrusion and normalize forces at the MMPR.", "authors": "Anderson MJJ; Hollenbeck JFM; Drumm AH; Whicker EA; Brown JR; Garcia AR; Apostolakos JM; Buchalter WH; Cortes N; Whalen RJ; Vidal AF; Provencher MT", "first_author_affiliation": "The Steadman Clinic, Vail, Colorado, USA.", "journal": "The American journal of sports medicine", "pub_date": "2025-01-22", "doi": "10.1177/03635465241309671", "score": "2.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Meniscal Extrusion; Meniscus Root Tear; Meniscotibial Ligament Injury; Meniscotibial Ligament Repair"}, {"pmid": "39847731", "title": "Development and Implementation of Oral Anticancer Agent Tools for a Thematic Quality Improvement Program: A Collaboration Between Hematology Oncology Pharmacist Association and ASCO Quality Training Program.", "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>The Hematology Oncology Pharmacist Association Oral Chemotherapy Collaborative (HOPA OCC) developed practice-based tools to use in program development and improvement for the management of patients receiving oral anticancer agents (OAAs).<h4>Methods</h4>These tools include a baseline OAA program assessment, clinical OAA adherence tool, and OAA dashboard. HOPA OCC distributed these tools to teams participating in the 6-month HOPA ASCO Quality Training Programs (QTPs).
