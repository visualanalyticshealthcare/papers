SynthRO, a dashboard to evaluate and benchmark synthetic tabular data.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The exponential growth in patient data collection by healthcare providers, governments, and private industries is yielding large and diverse datasets that offer new insights into critical medical questions. Leveraging extensive computational resources, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are increasingly utilized to address health-related issues, such as predicting outcomes from Electronic Health Records and detecting patterns in multi-omics data. Despite the proliferation of medical devices based on Artificial Intelligence, data accessibility for research is limited due to privacy concerns. Efforts to de-identify data have met challenges in maintaining effectiveness, particularly with large datasets. As an alternative, synthetic data, that replicate main statistical properties of real patient data, are proposed. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics complicates the selection of appropriate synthetic data generation methods. Effective evaluation of synthetic data must consider resemblance, utility and privacy, tailored to specific applications. Despite available metrics, benchmarking efforts remain limited, necessitating further research in this area.<h4>Results</h4>We present SynthRO (Synthetic data Rank and Order), a user-friendly tool for benchmarking health synthetic tabular data across various contexts. SynthRO offers accessible quality evaluation metrics and automated benchmarking, helping users determine the most suitable synthetic data models for specific use cases by prioritizing metrics and providing consistent quantitative scores. Our dashboard is divided into three main sections: (1) Loading Data section, where users can locally upload real and synthetic datasets; (2) Evaluation section, in which several quality assessments are performed by computing different metrics and measures; (3) Benchmarking section, where users can globally compare synthetic datasets based on quality evaluation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Synthetic data mitigate concerns about privacy and data accessibility, yet lacks standardized evaluation metrics. SynthRO provides an accessible dashboard helping users select suitable synthetic data models, and it also supports various use cases in healthcare, enhancing prognostic scores and enabling federated learning. SynthRO's accessible GUI and modular structure facilitate effective data evaluation, promoting reliability and fairness. Future developments will include temporal data evaluation, further broadening its applicability.", "authors": "Santangelo G; Nicora G; Bellazzi R; Dagliati A", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. gabriele.santangelo01@universitadipavia.it.", "journal": "BMC medical informatics and decision making", "pub_date": "2025-02-18", "doi": "10.1186/s12911-024-02731-9", "score": "12.7", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(title,abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(kw,title,abstract); electronic health record(kw,abstract)", "api_keywords": "Electronic Health Records (Ehrs); Synthetic Data; Benchmarking Tools; Synthetic Tabular Data Evaluation; Utility And Privacy Evaluation"}, {"pmid": "39983107", "title": "Assessing the Feasibility and Utility of Patient-Specific 3D Advanced Visualization Modeling in Cerebrovascular Disease: Retrospective Analysis and Prospective Survey Pilot Study.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence, clinical burden, and health care costs (>US $100 billion) associated with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) will increase significantly as the US population grows and ages over the next 25 years. Existing 2D imaging modalities have inherent limitations in visualizing complex CVD, which may be mitigated with the use of patient-specific 3D advanced visualization (AV) technologies. There remain gaps in knowledge, however, regarding how and with what impact these technologies are being used in CVD.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical attributes and reported utility associated with the use of 3D AV modeling in CVDs, specifically intracerebral arteriovenous malformations.<h4>Methods</h4>This pilot study employs a combination of retrospective analysis and prospective surveys to describe the utilization and utility of patient-specific AV models at a single high-volume certified comprehensive stroke center.<h4>Results</h4>From July 2017 to February 2023, 25 AV models were created for 4 different clinicians. The average patient age was 37.4 years; 44% (11/25) of the patients were African Americans, 52% (13/25) were on public insurance, and 56% (14/25) were associated with a neurovascular procedure. In this study, 18 clinicians with diverse experience responded to AV model surveys, with a 92.2% (166/180) completion rate. There was an average reported utility of 8.0 on a 0-10 scale, with higher scores reflecting increased utility. Compared to 2D viewing, AV models allowed staff to appreciate novel abnormal anatomy, and therefore, they would have changed their therapeutic approach in 45% (23/51) of the cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AV models were used in complex CVDs associated with young, publicly insured individuals requiring resource-intensive interventions. There was strong and diverse clinician engagement with overall report of substantial utility of AV models. Staff clinicians frequently reported novel anatomical and therapeutic insights based on AV models compared to traditional 2D viewing. This study establishes the infrastructure for future larger randomized studies that can be repeated for CVDs or other disease states and incorporate assessments of other AV modalities such as 3D printing and medical extended reality.", "authors": "Sarkar K; Bhimarasetty V; Rahim A; Curtis C; Hughes K", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Academics, Ochsner BioDesign Lab, Ochsner Health, New Orleans, LA, United States.", "journal": "JMIR formative research", "pub_date": "2025-02-21", "doi": "10.2196/51939", "score": "11.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract)", "api_keywords": "Brain; Vessel; Survey; Cerebral; Vein; Artery; Virtual reality; Stroke; Cerebrovascular disease; Cerebrovascular; Usability; 3d Modeling; Medical Simulation; Augmented Reality; 3D Printing; Advanced Visualization; Medical Extended Reality; Intracerebral Arteriovenous Malformations"}, {"pmid": "39962592", "title": "Knowledge mapping of childhood infectious mononucleosis: a bibliometric analysis for the twenty-first century.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The incidence of infectious mononucleosis (IM) has increased in recent years, particularly in the pediatric population, and there are currently no specific drugs available, posing a threat to the lives and health of children worldwide. Although some results have been published, there is a lack of systematic review and summarization of current research.<h4>Methods</h4>Based on screening criteria, literature on IM in children from 2000 to 2023 was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. The included literature's indicators (country, institution, journal, author, keywords, and references) were analyzed and visualized using Citespace, VOSviewer software, and the Bibliometrix program package.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 538 eligible publications were included in this study. The number of publications has been on an upward trend during this century, with great potential for future growth. The countries with the most publications are the USA and China, and Capital Medical University is the most contributing institution. Hjalgrim, Henrik and Cohen, Jeffrey, I are among the field's most influential authors and co-cited authors. Among the major journals, the JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY had the highest output and the JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES was the most frequently cited. The reference with the highest outbreak intensity was Ramagopalan, SV, LANCET NEUROLOGY, 2010. Through in-depth analysis of the keywords, we conclude that the characteristics of diagnosis and assessment of IM, the association of IM with other diseases, and interventions for IM are the current hot topics of research in the field and that the pathogenesis of IM due to EBV is a cutting-edge topic in the field. This study also analyzes the reasons for geographical research differences and proposes a new \"increasing quantity-improving quality-integrating\" cooperation model.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study's hotspots and frontiers reflect the current status and trends in pediatric IM, and these findings provide important insights to guide future research and optimize therapeutic strategies. In the future, there is a need to strengthen international collaboration and cooperation, conduct RCTs with large sample sizes, and promote the development of new drugs in mechanism research.", "authors": "Cui Z; Wang J; Diao J; Xi L; Pan Y", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.", "journal": "Journal of health, population, and nutrition", "pub_date": "2025-02-17", "doi": "10.1186/s41043-025-00781-x", "score": "7.0", "matched_keywords": "visual analytics(kw); visual(kw,abstract)", "api_keywords": "Cooperation; Infectious Mononucleosis; trends; Visual Analytics; Web Of Science; Bibliometric Analysis"}, {"pmid": "39966622", "title": "The development of an artificial intelligence auto-segmentation tool for 3D volumetric analysis of vestibular schwannomas.", "abstract": "Linear and volumetric analysis are the typical methods to measure tumor size. 3D volumetric analysis has risen in popularity; however, this is very time and labor intensive limiting its implementation in clinical practice. This study aims to show that an AI-led approach can shorten the length of time required to conduct 3D volumetric analysis of VS tumors and improve image processing accuracy. From Yale New Haven Hospital and public patient recruitment, 143 MRIs were included in the ground truth dataset. To create the tumor models for the ground truth dataset, an image processing software (Simpleware ScanIP, Synopsys) was used. The helper (DPP V1.0) was trained using proprietary AI- and ML-based algorithms and information. A proof-of-concept AI model achieved a mean DICE score of 0.76 (standard deviation 0.21). After the final testing stage, the model improved to a final mean DICE score of 0.88 (range 0.74-0.93, standard deviation 0.04). Our study has demonstrated an efficient, accurate AI for 3D volumetric analysis of vestibular schwannomas. The use of this AI will enable faster 3D volumetric analysis compared to manual segmentation. Additionally, the overlay function would allow visualization of growth patterns. The tool will be a method of assessing tumor growth and allow clinicians to make more informed decisions.", "authors": "Jester N; Singh M; Lorr S; Tommasini SM; Wiznia DH; Buono FD", "first_author_affiliation": "School of Medicine, Sheffield University, Sheffield, UK.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "pub_date": "2025-02-18", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-025-88589-x", "score": "6.6", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,title); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Artificial intelligence; Neurofibromatosis; Vestibular Schwannoma; Volumetric Analysis"}, {"pmid": "39983977", "title": "Personalising biologic therapy in psoriasis: Development, validation and user-testing of a precision dosing dashboard.", "abstract": "Rising numbers of individuals receiving psoriasis biologics achieve clear/nearly clear skin (disease control). Trial data indicate some maintain control with lower doses, especially those with higher serum drug concentrations. This indicates potential for Model-Informed Precision Dosing (MIPD), an advanced therapeutic drug monitoring technique, in guiding dose minimisation. We developed, validated, and user-tested a precision dosing dashboard. We applied a MIPD approach leveraging Bayesian estimation to predict individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for personalised dosing recommendations. A PK model of the exemplar biologic risankizumab, derived from phase I-III psoriasis trial data (13123 observations/1899 patients), was externally validated using real-world UK psoriasis data. The Bayesian model (posterior prediction: mean absolute error 0.89 mg/L; mean percentage error 19.55%; root mean square error 1.24 mg/L; R<sup>2</sup> 0.86) had superior predictive power to the basic PK model (prior prediction). The model was incorporated into an interactive dashboard, enabling input of individual patient data (serum drug concentrations, model covariates). UK healthcare professionals rated the dashboard user-friendly and acceptable. Mean time to generate a dosing interval was 2 minutes. Our dashboard has potential to incorporate other biologics and extend across disease contexts (non-response, other inflammatory diseases) for optimal real-world impact of precision dosing on health and cost outcomes.", "authors": "Thomas CM; Baudry D; Arkir Z; Coker B; Dasandi T; Powell K; Arenas-Hernandez M; Leung J; Rawstron K; Nwaogu C; Chapman S; Woolf R; Pink A; Barker J; Standing JF; Smith CH; Mahil SK", "first_author_affiliation": "King's College London, St. John's Institute of Dermatology, London, United Kingdom.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "pub_date": "2025-02-19", "doi": "10.1016/j.jid.2025.01.031", "score": "5.4", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(title,abstract); data(kw,abstract)", "api_keywords": "therapeutic drug monitoring; Immune-mediated Inflammatory Diseases; Model-informed Precision Dosing; Data-driven Dosing"}, {"pmid": "39985669", "title": "GlycoDash: automated, visually assisted curation of glycoproteomics datasets for large sample numbers. ", "abstract": "The challenge of robust and automated glycopeptide quantitation from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data has yet to be adequately addressed by commercial software. Recently, open-source tools like Skyline and LaCyTools have advanced the field of label-free MS1 level quantitation. Yet, important steps late in the data processing workflow remain manual. Because manual data curation is time-consuming and error-prone, it presents a bottleneck, especially in an era of emerging high-throughput methodologies and increasingly complex analyses such as antigen-specific antibody glycosylation. We addressed this gap by developing GlycoDash, an R Shiny-based interactive web application designed to democratize label-free high-throughput glycoproteomics data analysis. The software comes in at a stage where analytes have been identified and quantified, but whole measurement and individual analyte signals of insufficient quality for quantitation remain and reduce the quality of the overall dataset. GlycoDash focuses on these challenges by incorporating several options for measurement and metadata linking, spectral and analyte curation, normalization, and repeatability assessment, and additionally includes glycosylation trait calculation, data visualization, and reporting capabilities that adhere to FAIR principles. The performance and versatility of GlycoDash were demonstrated across antibody glycoproteomics data of increasing complexity, ranging from relatively simple monoclonal antibody glycosylation analysis to a clinical cohort with over a thousand measurements. In a matter of hours, these large, diverse, and complex datasets were curated and explored. High-quality datasets with integrated metadata ready for final analysis and visualization were obtained. Critical aspects of the curation strategy underlying GlycoDash are discussed. GlycoDash effectively automates and streamlines the curation of glycopeptide quantitation data, addressing a critical need for high-throughput glycoproteomics data analysis. Its robust performance across diverse datasets and its comprehensive feature toolbox significantly enhance both research and clinical applications in glycoproteomics.", "authors": "Pongracz T; Gijze S; Hipgrave Ederveen AL; Derks RJE; Falck D", "first_author_affiliation": "Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.", "journal": "Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry", "pub_date": "2025-02-22", "doi": "10.1007/s00216-025-05794-3", "score": "5.4", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(title,abstract)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39963994", "title": "Deconer: An Evaluation Toolkit for Reference-based Deconvolution Methods Using Gene Expression Data.", "abstract": "In recent years, computational methods for quantifying cell type proportions from transcription data have gained significant attention, particularly those reference-based methods which have demonstrated high accuracy.

Historically, the cerebellum was considered a purely motor structure; however, studies since the mid-twentieth century and contributions like the cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome, evidenced its role in emotion. This has led to an expansion of the paradigm, encouraging further research into the cerebellar role in emotion. Understanding this field's development is essential to assessing its current state, identifying knowledge gaps, and exploring emerging areas. This paper analyzes the evolution of scientific production, addressing how scientific interest has changed over time, factors driving growth, dominant topics, leading figures, and collaboration networks. This analysis identifies trends and opportunities, guiding strategies and advancing knowledge through a comprehensive view of the state-of-the-art in this research area. To achieve this, a systematic search was conducted in key databases, identifying 1,162 publications with which an exhaustive quantitative analysis was conducted using bibliometric techniques, network analysis, and visualization tools. The results show exponential growth in the field, evidenced by the increase in publications, researchers, funding sources, and the emergence of new topics. This interest, along with an interdisciplinary approach, has fostered collaboration, with large teams and multicenter projects emerging, although small, isolated teams still predominate. Research mainly focuses on neurological and affective disorders, with a predominance of studies in humans, followed by rodent models. Overall, the analysis reveals a highly interdisciplinary and expanding field.

", "abstract": "DSC perfusion is an advanced imaging technique routinely used at 1.5T and 3T MRI. However, its utility is not well known in 7T MRI systems. We aim to evaluate if DSC perfusion is a valid and practicable tool at 7T MRI. A successful DSC perfusion was performed in 9 patients with an FDA-approved 7T MRI system (Siemens Terra with 1tx/32rx Nova head coil) in 2023. Half-dose contrast was administered by hand, followed by saline flush. Acquisition was initiated 45 seconds before contrast injection. Voxel size was 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1.6 mm3. Perfusion maps were generated by using either SyngoVia or DynaSuite software. Parameters including relative CBV (rCBV), relative CBF (rCBF), relative MTT (rMTT), and relative TTP (rTTP) were measured in 5 anatomic locations bilaterally (precentral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, corona radiata, thalamus, occipital cortex) and enhancing lesions if present. Normalized ratios of rCBV (nrCBV), rCBF (nrCBF), rMTT (nrMTT), and rTTP (nrTTP) were calculated and compared on boxplots. Two neuroradiologists reviewed each scan visually by using a 5-point Likert scale regarding imaging quality and artifacts. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were made on DSC perfusion in cases with enhanced target lesions. Uploading the source images to imaging software took approximately 30\u2009minutes to a few hours. In a few circumstances, large data caused software crashes. Map generation took approximately 10-15\u2009minutes. Susceptibility artifacts varied from mild to moderate in cerebellum, temporal lobes, brainstem, and basal ganglia and none to minimal in the frontal, occipital, and parietal gyri. Map quality was excellent to reasonably good for all cases. The nrCBV, nrCBF, nrMTT, and nrTTP resulted in similar measurements for each anatomic area. Six target lesions were assessed in 2 different patients with well to excellent visualization on fused maps. Three lesions were characterized as tumor progression (1 biopsy-confirmed, 2 unconfirmed), 1 lesion as indeterminant (regressed in follow-up), and 2 lesions as radiation necrosis (1 stable, 1 regressed on follow-up).

We systematically reviewed single-round program performance outcomes using a stepwise approach proposed by the World Endoscopy Organization CRC Screening Committee framework. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Central, and Ichushi Web databases were searched until October 28, 2024, to find RCTs comparing guaiac-based and immunochemical fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT and FIT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), computed tomographic colonography (CTC), and total colonoscopy (TCS). Paired reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed bias risk. A Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis was conducted, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The primary outcome was advanced neoplasia (AN) detection, and the secondary outcomes were participation and colorectal cancer (CRC) detection, all during the first screening round. Eighteen RCTs (437,072 invitees) were included. The risk of bias was low or raised some concerns for screening participation, but it was high for detection outcomes. In the network meta-analysis of 15 RCTs not allowing crossover, the FIT-based program had a higher AN detection rate than the gFOBT-based program (relative risk [RR] 2.48; 95% credible interval [CrI] 1.52-4.21; moderate certainty). AN detection rates were not different in the CTC- (RR 1.01; CrI 0.43-2.23; very low certainty) and TCS-based (RR 1.03; CrI 0.54-1.78; low certainty) programs compared with the FS-based program. All the visualization modality programs had higher AN detection rates than the FIT-based program (FS: RR 2.13 [CrI 1.38-3.77]; CTC 2.16 [1.11-4.51]; and TCS 2.19 [1.43-3.48]; all with low certainty). Low event rates precluded definitive conclusions regarding CRC detection (very low to low certainty). The TCS-based program had the worst participation rate (very low to low certainty). Comparative data allowing crossover were limited. This is the first network meta-analysis that evaluates program-level initial performance indicators. FIT-based programs likely detect more AN cases than gFOBT-based programs, while FS-, CTC-, and TCS-based programs may outperform FIT.

", "abstract": "The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, the resulting reinfections, and post-COVID-19 condition continue to impact many people's lives. Tracking websites like the one at Johns Hopkins University no longer report the daily confirmed cases, posing challenges to accurately determine the true extent of infections. Many COVID-19 cases with mild symptoms are self-assessed at home and reported on social media, which provides an opportunity to monitor and understand the progression and evolving trends of the disease. We aim to build a publicly available database of COVID-19-related tweets and extracted information about symptoms and recovery cycles from self-reported tweets. We have presented the results of our analysis of infection, reinfection, recovery, and long-term effects of COVID-19 on a visualization website that refreshes data on a weekly basis. We used Twitter (subsequently rebranded as X) to collect COVID-19-related data, from which 9 native English-speaking annotators annotated a training dataset of COVID-19-positive self-reporters. We then used large language models to identify positive self-reporters from other unannotated tweets. We used the Hibert transform to calculate the lead of the prediction curve ahead of the reported curve. Finally, we presented our findings on symptoms, recovery, reinfections, and long-term effects of COVID-19 on the Covlab website. We collected 7.3 million tweets related to COVID-19 between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2024, including 262,278 self-reported cases. The predicted number of infection cases by our model is 7.63 days ahead of the official report. In addition to common symptoms, we identified some symptoms that were not included in the list from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as lethargy and hallucinations. Repeat infections were commonly occurring, with rates of second and third infections at 7.49% (19,644/262,278) and 1.37% (3593/262,278), respectively, whereas 0.45% (1180/262,278) also reported that they had been infected >5 times. We identified 723 individuals who shared detailed recovery experiences through tweets, indicating a substantially reduction in recovery time over the years. Specifically, the average recovery period decreased from around 30 days in 2020 to approximately 12 days in 2023.

It is a common condition, affecting 10% of reproductive-age people assigned as female at birth. Although usually occurring in the pelvis, it can rarely involve the thoracic cavity and diaphragm which is termed thoracic endometriosis. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES) refers to four well-recognized clinical entities: catamenial pneumothorax, catamenial hemothorax, catamenial hemoptysis, and lung nodules. However, TES presentation can also be nonspecific, even absent. Optimal management is multidisciplinary, as it depends on patient presentation and lesion characteristics. While initial imaging of thoracic symptoms is with chest radiography and computerized tomography, these modalities have inferior soft tissue contrast resolution and tissue characterization compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially for the detection of both hematic and cystic endometriotic implants. Therefore, a dedicated MRI protocol is essential for diagnosing thoracic endometriosis and aiding surgical planning. Considering the dome-shaped morphology of the diaphragm, sagittal and coronal projections can improve visualization of tiny endometriotic plaques or deposits that are inconspicuous on the axial plane. Breath-hold and respiratory-triggered or navigated techniques are critical for mitigating motion artifacts. T1-weighted fat-suppressed sequences are important for identifying intrinsic T1 hyperintensity and blood products associated with endometriotic lesions.

Methods: Adenovirus serotypes prevalent in the region (Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China) were analyzed by assessing the results of tNGS analysis of respiratory pathogens in children. On this basis, multiple sets of LAMP primers were designed for the adenovirus hexon gene as the detection target. Optimal primer combinations were further screened, and the composition of the reagent system and amplification procedures were improved to achieve efficient amplification. To realize an instrument-independent, fast-testing strategy, by combining NALF, which is based on the principle of lateral chromatography, small molecule antigens were modified for primers. Moreover, amplification products were bound to the corresponding antibodies on nucleic acid chromatography test strips for visualization. Finally, a series of tests were performed to validate the sensitivity, specificity, and methodological consistency of the LAMP-NALF assay. Results: Adenovirus infections in children in this region during this period were mainly caused by serotype 3. The optimal amplification temperature for optimal primers of LAMP was 65 \u00b0C.

For patients with diarrhoea, the DBE's diagnostic rates were 86.8% and 68.4% for DECTE (P\u2009=\u20090.097). The combined diagnostic rate was 94.7%, higher than DECTE alone (\u03c72\u2009=\u20097.092, P\u2009=\u20090.008). For patients with other symptoms, such as abdominal distension or vomiting, the DBE diagnostic rate was 79.4% compared with 61.8% for DECTE (P\u2009=\u20090.183). The combined diagnostic rate was higher than DECTE alone (\u03c72\u2009=\u20096.620, P\u2009=\u20090.010). Furthermore, notable differences in C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, faecal calprotectin, haemoglobin, platelet count, albumin, haematocrit, Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease scores were observed between ulcer-positive and ulcer-negative patients detected by DBE (P\u2009<\u20090.05), whereas DECTE did not show significant differences (P\u2009>\u20090.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>DBE or the combined use of DECTE and DBE provides superior diagnostic performance for small bowel CD, particularly in detecting stenosis and ulcers, compared with DECTE alone. DBE can be used to identify long ulcers and non-ileocecal ulcers. Moreover, DBE helps diagnose small bowel CD across different clinical manifestations and assess disease activity in various inflammatory states.", "authors": "Liu J; Yuan B; Feng Z; Teng Y; Pang X; Luan F; Zhu L; Chen Y", "first_author_affiliation": "The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215000, China.", "journal": "BMC gastroenterology", "pub_date": "2025-02-21", "doi": "10.1186/s12876-025-03695-4", "score": "2.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Crohn\u2019s Disease; Double-balloon Endoscopy; Dual-energy Ct Enterography"}, {"pmid": "39969972", "title": "Digital Solution to Support Medication Adherence and Self-Management in Patients with Cancer (SAMSON): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Medication nonadherence is a serious problem in cancer, potentially impacts patients' health outcomes and health care costs. Although technology-based medication adherence (MA) interventions have emerged, evidence supporting their quality and effectiveness remains limited.<h4>Objective</h4>This study tested the acceptability, feasibility, and potential effects of Safety and Adherence to Medications and Self-care Advice in Oncology (SAMSON), a digital solution designed to support MA and self-management in cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>A 12-week, 2-arm, unblinded, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted. Adults with hematological malignancies who started oral cancer medicines within the last 12 months were recruited from a metropolitan specialized hospital and randomized 1:1 to SAMSON or control (usual care). The SAMSON solution included a smartphone app with tailored alerts and real-time self-care advice, a web-based dashboard for health care professionals (HCPs) to monitor patients' adherence and symptoms, and motivational interviewing (MI) teleconsultations delivered by oncology nurses and pharmacists at baseline and weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. Primary outcomes were the patients' acceptance of SAMSON, measured by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology at 12 weeks, and study feasibility, measured by predefined rates of recruitment, randomization, retention, intervention adherence, and outcome assessment completion. Secondary outcomes were comparison of MA and clinical self-assessments through online questionnaires, including adherence, toxicity self-management, anxiety and depression symptoms, and quality of life, measured at baseline and 12 weeks between the 2 arms. Data retrieved from the SAMSON app (Swinburne University of Technology) was analysed for task completion.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 33 patients (79% of those who were approached) consented to participate in the trial. Of those, 31/33 (94%) completed baseline surveys and were randomized to SAMSON (15/31) and control arms (16/31). Of 31 patients, 28 (90%) completed the 12-week surveys (12 SAMSON and 16 control). Overall, patients rated the SAMSON solution as highly acceptable (13/15, 87% app usage; 14/15, 93% MI teleconsultation delivery). They reported that SAMSON was easy to use (10/12, 83%) and helpful in improving their MA (6/12, 50%). All study HCPs reported the SAMSON solution was helpful in supporting patients' MA. Patients completed an average of 99 tasks over the 12-week study period (71% of scheduled tasks). Most patients (10/12, 83%) completed all 5 scheduled consultations. All study feasibility measures were higher than the predefined upper thresholds, except the rate of patients' responses to medication reminders.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results demonstrated that the SAMSON solution is acceptable, usable, and useful for oncology HCPs and patients with cancer. The SAMSON solution is feasible in real-life oncology settings. Our next steps involve refining the SAMSON solution based on participants' feedback, conducting a large-scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate its clinical and economic effectiveness, and exploring potential commercialization.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12623000472673; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=385728.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>RR2-10.1136/bmjopen-2023-079122.", "authors": "Dang TH; Wickramasinghe N; Jayaraman PP; Burbury K; Alexander M; Whitechurch A; Dyer M; Quinn S; Forkan ARM; Schofield P", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Psychological Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia.", "journal": "JMIR formative research", "pub_date": "2025-02-19", "doi": "10.2196/65302", "score": "2.0", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Cancer; Mobile phone; Quality of life; Oncology; Randomized controlled trial; Patient Safety; Self-management; Rct; Pilot Study; Medication Adherence; Ehealth; Oral Chemotherapy; Mhealth; Mobile Health; Smartphone App; Samson; Digital Solution; Home-based Cancer Treatment"}, {"pmid": "39986004", "title": "Chemical risk assessment in food animals via physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling - Part I: Veterinary drugs on human food safety assessment.

Performing health risk and food safety assessments to derive safety levels of these xenobiotics can protect human health. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a mathematical tool to quantitatively describe chemical disposition in humans and animals informing human food safety and health risk assessments. However, few reviews focus on the application of PBPK models in food animals and discuss their relationship to human food safety and health risk assessments in the last five years (2020-2024). In this series of reviews, we introduce the methodology, recent progress and challenges of PBPK modeling in food animals. The present review is Part I of this series of reviews and it focuses on applications of PBPK models of veterinary drugs in food animals, whereas Part II is a companion review focusing on environmental chemicals. Advanced strategies of PBPK modeling in risk and food safety assessment, including population PBPK, interactive PBPK web dashboard, and generic PBPK are also summarized in Part I. Additionally, we share our perspective on the existing challenges and future direction for PBPK modeling of veterinary medicines in food animals.", "authors": "Mi K; Wu X; Lin Z", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Global Health, College of Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA; Center for Environmental and Human Toxicology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.
