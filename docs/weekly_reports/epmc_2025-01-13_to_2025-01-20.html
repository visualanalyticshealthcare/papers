", "abstract": "Molecular tumor boards (MTBs) play a pivotal role in personalized oncology, leveraging complex data sets to tailor therapy for cancer patients. The integration of digital support and visualization tools is essential in this rapidly evolving field facing fast-growing data and changing clinical processes. This study addresses the gap in understanding the evolution of software and visualization needs within MTBs and evaluates the current state of digital support. Alignment between user requirements and software development is crucial to avoid waste of resources and maintain trust. In two consecutive nationwide medical informatics projects in Germany, surveys and expert interviews were conducted as stage 1 (n\u2009=\u200914), stage 2 (n\u2009=\u200930), and stage 3 (n\u2009=\u20099). Surveys, via the SoSci Survey tool, covered participants' roles, working methods, and support needs. The second survey additionally addressed requirements for visualization solutions in molecular tumor boards. These aimed to understand diverse requirements for preparation, implementation, and documentation. Nine semi-structured expert interviews complemented quantitative findings through open discussion. Using quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that existing digital tools may improve therapy recommendations and streamline MTB case preparation, while continuous training and system improvements are needed. Our study contributes to the field by highlighting the importance of developing user-centric, customizable software solutions that can adapt to the fast-paced environment of MTBs to advance personalized oncology. In doing so, it lays the foundation for further advances in personalized medicine in oncology and points to a shift towards more efficient, technology-driven clinical decision-making processes.

Deep learning segmentation models were trained and selected to\u00a0automatically segment adnexal masses. Radiomics features were extracted utilizing a feature analysis system in Pyradiomics. Feature selection was conducted using the Spearman correlation analysis, Mann-Whitney U-test, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. A nomogram integrating radiomic and clinical features using a machine learning model was established and evaluated. The SHapley Additive exPlanations were used for model interpretability and visualization.<h4>Results</h4>The FCN ResNet101 demonstrated the highest segmentation performance for adnexal masses (Dice similarity coefficient: 89.1%). Support vector machine achieved the best AUC (0.961, 95% CI: 0.925-0.996). The nomogram using the LightGBM algorithm reached the best AUC (0.966, 95% CI: 0.927-1.000).

In the current clinical practice, SLNs are typically marked prior to surgical resection by multiple and sequential injections of two tracers, the radioactive tracer and methylene blue (MB) dye. This imposes physical and psychological burden on patients and medical staff. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotags have emerged as promising SLN tracers due to their high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we propose a novel single-injection composite tracer consisting of SERS nanotags and MB dye solution, to achieve the accurate intraoperative visualization and localization of SLNs. Laser excitation at the second near-infrared window (1064 nm) minimizes the MB fluorescence background interference, allowing the integration of SERS nanotags with MB solution to form the composite tracer, bridging two distinctive but complementary optical modalities. The feasibility of the composite tracer is demonstrated for SLN navigation on rabbit models. For the first time, we successfully visualize and localize multiple SLNs in the axilla of rhesus monkeys. Our study demonstrates the potential of combining MB with SERS nanotags for SLN navigation as the composite tracer, making a significant advancement toward the SLN biopsy in clinical applications.", "authors": "Deng B; Lin LL; Wang Y; Bu X; Li J; Lu J; Wang Y; Chen Y; Ye J", "first_author_affiliation": "Sixth People's Hospital, School of Medicine & School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, P.

", "abstract": "Posterior laminectomy is a standard treatment for thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF), but it often leads to neurological deterioration during surgery. This study aimed to reduce iatrogenic neurological deterioration by using an S8 navigation system combined with an ultrasonic osteotome for three-dimensional real-time dynamic visualization decompression. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent laminectomy and internal fixation for TOLF in our centre from January 2016 to January 2023. Patients were divided into a visualization group (S8 navigation\u2009+\u2009ultrasonic bone scalpel) and a control group (ultrasonic bone scalpel) based on the use of three-dimensional real-time dynamic visualization decompression technology. Intraoperative multimodal neuroelectrophysiological monitoring (IONM) was used to collect somatosensory evoked potential and motor evoked potential data. We compared the incidence of intraoperative neurological deterioration indicated by IONM alarms between the two groups. Neurological and motor functions were assessed via the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification system and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (m-JOA) score for thoracic myelopathy. Follow-ups were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months postsurgery, and the data from both groups were compared. Other clinical indicators included decompression time per laminectomy segment, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative dural ossification, hospitalization duration, and drainage tube placement time. We also analysed intraoperative and postoperative complications. A total of 91 patients with thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum were included, with a follow-up period of 12-18\u00a0months. The visualization group consisted of 41 patients, and the control group included 50 patients. The incidence of neurological deterioration indicated by IONM in the visualization group (9.8%) was significantly lower than that in the control group (30.0%) (P\u2009=\u20090.014). The immediate postoperative ASIA grade change value\u2009\u2264\u2009-\u20091 was lower in the visualization group (9.8%) than in the control group (34.0%) (P\u2009=\u20090.006); A similar trend was observed at the 12\u00a0month follow-up (2.4% vs. 20.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.022). The m-JOA scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months postsurgery were higher in the visualization group than in the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The visualization group also had shorter lamina decompression times per segment and less intraoperative blood loss (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The incidence of nondural ossification cerebrospinal fluid leakage was lower in the visualization group (2.4%) than in the control group (18.0%) (P\u2009=\u20090.018). Additionally, nerve root injury was lower in the visualization group (0%) than in the control group (10.0%) (P\u2009=\u20090.037). Postoperative CT scans revealed no ossification residue in the visualization group, whereas 7 cases (14.0%) were observed in the control group (P\u2009=\u20090.013). The S8 navigation system combined with an ultrasonic osteotome for three-dimensional real-time dynamic visualization decompression significantly reduces the incidence of intraoperative neurological deterioration, improves postoperative motor function recovery, and reduces decompression time per vertebral segment, intraoperative bleeding, and complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

However, there is a conspicuous lack of systematic reviews that thoroughly evaluate both the advantages and drawbacks of integrating 3D with problem-based learning (3D\u2009+\u2009PBL).<h4>Methods</h4>A rigorous search of English databases (Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) and Chinese databases (National Knowledge Infrastructure: CNKI, Chongqing VIP: VIP, and Wan Fang) were performed up to July 2024 to identify relevant studies. Relevant studies were selected based on established eligibility criteria, with clinical data carefully extracted for analysis. Eighteen randomized controlled trials involving a total of 1,077 participants were included in the analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The findings indicated that 3D\u2009+\u2009PBL instruction significantly outperformed traditional lecture-based learning (LBL) in terms of theoretical knowledge (SMD\u2009=\u20091.62, 95% CI: 1.14-2.10, P\u2009<\u20090.00001) and practical operational scores (SMD\u2009=\u20092.29, 95% CI: 1.41-3.16, P\u2009<\u20090.00001). Furthermore, students exposed to 3D\u2009+\u2009PBL teaching exhibited a significantly better understanding of orthopedic anatomical structures compared to those receiving LBL (SMD\u2009=\u20091.18, 95% CI: 0.71-1.65, P\u2009<\u20090.00001). Additionally, students in the 3D\u2009+\u2009PBL group achieved higher theoretical grades (OR\u2009=\u20092.95, 95% CI: 1.57-5.55, P\u2009=\u20090.0008) and reported greater overall satisfaction (OR\u2009=\u20093.26, 95% CI: 1.91-5.54, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) compared to their LBL counterparts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Given the unique demands of orthopedic education, 3D\u2009+\u2009PBL emerges as a highly effective teaching method. It not only improves students' theoretical scores but also enhances their communication skills and comprehension of complex concepts.

Fluorescence imaging with small molecule fluorescent probes has shown great promise for cancer detection but most of the developed probes lack active tumor cell targeting, which makes them unable to selectively target tumors, thereby reducing the accuracy of in vivo tumor detection. Herein, we report a novel probe Bio-S that combines a viscosity-sensitive and cell membrane targetable fluorescent group with biotin for targeted imaging and precise visualization of tumor cells and tumors. Bio-S exhibits sensitive fluorescence changes for viscosity at \u223c660 nm and excellent cell membrane localization and imaging ability (red fluorescence, wash-free, and long-term imaging). Moreover, compared with the nonbiotinylated control probe C6-S, the biotinylated Bio-S can specifically target tumor cell membranes, thereby achieving much higher selectivity and sensitivity in distinguishing tumor cells from normal cells. Mice imaging experiments show that tail vein injection of Bio-S can target tumors and monitor lung cancer metastasis at the in vivo level.

Pyroglutamate aminopeptidase-1 (PGP-1), a potential inflammatory cytokine, has shown considerable potential as a biomarker for tracing the inflammatory process in vivo. However, its exact role in the enhanced visualization of RIRI in complex biological systems has yet to be fully established. Chemiluminescence imaging (CLI) has proven to be one of the most promising diagnostic methods due to its ultrahigh-contrast imaging capabilities compared to fluorescence imaging. In this study, we developed an activatable Schaap's dioxetane chemiluminescent probe (PGP-PD) to explore the potential of PGP-1 as a marker for CLI of renal injury following ischemia-reperfusion, with the goal of achieving high-contrast in situ diagnostics for RIRI. In vitro, PGP-PD exhibited exceptional selectivity for exogenous PGP-1 and remarkable sensitivity, with a detection limit as low as 2.244 ng/mL. Moreover, in vivo studies successfully demonstrated a positive correlation between the RIRI and PGP-1 level. Notably, in situ imaging with PGP-PD generated a significant chemiluminescent signal within the RIRI-kidney, providing an exceptionally high contrast between injured and normal kidney tissue (\u223c9.4-fold) in the RIRI mouse model.

We developed the Atlas of Protein-Protein Interactions in Cancer (APPIC), an interactive webtool that provides PPI subnetworks of 10 cancer types and their subtypes shared by cohorts of patients. To achieve this, we analyzed publicly available RNA sequencing data from patients and identified PPIs specific to 26 distinct cancer subtypes. APPIC compiles biological and clinical information from various databases, including the Human Protein Atlas, Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee, g:Profiler, cBioPortal and Clue.io. The user-friendly interface allows for both 2D and 3D PPI network visualizations, enhancing the usability and interpretability of complex data.

Up to 70% of AMEs are not reported to, and hence remain undetected by, health care professionals and only 6% of AMEs are reported to regulators. Increased reporting by consumers, health care professionals, and pharmaceutical companies to medicine regulatory authorities is needed to increase the safety of medicines.<h4>Objective</h4>We describe a project that aims to co-design a digital reporting platform to improve detection and management of AMEs by consumers and health care professionals and improve reporting to regulators.<h4>Methods</h4>The project will be conducted in 3 phases and uses a co-design methodology that prioritizes equity in designing with stakeholders. Our project is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. In phase 1, we will engage with 3 stakeholder groups-consumers, health care professionals, and regulators-to define digital platform development standards. We will conduct a series of individual interviews, focus group discussions, and co-design workshops with the stakeholder groups. In phase 2, we will work with a software developer and user interaction design experts to prototype, test, and develop the digital reporting platform based on findings from phase 1. In phase 3, we will implement and trial the digital reporting platform in South Australia through general practices and pharmacies. Consumers who have recently started using medicines new to them will be recruited to use the digital reporting platform to report any apparent, suspected, or possible AMEs since starting the new medicine. Process and outcome evaluations will be conducted to assess the implementation process and to determine whether the new platform has increased AME detection and reporting.<h4>Results</h4>This project, initiated in 2023, will run until 2026. Phase 1 will result in persona profiles and user journey maps that define the standards for the user-friendly platform and interactive data visualization tool or dashboard that will be developed and further improved in phase 2. Finally, phase 3 will provide insights of the implemented platform regarding its impact on AME detection, management, and reporting. Findings will be published progressively as we complete the different phases of the project.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This project adopts a co-design methodology to develop a new digital reporting platform for AME detection and reporting, considering the perspectives and lived experience of stakeholders and addressing their requirements throughout the entire process. The overarching goal of the project is to leverage the potential of both consumers and technology to address the existing challenges of underdetection and underreporting of AMEs to health care professionals and regulators. The project potentially will improve individual patient safety and generate new data for regulatory purposes related to medicine safety and effectiveness.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/60084.", "authors": "Gebreyohannes EA; Thornton C; Thiessen M; de Vries ST; Q Andrade A; Kalisch Ellett L; Frank O; Cheah PY; Choo KR; Laba TL; Roughead EE; Hwang I; Moses G; Lim R", "first_author_affiliation": "Quality Use of Medicines and Pharmacy Research Centre, UniSA Clinical and Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.", "journal": "JMIR research protocols", "pub_date": "2025-01-15", "doi": "10.2196/60084", "score": "4.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Pharmacovigilance; Adverse Drug Events; Medication Safety; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Digital Health; Co-design; Drug-related Side Effects And Adverse Reactions; Qualitative Research, User-centered Design"}, {"pmid": "39819197", "title": "Cluster analysis of social determinants of health and HIV/AIDS knowledge among Peruvian youths using Kohonen's self-organized maps: a data-exploration study based on a Demographic and health survey.

Epidemiological studies employing unsupervised learning techniques are essential for shaping public health policies. This study aimed to describe the Peruvian youth population based on their sociodemographic, health, and economic characteristics using an unsupervised learning approach through the development of a neural network model based on Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOMs), allowing the identification of social profiles in the study population. This quantitative study used data from the 2019 Peruvian Demographic and Family Health Survey. An SOM network model for clustering individuals with similar attributes and clustering prototype vectors based on the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) method and their visualization on an SOM was applied to the study sample. Clustering of prototype vectors yielded four clusters, each of which represented a profile of Peruvian youths based on their knowledge of HIV/AIDS and structural health determinants. Kohonen's neural networks allowed the identification of patterns and behaviors among youths in Peru, quantifying and characterizing the four social clusters regarding HIV/AIDS and their social determinants. Kohonen's maps may benefit healthcare professionals and policymakers by offering a useful method for tailoring interventions and policies based on the detected profiles, thereby enhancing the visibility of these focal points at the national level.", "authors": "Aybar-Flores A; Talavera A; Espinoza-Portilla E", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Engineering, Universidad del Pacifico, Lima, Peru.", "journal": "Global health action", "pub_date": "2025-01-17", "doi": "10.1080/16549716.2024.2438070", "score": "3.8", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39812924", "title": "Differences in technical and clinical perspectives on AI validation in cancer imaging: mind the gap!", "abstract": "Good practices in artificial intelligence (AI) model validation are key for achieving trustworthy AI. Within the cancer imaging domain, attracting the attention of clinical and technical AI enthusiasts, this work discusses current gaps in AI validation strategies, examining existing practices that are common or variable across technical groups (TGs) and clinical groups (CGs). The work is based on a set of structured questions encompassing several AI validation topics, addressed to professionals working in AI for medical imaging. A total of 49 responses were obtained and analysed to identify trends and patterns. While TGs valued transparency and traceability the most, CGs pointed out the importance of explainability. Among the topics where TGs may benefit from further exposure are stability and robustness checks, and mitigation of fairness issues. On the other hand, CGs seemed more reluctant towards synthetic data for validation and would benefit from exposure to cross-validation techniques, or segmentation metrics. Topics emerging from the open questions were utility, capability, adoption and trustworthiness. These findings on current trends in AI validation strategies may guide the creation of guidelines necessary for training the next generation of professionals working with AI in healthcare and contribute to bridging any technical-clinical gap in AI validation. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This study recognised current gaps in understanding and applying AI validation strategies in cancer imaging and helped promote trust and adoption for interdisciplinary teams of technical and clinical researchers.

Respect for the posterior blood supply, open physes, and need for direct visualization to achieve anatomic reduction are critical considerations in surgical fixation. This study presents a case series and a surgical approach used in treating these patients.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective review of patients aged 10-19 presenting to a single quaternary-care academic center from 2016 to 2023 with isolated capitellar and trochlear shear fractures was performed. Demographic data, injury mechanism, fracture classification, and surgical approach were recorded. Outcomes included elbow range of motion at the final follow-up, visual analogue scale pain scores, pediatric Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales, radiographic and clinical union, return to sport, and postoperative complications.<h4>Results</h4>Eight patients were included, four of whom were treated through a single-incision anterolateral approach. Average age was 13 years. Average time of the final clinical follow-up was 21 months, with a radiographic follow-up of 11 months. Five fractures were classified as Dubberly type 2A, two as type 3A, and one as type 3B. At the final follow-up, average elbow range of motion and visual analogue scale pain scores were 3-137 degrees and 0.28 (range: 0-2), respectively. PROMIS scores demonstrated an average mobility score of 55 (SD: 8), pain interference of 35 (SD: 5), and pediatric upper-extremity score of 55 (SD: 4). One patient with sickle cell disease developed avascular necrosis of the capitellum. There were no other postoperative complications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Short-term clinical outcomes reveal low pain scores, near normal elbow motion, radiographic and clinical union, and normal patient-reported outcome measures in operatively treated coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus in adolescent patients. A single-incision anterolateral approach offers visualization of the anterior articular surface while respecting posterior soft tissues and the olecranon apophysis.<h4>Type of study/level of evidence</h4>Therapeutic V, case series.", "authors": "Wright D; Meyer Z; Goldfarb CA; Wall LB", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery", "pub_date": "2025-01-15", "doi": "10.1016/j.jhsa.2024.11.016", "score": "3.0", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Adolescent; Outcome; Distal Humerus; Coronal Shear"}, {"pmid": "39821461", "title": "Smartphone application-based augmented reality for pre-clinical dental implant placement training: a pilot study.

Despite the promising results of this technology in the past two decades, there is still insufficient data about its advantages and limits, as well as the implementation in routine clinical practice and the learning curve for the user. The purpose of this prospective cohort-based study is to evaluate the performance of a 5G-based tele-robotic US system for abdominal and thyroid gland assessment in a cohort of healthy volunteers and outpatients, as well as assessing the learning curve and patient satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>64 participants (23 male, 41 female) were consecutively included during the recruitment period, for a total of 51 abdominal and 37 thyroid gland US studies. The mean age was 45.23\u2009\u00b1\u200918.90\u00a0years old, and the body mass index of the abdominal cohort was 22.97\u2009\u00b1\u20092.95\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The learning curve estimated a minimum of 20 patients for abdominal tele-robotic US training, being almost non-existent in the thyroid gland cohort. All the variables showed no-statistical differences between standard US and tele-robotic US in the abdominal post-trained cohort except the visualization of the left kidney short axis and its interpolar length. Thyroid gland variables showed no statistical differences.

This study aims to investigate key biomarkers of glioma-related hemorrhage to provide insights into glioma molecular therapies. Data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in glioma by contrasting glioblastoma (GBM) with low-grade gliomas (LGGs). We conducted enrichment analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) databases through the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). A STRING-based protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was developed to identify hub genes, which were subsequently analyzed for their functions in the GeneCards database. To identify angiogenesis-associated genes, we utilized the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. A clinical pathological study was conducted using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to confirm the findings. In the GEO database, the GEO Series Experiments GSE26576 and GSE184941 included 4523 and 1471 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. We identified 2715 DEGs using the cBioPortal within the TCGA database. A Venn diagram identified 39 common DEGs. The KEGG pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis highlighted functions related to angiogenesis. PPI network analyses pinpointed 13 hub genes. Through cross-referencing a gene set related to tumor angiogenesis in the GeneCards database, we identified MMP-2 and EGFR as key genes. In the HPA database, we observed EGFR and MMP-2 expression in the normal cerebral cortex, confirmed by IHC. In GEPIA database, high MMP-2 levels were associated with decreased survival time, while EGFR expression showed no significant differences in survival. A clinical study of 21 patients, 11 in the control group and 10 in the stroke group with glioma hemorrhage, revealed no significant differences in their characteristics or comorbidities. IDH1 positivity was higher in the control group (4/11) vs the stroke group (0/10). Tumor cells exhibited increased MMP-2 and EGFR expression, with stronger staining in the stroke group.

Reconstructions for each examination included a reference reconstruction (reflecting clinical protocols) using a 0.8-mm slice thickness and Bv40 kernel and six UHR reconstructions using a 0.2-mm slice thickness and kernels of varying sharpness (Bv48-Bv80). Quantitative measures were recorded. Two radiologists independently evaluated qualitative measures using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (lowest quality) to 5 (highest quality). <b>RESULTS.</b> The analysis included 103 participants (mean age, 61.3 \u00b1 13.0 [SD] years; 56 men, 47 women). Median vessel sharpness (in Hounsfield units per millimeter) was 100.9 HU/mm for the reference reconstruction, and for the UHR reconstructions, it varied from 110.0 HU/mm for Bv48 to 121.6 HU/mm for Bv76 and 134.7 HU/mm for Bv80. Median right internal carotid artery C2 luminal diameter was 3.8 mm for the reference reconstruction, and for the UHR reconstructions, it increased from 4.1 mm for Bv48 to 4.9 mm for Bv80. For both readers, median overall image quality for the reference reconstruction was 3, and for the UHR reconstructions, it was highest for Bv64 (score of 5); calcified-plaque blooming artifact for the reference reconstruction was 1, and for the UHR reconstructions, it was highest for Bv72 (score of 5) and Bv76 (score of 5); stent blooming artifact for the reference reconstruction was 1, and for the UHR reconstructions, it was highest for Bv76 (score of 5) and Bv80 (score of 5); soft-plaque delineation for the reference reconstruction was 1, and for the UHR reconstructions, it was highest for Bv76 (score of 5) or Bv80 (score of 5); small-vessel visualization for the reference reconstruction was 1, and for the UHR reconstructions, it was highest for Bv76 (score of 5) or Bv80 (score of 5). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> UHR PCD CTA yielded reduced blooming artifact from calcified plaques or stents and improved visualization of soft plaque and small vessels. These advantages were more pronounced for strongest kernels, although subjective image quality was better for a weaker kernel. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> The findings indicate benefits from the use of UHR PCD CTA for head and neck evaluation and may help guide such examinations' kernel selection.", "authors": "He N; Zhang Y; Li Z; Xu Z; Lyu H; Li J; Dong H; Zhu C; Haacke EM; Mossa-Basha M; Schmidt B; Jiang H; Yan F", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No. 197 Ruijin Er Rd, Shanghai, 200025, China.", "journal": "AJR.

Traditional diagnostic and treatment methods, including laparoscopic surgery and hormonal therapy, face significant limitations such as incomplete lesion detection, high recurrence rates, and adverse side effects. Emerging bioengineering technologies offer promising solutions for precise diagnosis and therapy of these diseases. Advances in biomarker detection through electrochemical immunosensors, including specific molecular markers like cytokines and growth factors, have improved their early diagnosis. Innovative imaging techniques, such as near-infrared fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and photoacoustic imaging, enhance lesion visualization and surgical precision. In therapeutic applications, bioengineered drug delivery systems enable targeted therapy by modifying drug carriers with ligands targeting highly expressed receptors in endometriotic lesions. Such strategies could improve drug accumulation at target sites and reduce damage to healthy tissues. Integrating external energy (including lasers, focused ultrasound, and magnetic fields) with nanoplatforms offers key benefits for treating endometriosis and adenomyosis, allowing precise delivery of energy-responsive molecules to lesions and minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Additionally, novel approaches, such as immunotherapy, gene therapy, ferroptosis induction, and synthetic lethal activation, offer new avenues for effective treatment of endometriosis and adenomyosis. Significantly, this paper discusses the advantages of precision diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis in preserving the fertility of women of reproductive age.

Although these are not diagnostic criteria, they may increase dependence risk and complicate treatment. This study aims to analyze comorbidities and their complex relationships in AUD patients through epidemiological surveys and network analysis.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Using multi-stage stratified cluster random sampling, we selected 27,913 individuals and identified those with AUD for the study. All screened subjects were assessed with the General Health Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Simple Coping Style Questionnaire, and diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Network analysis and visualization were performed in R 4.4.0. The <i>qgraph</i> and <i>bootnet</i> packages in R were used to obtain partial correlation network analysis and node centrality of mental health, sleep quality, and coping styles in individuals with AUD through the <i>estimateNetwork</i> function. The <i>bootnet</i> package was used to assess the accuracy and stability of the network. The <i>bnlearn</i> package in R was used to construct directed acyclic graph (DAG) for individuals with AUD using the Bayesian hill-climbing algorithm.<h4>Results</h4>In the partial correlation network, among the three major comorbidity categories, 'anxiety/depression' was most strongly associated with 'sleep quality'. 'Anxiety/depression' and 'sleep quality' had the highest node centrality, with 'sleep latency' also showing notable centrality. The DAG results indicated that 'sleep latency' had the highest probability priority, directly affecting 'anxiety/depression' and key sleep quality symptoms such as 'subjective sleep quality', 'sleep disturbances', 'sleep duration', and 'sleep efficiency', while also indirectly influencing other symptoms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Among the comorbid symptoms of AUD, sleep latency appears to be a key factor in triggering other comorbid symptoms.

Narrow band imaging (NBI) may assist in the visualization of abnormal mucosa, but its role in sarcoidosis remains to be characterized. Individuals referred for suspected sarcoidosis were considered for enrollment. Bronchoscopy with both WL and NBI was conducted, followed by EBB. The main objectives were to characterize NBI abnormalities in this patient population and determine the incremental yield of NBI-directed EBB. In our cohort of 100 suspected sarcoidosis patients (66% male, median age 42), 88 were diagnosed with sarcoidosis, through cytopathology (n=78) or clinical evaluation (n=10). NBI high-grade lesions were more common than WL high-grade lesions (58% vs. 27%, difference 31%, 95% CI 18.3-42.5% P<0.001). High-grade WL EBB were more likely to be positive than low-grade WL biopsies [20/31 (65%) vs. 20/91 (22%), odds ratio (OR) 6.5, 95% CI 2.7-15.6, P<0.01]).

EBB positivity and false-negative EBUS-TBNA were more common in patients with Scadding stage 2 or greater, suggesting that the chest radiography stage may help select patients more likely to benefit from adjunctive EBB.

One mechanism of initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF) is stimulation from EGF-identified focal sources that serve as driver sites of fibrillatory conduction. Electrographic flow consistency (EGFC) further quantifies the concordance of observed wavefront patterns, indicating that a healthier substrate shows more organized wavefront propagation and higher EGFC. Freedom from AF (FFAF) recurrence has accordingly been shown to be higher in patients with ablated vs. unablated sources and with high vs. low EGFC.<h4>Objectives</h4>(1) Measure FFAF across EGF-derived phenotypes in patients enrolled in the AF-FLOW Global Registry; (2) determine if a relationship exists between EGFC and percentage of healthy voltage as measured from bipolar voltage maps.<h4>Methods</h4>The AF-FLOW Global Registry is a multicenter, prospective study of 25 all-comer AF patients who underwent concomitant high-density bipolar voltage mapping with a 16-electrode grid mapping catheter and EGF mapping with a 64-pole basket catheter. The EGF algorithm detects extra-pulmonary vein sources as origins of excitation from a singularity of divergent flow vectors and was used to localize RF ablation targets. Overall, EGFC per atrium was also computed as the average of the modulus of individual EGF vectors, where the vector length represents the consistency of flow patterns. Patients were then assigned phenotypes on the basis of source presence or absence and EGFC, and rates of FFAF at 1-year were compared across the four resulting phenotypes. Atrial EGFC was also compared to the percentage of healthy tissue determined by bipolar voltage mapping.<h4>Results</h4>Patients with paroxysmal AF had higher FFAF than persistent AF (PeAF) and long-standing PeAF patients; patients receiving de novo ablation had higher FFAF than those receiving redo ablation. Patient phenotyping revealed that those with high EGFC had higher FFAF than those with low EGFC (p\u2009=\u20090.015). Atrial EGFC was also correlated to the percent of high voltage tissue across all patients (r\u2009=\u20090.651, p\u2009<\u20090.0001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>EGF mapping provides insights into the mechanistic nature of AF and the atrial health of the underlying substrate.

However, for possible slipping of the cement below the mucosal margin, its thorough removal poses some issues. The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of submucosal cement residues in patients with peri-implant disease by endoscopic visualization and to investigate the potential correlation between the pathological scenario and the spatial position of cement residues.<h4>Methods</h4>The study sample comprised 46 consecutive patients exhibiting clinical and radiographic signs of peri-implant disease around cement-retained crowns. When at first visit bleeding on probing was the only pathological sign, the area was debrided and then treated with antiseptic agents for 30 days. Only those patients for whom bleeding was still found at re-evaluation were included in the study. All implants were therefore endoscopically evaluated to identify possible submucosal cement residues. For all implants showing residual cement, the spatial position of the residual cement was recorded with respect to predefined points.<h4>Results</h4>Cement residues were detected in 80.4% of the patients and were predominantly located in the vestibular and lingual areas (88%). Analysis of the distances between the apical portion of the residues and anatomical landmarks revealed significant differences between mucositis and peri-implantitis patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In cases of peri-implantitis, the cement residue was more apically located than in mucositis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The presence of cement residue was associated with peri-implant disorders in the majority of patients. A potential correlation between the position of residues and the peri-implant disease scenario is here suggested.<h4>Plain language summary</h4>A common method for fixing the crown on the dental implant is the use of specific cements. However, these products can slip below the gum line resulting in difficulties in their removal, which could cause peri-implant disease. This study aimed to evaluate the presence and location of residual cement hidden under the gums in patients with peri-implant disease, characterized by symptoms such as bleeding gums and, in some cases, bone loss around the dental implant. Using a small fiber-optic camera (endoscope), 46 patients were examined for any cement residue under the gums. The study showed that more than 80% of patients had cement residues, especially in the areas facing the cheeks and tongue. It was also found that in patients with a more severe form of inflammation (peri-implantitis), the cement was placed deeper than in those with a milder form (mucositis). This confirms that residual cement is common in patients with peri-implant disease, but also suggests that its location could influence the severity of the pathological manifestation. This finding highlights the importance of carefully removing all cement to prevent such complications.", "authors": "Montevecchi M; Valeriani L; Salvadori MF; Stefanini M; Zucchelli G", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, School of Dentistry - Division of Periodontology and Implantology, Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.", "journal": "Journal of periodontology", "pub_date": "2025-01-15", "doi": "10.1002/jper.24-0510", "score": "2.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Risk factor; Endoscopy; Dental Implants; Implant Prosthesis; Excess Cement; Peri\u2010implant Disease"}, {"pmid": "39817382", "title": "Poly Lactic Co-glycolic Acid d-\u03b1-tocopheryl Polyethylene Glycol 1000 Succinate Fabricated Polyethylene Glycol Hybrid Nanoparticles of Imatinib Mesylate for the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme.", "abstract": "<h4>Aims</h4>This study aimed to develop Imatinib Mesylate (IMT)-loaded Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA)-D-\u03b1-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS)- Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hybrid nanoparticles (CSLHNPs) with optimized physicochemical properties for targeted delivery to glioblastoma multiforme.<h4>Background</h4>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most destructive type of brain tumor with several complications. Currently, most treatments for drug delivery for this disease face challenges due to the poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) and lack of site-specific delivery. Imatinib Mesylate (IMT) is one of the most effective drugs for GBM, but its primary issue is low bioavailability. Therefore, nanotechnology presents a promising solution for targeted IMT delivery to GBM. This article primarily explores the fabrication of IMT-loaded core-shell lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (CSLHNPs) to achieve enhanced brain delivery with therapeutic efficacy.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary objective of this study is to develop optimized, stable IMT-loaded hybrid nanoparticles with an encapsulated polymer matrix and to evaluate these nanoparticles using sophisticated instruments such as SEM and TEM to achieve smooth, spherical nanoparticles in a monodispersed phase.<h4>Method</h4>The enhanced stable formulation yielded a notable increase in entrapment efficiency, reaching 58.89 \u00b1 0.5%. The physical stability analysis of nanoparticles was assessed over 30 days under conditions of 25 \u00b1 2\u00b0C and 60 \u00b1 5% relative humidity. Hemolytic assays affirmed the biocompatibility and safety profile of the nanoparticles. in vitro drug release kinetics revealed a sustained IMT release over 48 hours.<h4>Results</h4>The formulated CSLHNPs achieved a narrow size distribution with a mean vesicle diameter of 155.03 \u00b1 2.41 nm and a low polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.23 \u00b1 0.4, indicating monodispersity. A high negative zeta potential of -23.89 \u00b1 3.47 mV ensured excellent colloidal stability in physiological conditions. XRD analysis confirmed the successful encapsulation of IMT within the nanoparticle matrix, with the drug transitioning to an amorphous state for enhanced dissolution. During Cell-Cell viability assays on LN229, glioblastoma cells were treated with IMT-loaded nanoparticles and showed a significantly enhanced inhibitory effect compared to free IMT. These hybrid nanoparticles demonstrated potential in reducing oxidative stress-induced cellular damage by mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, the prepared IMT hybrid nanoparticles showed higher cellular uptake and superior cytotoxicity compared to the plain drug.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study posits the IMT-PLGA-TPGS-DSPE PEG 2000-CSPLHNPs as a formidable and innovative drug delivery system for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) treatment, warranting further exploration into their clinical application potential. Future work could involve conducting in vivo studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and therapeutic efficacy of the IMT-PLGA-TPGS-DSPE PEG 2000-CSPLHNPs in animal models of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Additionally, further research may focus on optimizing the nanoparticle formulation for enhanced targeting capabilities, investigating long-term stability under varied storage conditions, exploring potential combination therapies to synergize with the nanoparticles, and assessing the scalability and manufacturability of the developed drug delivery system for potential clinical translation.
