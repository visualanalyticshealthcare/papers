", "abstract": "The translation of bedside experience to pedagogical content presents a unique challenge for the field of bioethics. The contributions are multidisciplinary, the practices are heterogeneous, and the work product is characteristically nuanced. While academic bioethics education programs have proliferated, developing content and pedagogy sufficient to teach clinical ethics effectively remains a longstanding challenge. The authors identify three reasons why progress towards this goal has been slow. First, there is a lack of robust, empirical knowledge for education focused on praxis. Second, the methods employed in academic education tend to focus on traditional didactic approaches rather than engendering competency through interaction and practice-the principle means by which clinical ethicists work. Third, the data practitioners have captured has not been presented in a medium educators and students can most meaningfully interact with.In this paper, the authors describe a novel pedagogical tool: the Armstrong Clinical Ethics Coding System (ACECS) and interactive visual analytics dashboard. Together, these components comprise an educational platform that utilizes the empirical data collected by the institution's ethics service. The tool offers four advantages. First, it aids with the identification of ethical issues that present during a consultation at that specific institution or medical unit by making use of a lingua franca comprehensible to both ethicists and non-ethicists. Second, content is centered on issue frequency, type, and relation to other issues. Iterating through cases, requestors, or hospital units allows one to understand cases typologically and through metanarratives that reveal relationships and subtle patterns. Third, the use of interactive data visualizations and data storytelling aids comprehension and retention. Fourth, the process of using the system necessitates understanding the manifold ways each case can be understood, accommodating a wide range of perspectives and ethical lenses, enhancing case analysis and self-reflection conducive to life-long learning.", "authors": "Teti SL; Armstrong K", "first_author_affiliation": "Center for Clinical and Organizational Ethics, Inova Health System, Falls Church, VA, USA.", "journal": "Cambridge quarterly of healthcare ethics : CQ : the international journal of healthcare ethics committees", "pub_date": "2025-02-06", "doi": "10.1017/s0963180124000732", "score": "13.7", "matched_keywords": "visual analytics(title,abstract); visualization(abstract); dashboard(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39920429", "title": "The Impact of an Enhanced Data Visualization Tool for Hypertension in the Electronic Health Record on Physician Judgments About Hypertension Control.

This study assessed the impact of variations in patterns of blood pressure data on physician perceptions of hypertension control using different forms of data visualization. Physicians (N\u2009=\u200957) reviewed eight brief vignettes describing a fictitious patient; each vignette included a graph of the patient's blood pressure data. We examined how variations in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), blood pressure standard deviation (SD), and form of visualization (e.g., line graph with raw values or smoothed values only) affected judgments about hypertension control and need for medication change. Smoothing successfully reduced visual noise for the physicians. For controlled hypertension, physician judgments were more consistent with clinical guidelines when using the smoothed graph compared with the raw data graph. Judgments about hypertension control with the smoothed graph were similar to judgments made using the raw data graph for cases of uncontrolled hypertension. Data visualization can direct physicians to attend to more clinically meaningful information, thereby improving their judgments of hypertension control.", "authors": "Shaffer VA; Wegier P; Valentine KD; Duan S; Canfield SM; Belden JL; Steege LM; Popescu M; Koopman RJ", "first_author_affiliation": "University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA. shafferv@missouri.edu.", "journal": "Journal of general internal medicine", "pub_date": "2025-02-07", "doi": "10.1007/s11606-025-09381-1", "score": "10.2", "matched_keywords": "visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(title,abstract); electronic health record(title)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39900784", "title": "Prediction of the Risk of Adverse Clinical Outcomes with Machine Learning Techniques in Patients with Noncommunicable Diseases.", "abstract": "Decision-making in chronic diseases guided by clinical decision support systems that use models including multiple variables based on artificial intelligence requires scientific validation in different populations to optimize the use of limited human, financial, and clinical resources in healthcare systems worldwide. This cohort study evaluated three machine learning algorithms-XGBoost, Elastic Net logistic regression, and an Artificial Neural Network-to develop a prediction model for three outcomes: mortality, hospitalization, and emergency department visits. The objective was to build a clinical decision support system for patients with noncommunicable diseases treated at the Alma Mater Hospital complex in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. We collected 4845 electronic medical record entries from 5000 patients included in the study. The median age was 71.83 years, with 63.8% women and 29.7% receiving home care. The most prevalent medical conditions were diabetes (52.9%), hypertension (67.2%), dyslipidemia (57.3%), and COPD (19.4%).

This study details the development of a data-driven early warning system (EWS) designed to improve outbreak detection and response utilizing the data integration and visualization capabilities of Microsoft Power BI.<h4>Methods</h4>This research utilized a structured three-phase approach to design a respiratory infections (RIs) management dashboard. Phase 1, focused on identifying critical variables through literature reviews and expert interviews. In Phase 2, Microsoft Power BI was employed for dashboard development, integrating data from diverse sources. Phase 3 involved usability testing with health professionals who evaluated navigation, data accuracy, decision-support features, providing feedback to enhance visualization clarity and filtering capabilities.<h4>Results</h4>Key data categories include individual-level variables, such as age, symptoms, and vaccination records, alongside population-level metrics like infection rates and regional vaccination coverage enabling functionalities such as identifying high-risk individuals, tracking infection dynamics, and optimizing resource allocation. The dashboard, developed using Power BI visualizes epidemiological trends, intervention outcomes, and resource utilization. A relational database schema ensures efficient data retrieval, facilitating comprehensive analysis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prototype EWS represents a scalable and integrative framework aimed at enhancing public health applications, particularly in the context of respiratory infections. By incorporating data from diverse health sectors, the system offers decision-makers access to critical epidemiological indicators, supporting early outbreak detection and improved epidemic management. Its potential to unify health institutions underscores its value in fostering a more cohesive and effective approach to epidemic preparedness.

Artificial intelligence (AI) stands out, offering unprecedented capabilities in data analysis, diagnostic support, and personalized medicine. However, effectively integrating AI into health care necessitates specialized competencies among professionals, an area still in its infancy in terms of comprehensive literature and formalized training programs.<h4>Objective</h4>This systematic review aims to consolidate the essential skills and knowledge health care professionals need to integrate AI into their clinical practice effectively, according to the published literature.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic review, across databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, of peer-reviewed literature that directly explored the required skills for health care professionals to integrate AI into their practice, published in English or Spanish from 2018 onward. Studies that did not refer to specific skills or training in digital health were not included, discarding those that did not directly contribute to understanding the competencies necessary to integrate AI into health care practice. Bias in the examined works was evaluated following Cochrane's domain-based recommendations.<h4>Results</h4>The initial database search yielded a total of 2457 articles. After deleting duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 37 articles were selected for full-text review. Out of these, only 7 met all the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The review identified a diverse range of skills and competencies, that we categorized into 14 key areas classified based on their frequency of appearance in the selected studies, including AI fundamentals, data analytics and management, and ethical considerations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the broadening of search criteria to capture the evolving nature of AI in health care, the review underscores a significant gap in focused studies on the required competencies. Moreover, the review highlights the critical role of regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration in facilitating the adoption of AI technologies by establishing trust and standardizing algorithms. Key areas were identified for developing competencies among health care professionals for the implementation of AI, including: AI fundamentals knowledge (more focused on assessing the accuracy, reliability, and validity of AI algorithms than on more technical abilities such as programming or mathematics), data analysis skills (including data acquisition, cleaning, visualization, management, and governance), and ethical and legal considerations. In an AI-enhanced health care landscape, the ability to humanize patient care through effective communication is paramount. This balance ensures that while AI streamlines tasks and potentially increases patient interaction time, health care professionals maintain a focus on compassionate care, thereby leveraging AI to enhance, rather than detract from, the patient experience.\u2003.", "authors": "Gazquez-Garcia J; S\u00e1nchez-Bocanegra CL; Sevillano JL", "first_author_affiliation": "Servicio Andaluz de Salud, Distrito Sanitario Almeria, Almeria, Spain.", "journal": "JMIR medical education", "pub_date": "2025-02-05", "doi": "10.2196/58161", "score": "6.0", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Artificial intelligence; Systematic review; Healthcare Education; Healthcare Competencies; Ai Regulation"}, {"pmid": "39919521", "title": "A framework to integrate equity in public health emergency response dashboards: Dashboard instrument to review equity (DIRE).

Three levels of thematic analysis were completed. Tool development consisted of building a conceptual model on the DIKW Pyramid and Informatics Stack. Then the review's five themes were integrated into DIRE. The review closed at a final count of 102 articles, with five themes emerging: COVID-19 impact, Health Equity, Decisions During Emergencies, Dashboards and Decision Support, and Frameworks. COVID-19 dashboards were also reviewed. DIRE was designed into three layers (context, data flow, and dashboard users) and three data flow buckets (data sources, DIK pillars, and interventions). This study aimed to (1) Establish a research foundation of health equity, COVID-19 lessons learned, and decision support, and (2) Develop an evidence-based framework.

The aim of oregis is to provide a comprehensive picture of the current healthcare situation and promote healthcare research using real-world-data from inpatient and outpatient facilities. Since its launch in 2020, oregis has continuously expanded its database to enable scientific analyses on a wide range of topics. This paper presents the new dashboard feature allowing participating centres to compare their own patient data with aggregated data in real time while also covering privacy aspects of the system.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The oregis steering committee opted to implement the oregis dashboard based on existing medical registries. First, forty-nine national and international registries were analysed to identify common features such as benchmarking functionality. This was followed by technical realisation and implementation.<h4>Results</h4>Each centre connected to oregis has secure access to the oregis dashboard, which displays key indicators for patients, diagnoses, and treatments. Dynamic filtering options allow targeted data analysis, comparing each centre's results anonymously with aggregated data from other centres. The dashboard uses Apache Superset data visualisation software [! etwas informativer]. Data is synchronised using an integrated oregis Konnektor module to anonymise patient data according to defined standards. Extensive security and privacy measures ensure data security, including server-side encryption, transport encryption, and two-factor authentication. The dashboard is part of a comprehensive privacy policy developed and validated for oregis by privacy experts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The number of centres connected to oregis is still growing. The new web-based dashboard allows flexible analysis of data and comparison with other centres without allowing conclusions to be drawn about any individual care centre; this ensures data privacy and independence in each centre. More features can be added to provide a more thorough overview of eye care in Germany as oregis grows.", "authors": "Zimmermann JA; Dicke C; Arndt M; Hollosi NA; Storp JJ; Eter N", "first_author_affiliation": "Klinik f\u00fcr Augenheilkunde, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum M\u00fcnster, Deutschland.", "journal": "Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde", "pub_date": "2025-02-04", "doi": "10.1055/a-2481-2044", "score": "5.4", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(title,abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": ""}, {"pmid": "39899838", "title": "Effectiveness of Electronic Quality Improvement Activities to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk in People With Chronic Kidney Disease in General Practice: Cluster Randomized Trial With Active Control.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Future Health Today (FHT) is a program integrated with electronic medical record (EMR) systems in general practice and comprises (1) a practice dashboard to identify people at risk of, or with, chronic disease who may benefit from intervention; (2) active clinical decision support (CDS) at the point of care; and (3) quality improvement activities. One module within FHT aims to facilitate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) through the recommendation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), or statins according to Australian guidelines (defined as appropriate pharmacological therapy).<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to determine if the FHT program increases the proportion of general practice patients with CKD receiving appropriate pharmacological therapy (statins alone, ACEI or ARB alone, or both) to reduce CVD risk at 12 months postrandomization compared with active control (primary outcome).<h4>Methods</h4>General practices recruited through practice-based research networks in Victoria and Tasmania were randomly allocated 1:1 to the FHT CKD module or active control. The intervention was delivered to practices between October 4, 2021, and September 30, 2022. Data extracted from EMRs for eligible patients identified at baseline were used to evaluate the trial outcomes at the completion of the intervention period. The primary analysis used an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention effect for the primary outcome was estimated with a marginal logistic model using generalized estimating equations with robust SE.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, of the 734 eligible patients from 19 intervention practices and 715 from 21 control practices, 82 (11.2%) and 70 (9.8%), respectively, had received appropriate pharmacological therapy (statins alone, ACEI or ARB alone, or both) at 12 months postintervention to reduce CVD risk, with an estimated between-trial group difference (Diff) of 2.0% (95% CI -1.6% to 5.7%) and odds ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.81; P=.26). Of the 470 intervention patients and 425 control patients that received a recommendation for statins, 61 (13%) and 38 (9%) were prescribed statins at follow-up (Diff 4.3%, 95% CI 0 to 8.6%; odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.35; P=.04). There was no statistical evidence to support between-group differences in other secondary outcomes and general practice health care use.<h4>Conclusions</h4>FHT harnesses the data stored within EMRs to translate guidelines into practice through quality improvement activities and active clinical decision support. In this instance, it did not result in a difference in prescribing or clinical outcomes except for small changes in statin prescribing. This may relate to COVID-19-related disruptions, technical implementation challenges, and recruiting higher performing practices to the trial. A separate process evaluation will further explore factors impacting implementation and engagement with FHT.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ACTRN12620000993998; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=380119.", "authors": "Manski-Nankervis JA; Hunter B; Lumsden N; Laughlin A; McMorrow R; Boyle D; Chondros P; Jesudason S; Radford J; Prictor M; Emery J; Amores P; Tran-Duy A; Nelson C", "first_author_affiliation": "Primary Care and Family Medicine, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Singapore, Singapore.", "journal": "JMIR formative research", "pub_date": "2025-02-03", "doi": "10.2196/54147", "score": "5.0", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(abstract); clinical decision support(kw,abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Kidney; Logistic model; Cardiovascular disease; Support; General Practice; Medical Records; risk; Kidney Disease; Chronic Kidney Disease; Primary Care; Pharmacological Therapy; Decision Support; Clinical Decision Support; Electronic Medical Record; Pharmacological; cardiovascular; Risk Reduction; Clinical Decision"}, {"pmid": "39910601", "title": "Healthcare trajectories of aging individuals during their last year of life: application of process mining methods to administrative health databases.", "abstract": "<h4>Context</h4>World is aging and the prevalence of chronic diseases is raising with age, increasing financial strain on organizations but also affecting patients' quality of life until death. Research on healthcare trajectories has gained importance, as it can help anticipate patients' needs and optimize service organization. In an overburdened system, it is essential to develop automated methods based on comprehensive and reliable and already available data to model and predict healthcare trajectories and future utilization. Process mining, a family of process management and data science techniques used to derive insights from the data generated by a process, can be a solid candidate to provide a useful tool to support decision-making.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to (1) identify the healthcare baseline trajectories during the last year of life, (2) identify the differences in trajectories according to medical condition, and (3) identify adequate settings to provide a useful output.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied process mining techniques on a retrospective longitudinal cohort of 21,255 individuals who died between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2018, and were at least 66 years or older at death. We used 6 different administrative health databases (emergency visit, hospitalisation, homecare, medical consultation, death register and administrative), to model individuals' healthcare trajectories during their last year of life.<h4>Results</h4>Three main trajectories of healthcare utilization were highlighted: (i) mainly accommodating a long-term care center; (ii) services provided by local community centers in combination with a high proportion of medical consultations and acute care (emergency and hospital); and (iii) combination of consultations, emergency visits and hospitalization with no other management by local community centers or LTCs. Stratifying according to the cause of death highlighted that LTC accommodation was preponderant for individuals who died of physical and cognitive frailty. Conversely, services offered by local community centers were more prevalent among individuals who died of a terminal illness. This difference is potentially related to the access to and use of palliative care at the end-of-life, especially home palliative care implementation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite some limitations related to data and visual limitations, process mining seems to be a method that is both relevant and simple to implement.

Photon-counting detector (PCD) CT offers improved spectral resolution and could potentially enable visualization of hepatocyte-specific GBCA given their associated high gadolinium concentrations within hepatocytes. <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the potential of gadoxetate disodium in combination with PCD CT and low-keV VMI reconstructions to achieve an increase in attenuation in a phantom. <b>Methods:</b> A series of solutions was prepared of diluted gadoxetate disodium (concentrations of 0.250-2.5 \u03bcmol/ml, corresponding with doses of 25-200 \u03bcmol/kg, respectively). These solutions, along with deionized water, were evaluated in an anthropomorphic abdominal phantom using a clinical PCD-CT scanner; virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) at 40, 50, 60, and 70 keV, along with virtual noncontrast (VMC) images, were generated. Attenuation measurements were obtained; a linear regression model combined these values with previously reported in vivo data to estimate hepatic enhancement and CNR across doses. <b>Results:</b> Attenuation increased with increasing concentration at a given energy level and with decreasing energy level for a given concentration; VNC images had lowest attenuation. The maximum attenuation reached was 45.2 HU for a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcmol/ml at 40 keV. A concentration of 0.25 \u03bcmol/ml had attenuation at 40 keV of 13.0 HU.

The exosome visualization technology demonstrated that NMD increased visible PSN-derived exosomes in the spinal dorsal horn, enhanced spinal synaptic transmission, and led to visceral pain in CD63-GFPf/+ male mice. The PSN-derived exosomal miR-1306-3p sorted from spinal dorsal horn activated P2X3R, enhanced spinal synaptic transmission, and led to visceral pain in NMD mice. Moreover, upregulation of Rab27a in dorsal root ganglia mediated the increased release of PSN-derived exosomes, and intrathecal injection of siR-Rab27a reduced visible PSN-derived exosomes in spinal cord, suppressed spinal synaptic transmission, and alleviated visceral pain in NMD mice. This and future studies would reveal the detailed mechanisms of PSN-derived exosomes and provide a potential target for clinical treatment of chronic visceral pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.", "authors": "Sun Q; Weng RX; Li YC; Jia SM; Ma CT; Zhang HH; Tang Y; Li R; Xu GY", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, P.

Efficiently handling these data sets and discerning subtle differences across multiple classes remains a significant challenge. In metabolomics, two-class orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models are widely used due to their strong discrimination capabilities and ability to provide interpretable information on class differences. However, these models face challenges in multiclass settings. A common solution is to transform the multiclass comparison into multiple two-class comparisons, which, while more effective than a global multiclass OPLS-DA model, unfortunately results in a manual, time-consuming model-building process with complicated interpretation. Here, we introduce an extension of OPLS-DA for data-driven multiclass classification: orthogonal partial least squares-hierarchical discriminant analysis (OPLS-HDA). OPLS-HDA integrates hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) with the OPLS-DA framework to create a decision tree, addressing multiclass classification challenges and providing intuitive visualization of interclass relationships. To avoid overfitting and ensure reliable predictions, we use cross-validation during model building. Benchmark results show that OPLS-HDA performs competitively across diverse data sets compared to eight established methods. This method represents a significant advancement, offering a powerful tool to dissect complex multiclass data sets.

However, OAI sensitivity to current extrinsic contrast agents is insufficient and limits its role in detecting disease-related biomarkers. The recently introduced concept of photoswitching and temporal unmixing techniques for OAI allows detecting extrinsic contrast with high sensitivity, allowing the visualization of small populations of cells labeled with photoswitching proteins deep within the tissue. However, transgene modification might not be permitted in some cases, such as for diagnostic use. Therefore, it is desirable to leverage the concept of photoswitching OAI towards injectable formulations. Since photoswitchable synthetic dyes are mainly excited by blue wavelengths unsuited for imaging in tissue, we propose exploiting the addition of XTENs to photoswitching proteins towards yielding injectable agents. The addition of XTEN to a protein enhances its plasma half-life and bioavailability, thus allowing its use, for example, in targeted labeling approaches.

The portal vein was 80% occluded between the gastroduodenal and splenic vein entry points. The dog underwent partial pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and portal venotomy. Following identification of the thrombus by direct visualization and palpation, Rummel tourniquets were used to isolate the segment of the portal vein, and portal venotomy was performed over the thrombus. The venotomy was repaired with primary closure. Intraoperative hemorrhage was absent following the release of the vascular isolation. Histopathology was consistent with insulinoma. The dog was discharged 4\u2009days after surgery. Short-term follow up revealed an absence of postoperative complications. The dog was started on adjuvant therapy, and the re-examination 3\u2009months after surgery showed an absence of the clinical signs and a good quality of life. One year after surgery, the dog is still alive with confirmed metastatic disease. Portal venotomy was successful for thrombus removal and this dog tolerated temporary occlusion of the portal vein well.

Extracted DNA samples were pooled category-wise and subjected to the gut microbiome analysis in the Nanopore sequencer targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Burrows-Wheeler Transform, Ferragina-Manzini index, and Krona charts were used for taxonomical classification and visualization of relative abundances of bacterial species within the metagenome. Alpha- and beta-diversity analyses were performed. Atopic pets at day 0 showed elevation in the gut microbiome population with an adequate concentration of pathogens like Escherichia coli and Clostridiodes difficile with lower amounts of the beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus sp, while the pets at 60 days after dietary intervention showed a significant decline in bacterial species like E coli and C difficile with higher amount of Lactobacillus sp. Both control groups showed variations of microbiome between them as well as from the atopic pets. We found a close association of poultry meat/egg diet with gut microbiome population and atopic symptoms as well in dogs, and elimination of such diet could be helpful in clinical recovery.

A challenge of ductoscopy is an adequate treatment of intraductal lesions by complete removal to prevent exploratory duct excision surgery. This study aimed to determine the in vivo feasibility of intraductal laser ablation during ductoscopy to remove intraductal lesions in patients suffering from pathological nipple discharge (PND).<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective, single-center diagnostic feasibility trial was conducted between October 2022 and November 2023, enrolling adult women with unilateral PND and no radiological suspicion of malignancy. Intraductal laser ablation was performed after incomplete intraductal biopsy using a Thulium laser.<h4>Results</h4>Duct cannulation and subsequent ductoscopic exploration were successful in 21 patients revealing an intraductal lesion in 13 patients (61.9%). From these 13 patients, 9 patients (69.2%) underwent intraductal laser ablation due to a residual lesion after biopsy. Pathology of the removed intraductal lesions showed a papilloma in eight (88.9%) patients and a papilloma/DCIS combination in one patient (11.1%). Post-procedure, PND stopped in 77.8% of the patients (7/9). Two patients had recurrent PND complaints caused by a residual lesion.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Intraductal laser ablation during ductoscopy in patients with papillary lesions seems to be feasible and safe. The Thulium laser enables ablation of residual lesions and is therefore suitable for an immediate second intervention after ductoscopic removal of intraductal lesions.

Biopsy, although considered the gold standard, is invasive, costly, and unsuitable for routine monitoring. Traditional biomarkers, such as creatinine and troponin, offer limited predictive value owing to their low specificity, and conventional imaging techniques often fail to detect early organ damage, increasing the risk of undiagnosed rejection episodes. Considering these limitations, emerging noninvasive biomarkers and molecular imaging techniques hold promise for the early and accurate detection of transplant rejection, enabling personalized management strategies. This review highlights noninvasive biomarkers that predict, diagnose, and assess transplant prognosis by reflecting graft injury, inflammation, and immune responses. For example, donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is highly sensitive in detecting early graft injury, whereas gene expression profiling effectively excludes moderate-to-severe acute rejection (AR). Additionally, microRNA (miRNA) profiling enhances the diagnostic specificity for precise AR detection. Advanced molecular imaging techniques further augment the monitoring of rejection. Fluorescence imaging provides a high spatiotemporal resolution for AR grading, ultrasound offers real-time and portable monitoring, and magnetic resonance delivers high tissue contrast for anatomical assessments. Nuclear imaging modalities such as single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography, enable dynamic visualization of immune responses within transplanted organs. Notably, dd-cfDNA and nuclear medicine imaging have already been integrated into clinical practice, thereby demonstrating the translational potential of these techniques. Unlike previous reviews, this work uniquely synthesizes advancements in both noninvasive biomarkers and molecular imaging, emphasizing their complementary strengths. Biomarkers deliver molecular-level insights, whereas imaging provides spatial and temporal resolution. Together, they create a synergistic framework for comprehensive and precise transplant monitoring. By bridging these domains, this review underscores their individual contributions and collective potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve patient outcomes, and guide future research and clinical applications in transplant medicine.", "authors": "Song Y; Wang Y; Wang W; Xie Y; Zhang J; Liu J; Jin Q; Wu W; Li H; Wang J; Zhang L; Yang Y; Gao T; Xie M", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Ultrasound Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 JieFang Avenue, Wuhan, 430022, China.", "journal": "Journal of translational medicine", "pub_date": "2025-02-03", "doi": "10.1186/s12967-024-05964-4", "score": "2.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Biomarkers; Molecular Imaging; Noninvasive Monitoring; Transplant Rejection"}, {"pmid": "39905431", "title": "Quantifying the tumour vasculature environment from CD-31 immunohistochemistry images of breast cancer using deep learning based semantic segmentation.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Tumour vascular density assessed from CD-31 immunohistochemistry (IHC) images has previously been shown to have prognostic value in breast cancer. Current methods to measure vascular density, however, are time-consuming, suffer from high inter-observer variability and are limited in describing the complex tumour vasculature morphometry.<h4>Methods</h4>We propose a method for automatically measuring a range of vascular parameters from CD-31 IHC images, which together provide a detailed description of the vasculature morphology. We first used a U-Net based convolutional neural network, trained and validated using 36 partially annotated whole slide images from 27 patients, to segment vessel structures and tumour regions from which the measurements are taken. The model also segments the vascular smooth muscle, benign epithelium, adipose tissue, stroma, lymphocyte clusters, nerves and CD-31 positive leukocytes, and we applied it to an additional 21 images from 15 patients. Using these segmentations, we investigated the relationship between the various tissue types and the vasculature and studied the relationship of various vascular parameters with clinical parameters. We also performed a 3D histology analysis on a separate tumour sample as a proof of principle, providing a more comprehensive visualization of vasculature morphology compared to the standard 2D cross-section of a tissue sample.<h4>Results</h4>Using two-way cross-validation, we show that vessels were accurately segmented, with Dice scores of 0.875 and 0.856, and were accurately identified, with F1 scores of 0.777 and 0.748. All vascular parameters exhibit strong ( r>0.7 ) and significant (p<0.001) correlations with measurements taken from the manual ground truth vessel segmentations. A significant relationship between the major/minor axis ratio, a measure of elongation, and the tumour grade was found.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our proposed method shows promise as a tool for studying the tumour vasculature and its relationship with surrounding cells and tissue types. Furthermore, the correlation with tumour grade highlights the clinical relevance of our approach.

Shortly after its origin, the SCA branches into the right coronary artery (RCA), the left anterior descending artery (LAD), and the left circumflex artery (LCx). When the SCA originates from the right coronary sinus, the LAD may follow one of several abnormal courses, including the posterior atrioventricular groove, retro-aortic, interarterial, intraseptal, prepulmonic, or posterior-anterior interventricular groove. Assessing the anatomical risk and the presence of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) in the anomalous vessel is essential for determining the appropriate treatment.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We present a very rare case of a retro-aortic LAD course originating from SCA of the right coronary sinus in a patient admitted to our clinic for evaluation of chest pain. Coronary angiography (CA) of the right coronary system revealed a SCA. RCA was occluded, with chronic total occlusion (CTO). Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was done to specify the course of LAD, which showed a SCA and a posterior course around the aorta of LAD.<h4>Clinical discussion</h4>CA is a valuable tool to identify and classify coronary artery anomalies (CAAs), but due to invasiveness, low spatial resolution, and lack of three-dimensional images, it has been progressively replaced by CCTA. CCTA is the gold standard for diagnosis of the CAAs that enabling three-dimensional visualization of the surrounding cardiac and non-cardiac structures identify patients with malignant CAAs. Taking into account the presence of SCA and CTO, the treatment option is recanalization of CTO or cardiac surgery if refractory angina is present.<h4>Conclusion</h4>When the SCA originates from the right coronary sinus, identifying the abnormal course of the LAD is critical, as it may be life-threatening. Alongside CA, CCTA plays a key role in evaluating the anatomy and associated risks of this anomaly.

In addition, older adults often use over-the-counter medications and supplements, further complicating their medication regimens. Complex medication regimens are potentially harmful to older adults. Interventions aimed at reducing medication discrepancy in the ambulatory clinic setting, such as reviews of medication lists and the implementation of \"brown bag\" reconciliation, continue to be challenging, with limited success. Pharmacist-led interventions to improve appropriate medication use in older adults have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing ADRs. Video visits have the potential to provide direct visualization of medications in older adults' homes, thereby reducing medication discrepancy and increasing medication adherence. Pharmacist-led management of older adults' medication regimens may improve appropriate medication use in older adults.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study is to examine the effect of pharmacist-led medication through home televisits compared to usual care on appropriate medication use, medication discrepancies, medication adherence, and ADRs.<h4>Methods</h4>We will conduct a 2-site cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). The intervention will be a pharmacist-led home televisit including medication reconciliation and assessment of actual medication use. The cluster RCT was iteratively adapted after a pilot test. The primary outcome of medication appropriateness of the intervention will be measured using the STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions) criteria for potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) at 6 months. Medication lists obtained will be compared against electronic medical records (EMRs) by a clinician to establish discrepancies in medications. The clinician will review medications using the validated Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI).<h4>Results</h4>This project has been peer-reviewed and selected for support by the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Services Research Service. The pilot phase of the study was completed December 2021 with 20 veterans and was primarily informed by the Steinman model of the prescribing process adapted to include system- and provider-level factors. The last date of enrollment was August 6, 2021. We anticipate the completion of the ongoing trial in spring 2025. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2025.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The cluster RCT will provide evidence on medication management through televisits. If found effective in improving the use of medications, the intervention has the potential to impact older adults with multiple chronic conditions and polypharmacy.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04340570; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04340570.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>PRR1-10.2196/65141.", "authors": "Hossain SR; Samant AN; Balsamo BC; Hawley CE; Zanchelli MC; Zhu C; Venegas MD; Robertson M; McCullough MB; Beizer JL; Boockvar KS; Siu AL; Moo LR; Hung WW", "first_author_affiliation": "James J Peters VA Medical Center, Bronx, NY, United States.", "journal": "JMIR research protocols", "pub_date": "2025-02-05", "doi": "10.2196/65141", "score": "2.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Adverse drug reaction; Medication Management; Polypharmacy; Older Adults; Televisit"}, {"pmid": "39907648", "title": "Near-Infrared-II Fluorescent Probes for Analytical Applications: From &lt;i&gt;In Vitro&lt;/i&gt; Detection to &lt;i&gt;In Vivo&lt;/i&gt; Imaging Monitoring.", "abstract": "ConspectusBiomarkers play a vital role in the regulation of life processes, especially in predicting the occurrence and development of diseases. For the early diagnosis and precise treatment of diseases, it has become necessary and significant to detect biomarkers with sensitivity, accuracy, simplicity, convenience, and even visualization. Fluorescent-probe-based techniques have been recognized as one of the most powerful tools for the sensitive detection and real time imaging of biomarkers in biological samples. However, traditional optical probes, mainly including the visible probes (400-700 nm) and the near-infrared I (NIR-I, 700-900 nm) probes, suffer from low sensitivity, poor resolution, strong absorption and scattering, and high background fluorescence, which hinder effective monitoring of biomarkers.Fortunately, the past decade has witnessed a remarkable evolution in the application fields of near-infrared II (NIR-II, 900-1700 nm) fluorescence, driven by its exceptional optical characteristics and the advancement of imaging technologies. Leveraging the superior penetration capabilities, negligible autofluorescence, and extended fluorescence emission wavelengths, NIR-II fluorescent probes significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of <i>in vitro</i> detection (IVD) and the temporal resolution of <i>in vivo</i> imaging.
