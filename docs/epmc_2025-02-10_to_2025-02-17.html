", "abstract": "The DECODE-3DViz pipeline represents a major advancement in the web-based visualization of large-scale medical imaging data, particularly for peripheral artery computed tomography images. This research addresses the critical challenges of rendering high-resolution volumetric datasets via WebGL technology. By integrating progressive chunk streaming and level of detail (LOD) algorithms, DECODE-3DViz optimizes the rendering process for real-time interaction and high-fidelity visualization. The system efficiently manages WebGL texture size constraints and browser memory limitations, ensuring smooth performance even with extensive datasets. A comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art visualization tools demonstrates DECODE-3DViz's superior performance, achieving up to a 98% reduction in rendering time compared with that of competitors and maintaining a high frame rate of up to 144 FPS. Furthermore, the system exhibits exceptional GPU memory efficiency, utilizing as little as 2.6\u00a0MB on desktops, which is significantly less than the over 100\u00a0MB required by other tools. User feedback, collected through a comprehensive questionnaire, revealed high satisfaction with the tool's performance, particularly in areas such as structure definition and diagnostic capability, with an average score of 4.3 out of 5. These enhancements enable detailed and accurate visualizations of the peripheral vasculature, improving diagnostic accuracy and supporting better clinical outcomes.

While many studies have identified strong associations between specific SDoH and health outcomes, little is known about how SDoH co-occur to form subtypes critical for designing targeted interventions. Such analysis has only now become possible through the All of Us program.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to analyze the All of Us dataset for addressing two research questions: (1) What are the range of and responses to survey questions related to SDoH? and (2) How do SDoH co-occur to form subtypes, and what are their risks for adverse health outcomes?<h4>Methods</h4>For question 1, an expert panel analyzed the range of and responses to SDoH questions across 6 surveys in the full All of Us dataset (N=372,397; version 6). For question 2, due to systematic missingness and uneven granularity of questions across the surveys, we selected all participants with valid and complete SDoH data and used inverse probability weighting to adjust their imbalance in demographics. Next, an expert panel grouped the SDoH questions into SDoH factors to enable more consistent granularity. To identify the subtypes, we used bipartite modularity maximization for identifying SDoH biclusters and measured their significance and replicability. Next, we measured their association with 3 outcomes (depression, delayed medical care, and emergency room visits in the last year). Finally, the expert panel inferred the subtype labels, potential mechanisms, and targeted interventions.<h4>Results</h4>The question 1 analysis identified 110 SDoH questions across 4 surveys covering all 5 domains in Healthy People 2030. As the SDoH questions varied in granularity, they were categorized by an expert panel into 18 SDoH factors. The question 2 analysis (n=12,913; d=18) identified 4 biclusters with significant biclusteredness (Q=0.13; random-Q=0.11; z=7.5; P<.001) and significant replication (real Rand index=0.88; random Rand index=0.62; P<.001). Each subtype had significant associations with specific outcomes and had meaningful interpretations and potential targeted interventions. For example, the Socioeconomic barriers subtype included 6 SDoH factors (eg, not employed and food insecurity) and had a significantly higher odds ratio (4.2, 95% CI 3.5-5.1; P<.001) for depression when compared to other subtypes. The expert panel inferred implications of the results for designing interventions and health care policies based on SDoH subtypes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identified SDoH subtypes that had statistically significant biclusteredness and replicability, each of which had significant associations with specific adverse health outcomes and with translational implications for targeted SDoH interventions and health care policies. However, the high degree of systematic missingness requires repeating the analysis as the data become more complete by using our generalizable and scalable machine learning code available on the All of Us workbench.", "authors": "Bhavnani SK; Zhang W; Bao D; Raji M; Ajewole V; Hunter R; Kuo YF; Schmidt S; Pappadis MR; Smith E; Bokov A; Reistetter T; Visweswaran S; Downer B", "first_author_affiliation": "School of Public and Population Health, Department of Biostatistics & Data Science, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, United States.", "journal": "Journal of medical Internet research", "pub_date": "2025-02-11", "doi": "10.2196/48775", "score": "7.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(title); visual(title); machine learning(kw,abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Health care; Decision Support; Health Outcomes; Clinical Implications; Social Determinants Of Health; Health Industry; Machine Learning Methods; Precision Medicine; Bipartite Networks; Financial Resources; All Of Us"}, {"pmid": "39947302", "title": "Unveiling the Brain Mechanism underlying Depression: 12 Years of Insights from Bibliometric and Visualization Analysis. ", "abstract": "Depression is a common but serious mental health illness affected human's physiology and psychology. In contemporary times, neurophysiological research on depression has emerged as a prominent area of investigation, yet there remains a paucity of review elucidating the central mechanisms of depression in the brain. Consequently, we undertook a bibliometric analysis and visualization assessment to underscore recent advancements in research pertaining to the neural underpinnings of depression. By employing these methods, we have collected articles spanning the period from 2013 to 2024, shedding light on the latest insights into the brain mechanisms associated with depression. Bibliometric analysis found 16327 research papers in the field of brain mechanism underlying depression, overall showing a sustained growth trend.

The project titled Take Care Texas aims to develop and test an adaptive, multilevel, community-based intervention to increase COVID-19 testing and vaccination uptake among vulnerable populations in 3 Texas regions: Harris County, Cameron County, and Northeast Texas.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to develop a novel procedure for adaptive selections of census block groups (CBGs) to include in the community-based randomized trial for the Take Care Texas project.<h4>Methods</h4>CBG selection was conducted across 3 Texas regions over a 17-month period (May 2021 to October 2022). We developed persistent and recent COVID-19 burden metrics, using real-time SARS-CoV-2 monitoring data to capture dynamic infection patterns. To identify vulnerable populations, we also developed a CBG-level community disparity index, using 12 contextual social determinants of health (SDOH) measures from US census data. In each adaptive round, we determined the priority CBGs based on their COVID-19 burden and disparity index, ensuring geographic separation to minimize intervention \"spillover.\" Community input and feedback from local partners and health workers further refined the selection. The selected CBGs were then randomized into 2 intervention arms-multilevel intervention and just-in-time adaptive intervention-and 1 control arm, using covariate adaptive randomization, at a 1:1:1 ratio. We developed interactive data dashboards, which included maps displaying the locations of selected CBGs and community-level information, to inform the selection process and guide intervention delivery. Selection and randomization occurred across 10 adaptive rounds.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 120 CBGs were selected and followed the stepped planning and interventions, with 60 in Harris County, 30 in Cameron County, and 30 in Northeast Texas counties. COVID-19 burden presented substantial temporal changes and local variations across CBGs. COVID-19 burden and community disparity exhibited some common geographical patterns but also displayed distinct variations, particularly at different time points throughout this study. This underscores the importance of incorporating both real-time monitoring data and contextual SDOH in the selection process.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The novel procedure integrated real-time monitoring data and geospatial data science to enhance the design and adaptive delivery of a community-based randomized trial. Adaptive selection effectively prioritized the most in-need communities and allowed for a rigorous evaluation of community-based interventions in a multilevel trial. This methodology has broad applicability and can be adapted to other public health intervention and prevention programs, providing a powerful tool for improving population health and addressing health disparities.", "authors": "Zhang K; Hunyadi JV; de Oliveira Otto MC; Lee M; Zhang Z; Ramphul R; Yamal JM; Yaseen A; Morrison AC; Sharma S; Rahbar MH; Zhang X; Linder S; Marko D; Roy RW; Banerjee D; Guajardo E; Crum M; Reininger B; Fernandez ME; Bauer C", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, 1200 Pressler St., RAS-E819, Houston, TX, 77030, United States, 1 7135009581.", "journal": "JMIR formative research", "pub_date": "2025-02-11", "doi": "10.2196/62802", "score": "6.0", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(kw,abstract); data(kw,abstract)", "api_keywords": "Public Health; Study Design; Social Determinants Of Health; Geospatial Analysis; Community-based Interventions; Covid-19 Testing; Data Dashboard; Covid-19 Vaccination"}, {"pmid": "39954731", "title": "Why go blind if you can see the airway?: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 ir a ciegas, si se puede visualizar la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea? ", "abstract": "Airway management is a critical aspect of anesthesiology, essential for ensuring patient safety during various medical interventions, including surgery, emergency care, and critical care settings. Despite advancements, difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation remain significant challenges, particularly in emergency scenarios, posing risks of hypoxia, brain damage, and death. This article examines the efficacy of videolaryngoscopy (VLS) and video laryngeal mask airways (VLMA) in improving airway management outcomes compared to traditional techniques across diverse clinical environments. We conducted a comprehensive review of literature and current practices, analyzing the advantages and limitations of VLS and VLMA. The paper highlights the importance of visualization in airway management and evaluates the effectiveness of these devices in various settings. VLS and VLMA offer several benefits over traditional direct laryngoscopy, including enhanced glottic visualization, higher first-attempt success rates, reduced rates of oxygen desaturation, and fewer adverse events. These devices provide a larger angle of view and allow for real-time monitoring, improving overall patient safety. Additionally, they serve as excellent educational tools for training anesthesiologists and other healthcare providers involved in airway management. In emergency and critical care scenarios, the rapid and accurate placement of airway devices is crucial. VLS and VLMA facilitate quicker and more reliable intubation, reducing the likelihood of complications such as esophageal intubation or airway trauma. These technologies also allow for better teamwork and coordination as the airway view can be shared with the entire medical team. The adoption of VLS and VLMA as standard practice in airway management can significantly enhance visualization and success rates, reducing the risk of complications. These devices should be integrated into routine clinical use to improve patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to optimize their application and explore advancements such as artificial intelligence in airway management.", "authors": "Van Zundert AAJ; G\u00f3mez-R\u00edos M\u00c1; Van Zundert TCRV", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Anaesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

Although some data suggest older adults see privacy as an ethical barrier to adopting digital technologies, little is known about privacy concerns regarding information shared with novel patient-facing chatbots. We sought to examine attitudes toward privacy based on age or other sociodemographic characteristics.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a sequential mixed methods study among patient users of a large healthcare system chatbot. We purposively oversampled by race and ethnicity to survey 3089 patient chatbot users online using de novo and validated items. Next, we conducted semi-structured interviews with users (n\u2009=\u200946) purposively sampled based on diversity or select survey responses. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze survey data and modified grounded theory to analyze interviews. We integrated data using simultaneous visualization and triangulation.<h4>Results</h4>We received 617/3089 surveys (response rate, 20.0%). Overall, 370/597 (63.9%) expressed worry about the privacy of information shared with the chatbot. Logistic regression found that users \u2265\u200965\u2009years were 26% points less likely to be worried about information privacy compared to those 18-34\u2009years old (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We found less worry among Black, non-Hispanic users and among those with more than a four-year college degree. By integrating our survey and interview data, we observed that older adult users experienced a halo effect: they worried less because they saw the chatbot as associated with a trusted health system and experienced lower medical mistrust.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Contrary to some prior research, adults aged 65 and older expressed less concern about chatbot privacy than younger adults because of their trust in health care. To maintain this trust and build it among all users, health systems using patient-facing chatbots need to take active steps to maintain and communicate patient privacy protections.", "authors": "Ellis JR; Dellavalle NS; Hamer MK; Akerson M; Andazola M; Moore AA; Campbell EG; DeCamp M", "first_author_affiliation": "Center for Bioethics and Humanities, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA.", "journal": "Journal of the American Geriatrics Society", "pub_date": "2025-02-12", "doi": "10.1111/jgs.19393", "score": "5.0", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Privacy; Chatbot"}, {"pmid": "39939843", "title": "Haematology dimension reduction, a large scale application to regular care haematology data.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The routine diagnostic process increasingly entails the processing of high-volume and high-dimensional data that cannot be directly visualised. This processing may provide scaling issues that limit the implementation of these types of data into research as well as integrated diagnostics in routine care. Here, we investigate whether we can use existing dimension reduction techniques to provide visualisations and analyses for a complete bloodcount (CBC) while maintaining representativeness of the original data. We considered over 3 million CBC measurements encompassing over 70 parameters of cell frequency, size and complexity from the UMC Utrecht UPOD database. We evaluated PCA as an example of a linear dimension reduction techniques and UMAP, TriMap and PaCMAP as non-linear dimension reduction techniques. We assessed their technical performance using quality metrics for dimension reduction as well as biological representation by evaluating preservation of diurnal, age and sex patterns, cluster preservation and the identification of leukemia patients.<h4>Results</h4>We found that, for clinical hematology data, PCA performs systematically better than UMAP, TriMap and PaCMAP in representing the underlying data. Biological relevance was retained for periodicity in the data. However, we also observed a decrease in predictive performance of the reduced data for both age and sex, as well as an overestimation of clusters within the reduced data. Finally, we were able to identify the diverging patterns for leukemia patients after use of dimensionality reduction methods.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We conclude that for hematology data, the use of unsupervised dimension reduction techniques should be limited to data visualization applications, as implementing them in diagnostic pipelines may lead to decreased quality of integrated diagnostics in routine care.", "authors": "Joosse HJ; Chumsaeng-Reijers C; Huisman A; Hoefer IE; van Solinge WW; Haitjema S; van Es B", "first_author_affiliation": "Central Diagnostic Laboratory, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, Utrecht, 3584 CX, The Netherlands.", "journal": "BMC medical informatics and decision making", "pub_date": "2025-02-12", "doi": "10.1186/s12911-025-02899-8", "score": "4.8", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)", "api_keywords": "Clustering; Haematology; Dimension Reduction; Data Preservation; Routine Care Data"}, {"pmid": "39932770", "title": "Visualizing YouTube Commenters' Conceptions of the US Health Care System: Semantic Network Analysis Method for Evidence-Based Policy Making.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The challenge of extracting meaningful patterns from the overwhelming noise of social media to guide decision-makers remains largely unresolved.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to evaluate the application of a semantic network method for creating an interactive visualization of social media discourse surrounding the US health care system.<h4>Methods</h4>Building upon bibliometric approaches to conducting health studies, we repurposed the VOSviewer software program to analyze 179,193 YouTube comments about the US health care system. Using the overlay-enhanced semantic network method, we mapped the contents and structure of the commentary evoked by 53 YouTube videos uploaded in 2014 to 2023 by right-wing, left-wing, and centrist media outlets. The videos included newscasts, full-length documentaries, political satire, and stand-up comedy. We analyzed term co-occurrence network clusters, contextualized with custom-built information layers called overlays, and performed tests of the semantic network's robustness, representativeness, structural relevance, semantic accuracy, and usefulness for decision support. We examined how the comments mentioning 4 health system design concepts-universal health care, Medicare for All, single payer, and socialized medicine-were distributed across the network terms.<h4>Results</h4>Grounded in the textual data, the macrolevel network representation unveiled complex discussions about illness and wellness; health services; ideology and society; the politics of health care agendas and reforms, market regulation, and health insurance; the health care workforce; dental care; and wait times. We observed thematic alignment between the network terms, extracted from YouTube comments, and the videos that elicited these comments. Discussions about illness and wellness persisted across time, as well as international comparisons of costs of ambulances, specialist care, prescriptions, and appointment wait times. The international comparisons were linked to commentaries with a higher concentration of British-spelled words, underscoring the global nature of the US health care discussion, which attracted domestic and global YouTube commenters. Shortages of nurses, nurse burnout, and their contributing factors (eg, shift work, nurse-to-patient staffing ratios, and corporate greed) were covered in comments with many likes. Comments about universal health care had much higher use of ideological terms than comments about single-payer health systems.<h4>Conclusions</h4>YouTube users addressed issues of societal and policy relevance: social determinants of health, concerns for populations considered vulnerable, health equity, racism, health care quality, and access to essential health services. Versatile and applicable to health policy studies, the method presented and evaluated in our study supports evidence-based decision-making and contextualized understanding of diverse viewpoints.

Through extensive testing on data from hospitalized patients containing atypical cases (spinal deformity, obesity), we confirmed that SUIGS generalizes across different individuals with a 100% success rate in aligning with preoperative CT. Furthermore, SUIGS yielded comparable results to three-dimensional fluoroscopy guidance in intraoperative intraspinal tumor localization and reduced the procedure to 8\u00a0min.

These neuromonitoring modalities have been crucial, particularly in complex procedures with limited direct visualization. Refinements in these techniques have led to greater confidence in nerve root safety, contributing to the success of MISS. Despite some debate regarding the routine use of neuromonitoring in noncomplex surgeries, its importance in complex cases is well-documented.

Upon recognizing a target, the interaction between the two protein coronas on the same nucleic acid molecule triggers cross-linked aggregation of AuNPs. Then, a target as low as 100 aM can be visually detected within 30 min, making the platform particularly well-suited for rapid POC application and the screening of emerging epidemics. Additionally, the superior LSPR properties of AuNPs increase the light-scattering signal generated during target-induced aggregation, enabling the visualization of the aggregated AuNPs as diffraction-limited spots under confocal microscopy. By counting these spots, the platform achieves unprecedented detection sensitivity, identifying a target as low as 1 aM, which is equivalent to just 6 molecules in a 10 \u03bcL system, demonstrating single-molecule detection capability. This dual protein corona-mediated detection system offers exceptional promise for large-scale screening of pathogenic viruses and the early detection of cancer, particularly in applications requiring ultrahigh sensitivity at the single-molecule level.", "authors": "Zhang B; Zhang P; Wang H; Wang X; Hu Z; Wang F; Li Z", "first_author_affiliation": "Beijing Key Laboratory for Bioengineering and Sensing Technology, School of Chemistry and Biological Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China.", "journal": "ACS nano", "pub_date": "2025-02-14", "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.4c13924", "score": "4.1", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract)", "api_keywords": "Colorimetric Detection; Nucleic Acid Detection; Dual Protein Coronas; Single-molecule Level; Light-scattering Imaging"}, {"pmid": "39953862", "title": "Comparison of a Besdata Video Laryngoscope With a Direct Laryngoscope in Neonates and Infants of 6\u2009Months of Age-A Randomized Controlled Trial.

In this study, we compared the Besdata video laryngoscope with the Miller laryngoscope in neonates and infants 6\u2009months of age. After obtaining informed written consent from the parents, we randomized 80 infants scheduled for elective surgery requiring endotracheal intubation into two groups, Group DL and Group VL. We used a direct laryngoscope with a Miller blade in group DL and a Besdata video laryngoscope with a Miller blade in group VL. We compared the time taken for intubation, glottis visualization time, percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score, Cormack Lehane (CL) grades, first attempt success rate, need for external laryngeal manipulation, and complications between the two groups. The median (interquartile range, IQR) time taken for intubation was 36.0\u2009s (30.5-39.0) versus 35.0\u2009s (28.0-40.0) (p\u2009=\u20090.35), similar in both groups. The median difference (95% confidence interval, CI) was 0.0\u2009s [-4.0 to 5.0]. The median (IQR) time for glottic visualization was 13.0\u2009s (10.0-15.5) versus 10.0\u2009s (8.0-12.0), and the median difference (95% CI) was 2.0\u2009s [1-6] in group DL and group VL, respectively, showing shorter time with a video laryngoscope. We also found better POGO scores and decreased need for optimal external laryngeal manipulation with a Besdata video laryngoscope. The first attempt intubation success rate, use of bougie, and complications were similar in both groups. The Besdata video laryngoscope with a zero-size Miller blade has shown a similar intubation time when compared with a conventional laryngoscope in neonates and infants of 6\u2009months of age. The first attempt intubation success rate was also comparable between the two groups. However, the Besdata video laryngoscope is associated with comparatively better glottic visualization.

The unique demands of football athletes create large magnitude rotational moments about the ankle, even during low impact maneuvers. This review explores the structure and function of the syndesmosis, assesses recent data in football athletes at the professional and collegiate levels regarding epidemiology, describes available treatment options, and provides example cases from the authors' institution. The review concludes with clinical and surgical pearls for the evaluation and treatment of syndesmotic injury.<h4>Recent findings</h4>In general, flexible syndesmotic fixation has demonstrated similar clinical outcome scores as rigid fixation. Flexible fixation has demonstrated benefit over rigid fixation in terms of implant failure, hardware removal, and local irritation. Both flexible and rigid fixation remain viable options for treatment of syndesmotic injuries yet the indications for selecting a construct are often subjective. Certain cases of high-risk football players such as linemen may warrant careful consideration of rigid fixation options despite the clinical advantages of flexible fixation. During fixation, direct visualization techniques with open or arthroscopic assistance for reduction of the syndesmosis remain superior and enable diagnosis of chondral defects. Flexible and rigid syndesmotic fixation techniques are viable for treatment of unstable syndesmotic injuries in athletes. Recent literature favors flexible fixation. However, at-risk football athletes or those with length unstable fibula fractures may benefit from rigid or supplemental flexible fixation as opposed to traditional flexible fixation.

Diabesity is a major global epidemic and a veritable planetary health burden. With diabesity, several clinical signs are present such as excess accumulation of fat, altered lipid metabolism, chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, disordered pancreatic \u03b2-cell metabolism, and hyperglycemia. We report here new potential candidate genes for diabesity, and the structural and functional effects of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in these genes using a computational biology approach. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using Human Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction rEference (HIPPIE') data for 186 diabesity-associated genes from the Disease Gene Network (DisGeNET). Subsequently, the top 2% of nine centrality-ranked genes were identified as hub genes. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed with the same gene list using the Gene Ontology enRIchment anaLysis and visuaLizAtion (GORILLA) tool, and importantly, 63 enriched hub genes with no prior disease association were selected and their differential expressions in adipose, skeletal, and hepatic tissues were analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) profiles. Finally, the nsSNPs in the top five prioritized genes (<i>EGFR</i>, <i>SRC</i>, <i>SQSTM1</i>, <i>CCND1</i>, and <i>RELA</i>) were retrieved from Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP) and subjected to deleterious variant analysis. The significant variants were subjected to structural prediction using AlphaFold, stability analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation using GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS). Taken together, the present computational biology research reports new molecular insights on diabesity candidate genes and the role of nsSNPs that may potentially contribute to diabesity. As diabesity and diabetes continue to be major planetary health challenges, these findings warrant further <i>in vitro</i> and clinical translation research with an eye to precision medicine and therapeutics innovation.

Misleading drug function is a common reason for adverse drug reactions and drug failures. A computational approach can aid in correctly identifying drug functions during clinical testing. Therefore, this study proposes a neural network-based nearest neighbor approach using the Multi-Label Convolutional Neural Network and Nearest Neighbor (MLCNN-NN) method to identify drug functions from chemical 2D structures. This model is built upon the hypothesis that chemical compounds (drugs) with similar molecular structures are likely to exhibit similar drug functions, and the drug functions that occur together are likely to share similar chemical structures. The findings illustrate that the presented models can accurately predict the functions of drugs and outperform the performance of ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetv2, Inceptionv3, VGG19, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Meyer et al. models. The proposed model is evaluated on a benchmark dataset of drug molecules with known functions and achieves the highest accuracy value of 98.10%. Moreover, the identification and visualization of co-occurring drug functions serve as solid indicators of the effectiveness of the proposed model in detecting potential co-occurrence of drug functions, with detection rates of 84.02%.

Twenty-two patients undergoing surgery for malignant brain tumor resection were examined. Intravenous ICG (250 mg) was administered within 24 hours prior to surgery. All procedures were performed under endoscopic guidance. The fluorescence intensity of the tumors was monitored using fluorescence mode endoscopy. Specimens including resection margins were harvested and submitted for histopathological analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of FESWICG were validated using contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging performed within 24 hours of surgery and histopathology. The Karnofsky performance scale was used to assess overall functional status before and after surgery. The tumor diagnoses were as follows: glioma (n = 14), ependymoma (n = 1), metastasis (n = 5), lymphoma (n = 1), and choroid plexus papilloma (n = 1). Intraoperative tumor fluorescence was strong in 20 patients and weak in two. Postoperative contrast-enhanced imaging revealed complete tumor resection in 18 patients (81.82%). Sixty-four tumor specimens were collected, including 42 obtained from tumor margins. Using histopathology as the reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of FESWICG for detection of malignant brain tumors were 91.42%, 41.38%, 65.31%, and 80%. The median Karnofsky performance scale score was 85 before surgery and 93 at the 3-month follow-up. SWICG notably enhanced intraoperative visualization of malignant brain tumors, particularly the delineation between tumor and normal brain. Its utility for margin detection is promising. When utilized in conjunction with a full endoscopic system, the visual acuity and overall effectiveness of surgical procedures can be substantially enhanced.

Animal studies based on small rodents are usually performed using dedicated preclinical imaging systems with high spatial resolution. For studies that require animal models such as mini-pigs or New-Zealand White (NZW) rabbits, imaging systems with larger bore sizes are required. In case of hybrid imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), clinical systems have to be used, as these animal models do not typically fit in preclinical simultaneous PET-MRI scanners.<i>Approach.</i>In this paper, we present initial imaging results obtained with the Hyperion II<sup>D</sup>PET insert which can accommodate NZW rabbits when combined with a large volume MRI RF coil. First, we developed a rabbit-sized image quality phantom of comparable size to a NZW rabbit in order to evaluate the PET imaging performance of the insert under high count rates. For this phantom, radioactive spheres with inner diameters between 3.95 and7.86mm were visible in a warm background with a tracer activity ratio of 4.1 to 1 and with a total<sup>18</sup>F activity in the phantom of58MBq at measurement start. Second, we performed simultaneous PET-MR imaging of atherosclerotic plaques in a rabbit<i>in vivo</i>using a single injection containing<sup>18</sup>F-FDG for detection of inflammatory activity, and Gd-ESMA for visualization of the aortic vessel wall and plaques with MRI.<i>Main results.</i>The fused PET-MR images reveal<sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake within an active plaques with plaque thicknesses in the sub-millimeter range. Histology showed colocalization of<sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake with macrophages in the aortic vessel wall lesions.<i>Significance.</i>Our initial results demonstrate that this PET insert is a promising system for simultaneous high-resolution PET-MR atherosclerotic plaque imaging studies in NZW rabbits.", "authors": "Gebhardt P; Lavin B; Phinikaridou A; MacKewn J; Henningsson M; Schug D; Salomon A; Marsden PK; Schulz V; Botnar RM", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "pub_date": "2025-02-11", "doi": "10.1088/1361-6560/ad8c1f", "score": "2.5", "matched_keywords": "visualization(abstract); visual(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Atherosclerosis; Hyperion; Pet-mri; Pet Insert; Rabbit Imaging"}, {"pmid": "39932772", "title": "mHealth App to Promote Healthy Lifestyles for Diverse Families Living in Rural Areas: Usability Study.", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Mobile Integrated Care for Childhood Obesity is a multicomponent intervention for caregivers of young children with obesity from rural communities that was developed in collaboration with community, parent, and health care partners. It includes community programming to promote healthy lifestyles and address social needs and health care visits with an interdisciplinary team. A digital mobile health platform-the Healthy Lifestyle (Nemours Children's Health) dashboard-was designed as a self-management tool for caregivers to use as part of Mobile Integrated Care for Childhood Obesity.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to improve the usability of the English and Spanish language versions of the Healthy Lifestyle dashboard.<h4>Methods</h4>During a 3-phased approach, usability testing was conducted with a diverse group of parents. In total, 7 mothers of children with obesity from rural communities (average age 39, SD 4.9 years; 4 Spanish-speaking and 3 English-speaking) provided feedback on a prototype of the dashboard. Participants verbalized their thoughts while using the prototype to complete 4 tasks. Preferences on the dashboard icon and resource page layout were also collected. Testing was done until feedback reached saturation and no additional substantive changes were suggested. Qualitative and quantitative data regarding usability, acceptability, and understandability were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>The dashboard was noted to be acceptable by 100% (N=7) of the participants. Overall, participants found the dashboard easy to navigate and found the resources, notifications, and ability to communicate with the health care team to be especially helpful. However, all (N=4) of the Spanish-speaking participants identified challenges related to numeracy (eg, difficulty interpreting the growth chart) and literacy (eg, features not fully available in Spanish), which informed iterative refinements to make the dashboard clearer and more literacy-sensitive. All 7 participants (100%) selected the same dashboard icon and 71% (5/7) preferred the final resource page layout.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Conducting usability testing with key demographic populations, especially Spanish-speaking populations, was important to developing a mobile health intervention that is user-friendly, culturally relevant, and literacy-sensitive.", "authors": "Perez Ramirez A; Ortega A; Stephenson N; Mu\u00f1oz Osorio A; Kazak A; Phan TL", "first_author_affiliation": "Center For Healthcare Delivery Science, Nemours Children's Health, Wilmington, DE, United States.", "journal": "JMIR formative research", "pub_date": "2025-02-11", "doi": "10.2196/60495", "score": "2.0", "matched_keywords": "dashboard(abstract); data(abstract)", "api_keywords": "Child; Obesity; Rural Population; Spanish; Mhealth; Mobile Health; User Testing"}, {"pmid": "39947619", "title": "Dare 2 Discuss Social Media Campaign: An educational initiative to improve Opioid Use Disorder discussions between the pharmacist and patient. ", "abstract": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic substance use disorder that currently results in significant morbidity and mortality within the United States. The ONE (Opioid and Naloxone Education) Program is a pharmacy-centered opioid risk screening process to identify patients at risk for OUD and opioid overdose. Three years after inception, data indicated patients screened as high-risk for OUD were receiving opioid safety interventions; however the evaluation noted a lack of OUD education with patients. To describe and assess an educational initiative for pharmacists which is delivered via social media for the improvement of pharmacist-patient communication surrounding OUD education. The initiative was named 'Dare 2 Discuss' and video content was developed to align with prior research citing challenges to healthcare provider-patient OUD education. Data to evaluate pharmacist interventions/education delivered to patients was collected by a pharmacy services documentation platform and social media performance was captured by each respective social media dashboard. The first video was posted on October 1, 2022 and the last video was posted on April 10, 2023. Each video took approximately 2.5 hours to create and averaged 42 seconds in length (17-168 seconds). On average, videos received 233 Facebook views (55-489 views) and 527 Instagram views (232-1434 views). The post-intervention phase indicated that patient receipt of OUD education by the pharmacist increased by 23% and patient receipt of community support services information increased by 68%. 'Dare 2 Discuss' campaign may have improved pharmacist self-efficacy with subsequent adjustment of patient education techniques when addressing OUD conversations. These findings highlight the feasibility of a social media-delivered educational initiative to have a potential impact on factors associated with the opioid crisis and risk-reduction education by pharmacists. Creating relevant and easy-to-digest educational materials for health professionals is an important step in advancing practice and improving patient care. Results from the Dare 2 Discuss campaign suggest that this educational initiative may be an effective method to reach a broad number of pharmacists to improve patient interactions.", "authors": "Frenzel O; Ratz I; Skarphol A; Werremeyer A", "first_author_affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy Practice and Public Health, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND.
