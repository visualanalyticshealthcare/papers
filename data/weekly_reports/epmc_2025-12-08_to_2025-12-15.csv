41364916,Data Visualization Support for Interdisciplinary Team Treatment Planning in Clinical Oncology: Scoping Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Complex and expanding datasets in clinical oncology applications require flexible and interactive visualization of patient data to provide physicians and other medical professionals with maximum amount of information. In particular, interdisciplinary tumor conferences profit from customized tools to integrate, link, and visualize relevant data from all professions involved.<h4>Objective</h4>Our objective was to identify and present currently available data visualization tools for tumor boards and related areas. We wanted to provide an overview of not only the digital tools currently used in tumor board settings but also of the data they include, their respective visualization solutions, and their integration into hospital processes.<h4>Methods</h4>This scoping review was based on the scoping study framework by Arksey and O'Malley and attempted to answer the following research question: ""What are the key features of data visualization solutions used in molecular and organ tumor boards, and how are these elements integrated and used within the clinical setting?"" The following electronic databases were searched for articles: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Articles were deemed eligible if published in English in the last 10 years. Eligible articles were first deduplicated, followed by screening of titles and abstracts. Full-text screening was then conducted to decide on article selection. All included articles were analyzed using a data extraction template. The template included a variety of meta-information, as well as specific fields aiming to answer the research question.<h4>Results</h4>The review process started with 2049 articles, of which 1014 (49.49%) were included in the title and abstract screening. A total of 5.47% (112/2049) of the publications were eligible for full-text screening, leading to 2.93% (60/2049) of the publications being eligible for final inclusion. They covered 49 distinct visualization tools and applications. We discovered a variety of innovative visualization solutions, most often driven by the complexity of omics data, represented in 96% (47/49) of the tools. Tables remained the most used tool for the visualization of data types described in the articles. Approximately one-third of the identified tools (16/49, 33%) were systematically evaluated in some form. For most discovered tools (37/49, 76%), there was no documentation of implementation into the clinical routine. A significant number of applications (21/49, 43%) were available through open-source access.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a wide range of projects providing visualization solutions for tumor boards and clinical oncology applications. Among the few tools that have made their way into clinical routine settings, there are both commercial and academic solutions. While tables for a variety of data types remain the dominant visualization strategy, the complexity of omics data appears to be the driving force behind many visualization innovations in the domain of tumor boards.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>RR2-10.2196/53627.",Boehm D; Strantz C; Ustjanzew A; Manuilova I; Scheiter A; Pauli T; Hechtel N; Reimer N; Christoph J; Busch H; Ganslandt T; Unberath P,"Medical Center for Information and Communication Technology, Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-12-09,10.2196/69104,12.8,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(title,abstract)",Tumor; Software; Visualization; Multidisciplinary; Tumor Board; Clinical Oncology; Scoping Review; Cancer Conference

41379778,COVID-19 vaccination data management and visualization systems for improved decision-making: Lessons learnt from Africa CDC Saving Lives and Livelihoods program.,"The DHIS2 system enabled real-time tracking of vaccine distribution and administration to facilitate data-driven decisions. Experts from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and Management Information System (MIS) teams, with support from the Health Information Systems Program South Africa (HISP-SA), developed the continental COVID-19 vaccination tracking system. Several variables related to COVID-19 vaccination were considered in developing the system. Three-hundred fifty users can access the system at different levels with specific roles and privileges. Four dashboards with high-level summary visualizations were developed for top leadership for decision-making, while pages with detailed programmatic results are available to other users depending on their level of access. Africa CDC staff at different levels with a role-based account can view and interact with the dashboards and make necessary decisions based on the COVID-19 vaccination data from program implementation areas on the continent. The Africa CDC vaccination program dashboard provided essential information for public health officials to monitor the continental COVID-19 vaccination efforts and guide timely decisions. As the impact of COVID-19 is not yet over, the continental tracking of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and dashboard visualizations are used to provide the context of continental COVID-19 vaccination coverage and multiple other metrics that may impact the continental COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The lessons learned during the development and implementation of a continental COVID-19 vaccination tracking and visualization dashboard may be applied across various other public health events of continental and global concern.",Tajudeen R; Fallah MP; Ojo J; Shaweno T; Mekbib MS; Mulugeta F; Amanuel W; Bamatura M; Kibiye D; Kabwe PC; Sembuche S; Ngongo N; Dereje N; Kaseya J,"Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",PLOS digital health,2025-12-11,10.1371/journal.pdig.0000782,9.3,"visualization(title,abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(title,abstract)",
41364117,Uncovering Dental Caries Heterogeneity in NHANES Using Machine Learning.,"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), one of the largest curated repositories of population-level health indicators including physical examinations, blood/urine biochemistry, self-reported surveys, and dietary intake, offers rich resources for oral health research but presents challenges for machine learning analysis due to heterogeneity, missing data, and complexity. Dental caries, the most prevalent chronic disease worldwide, is a multifactorial disease and exhibits variability in clinical manifestation, calling for advanced analytical approaches for deeper understanding. Here, we develop an integrated data-cleaning and subtype discovery pipeline using unsupervised machine learning for comprehensive analysis and visualization of data patterns in the NHANES database. Our multidimensional pipeline declutters and optimizes the NHANES dataset by addressing missingness and outliers to streamline data integration and create a machine learning-ready version. Applying this pipeline reveals data patterns that led to the discovery of previously unrecognized subtypes and variables associated with the clinical heterogeneity of dental caries. We observed diverging patterns of similarity across age groups and variable subsets, identifying distinct clusters particularly in children (<5 y) and senior adults (>65 y). We also discovered unexpected associations involving lead exposure and specific laboratory markers and, importantly, identified novel dietary signatures by linking food type and co-occurring consumption patterns to caries. Altogether, we report a comprehensive data-processing and data-analysis approach that reveals significant dental caries heterogeneity in NHANES data and can support the development of more precise and robust machine learning models for dental caries and other health conditions.",Orlenko A; Mure JD; Gluch JI; Gregg J; Compher CW; Ren Z; Koo H; Moore JH,"Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, West Hollywood, CA, USA.",Journal of dental research,2025-12-09,10.1177/00220345251398027,8.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Cluster analysis; data mining; epidemiology; risk factors; Oral Health; Machine Learning
41370790,Development of a Hospital-at-Home Digital Twin for Patients With Frailty: Scoping Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Increasing demand on health care systems requires innovative, transformative solutions for efficient, high-quality care. One promising approach is digital twin (DT) technology, which leverages real-time data to create dynamic, virtual representations of a physical entity (individuals or space) to anticipate future scenarios and support care decisions. Although DTs have been explored in various sectors, their application in hospital at home (HaH), which delivers acute-level care in home environments, remains unexplored.<h4>Objective</h4>This review bridges a critical knowledge gap, examining existing evidence on DT-enabling tools to manage patients with frailty in home settings. This will identify the underpinning architectural components required to inform an HaH-DT system supporting clinical decision-making.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched 6 electronic databases and gray literature for primary English-language studies published between January 2019 and September 2025. Included studies reported on the monitoring or management of patients with frailty within their own home. Information was charted on a predefined data collection form to answer the research objectives. Review articles, protocols, and conference abstracts were excluded.<h4>Results</h4>We included 69 reports: 54% (37/69) used quantitative approaches, and 36% (25/69) were pilot or feasibility studies. Reports were analyzed for DT-enabling tools and systematically mapped across the proposed 5-layered DT architecture: sensing, communication, storage, analytics, and visualization. DT layer taxonomies, interconnections, and classifications of data types collected (eg, about the patient, home environment, use of medical equipment) are presented. This evidence identifies DT-enabling tools for a variety of functions and a range of sensing technologies (eg, wearable-based passive sensing, active physiological sensors, ambient sensors detecting motion or environmental changes). The most prevalent communication modes were wireless and network-based (36/112, 32.1%), the majority (12/36, 33%) using Bluetooth. Better understanding of data management, particularly secure storage, is required within local health care systems. The emerging potential of predictive and prescriptive analytics for risk prediction, clinical decision-making, or activation of alert-triggered health interventions by clinicians was mapped. Analytics methods are currently largely descriptive. Advanced methods such as prescriptive analytics for recommendations of an optimal course of action and diagnostic analytics that highlight why a situation has occurred are lacking. DT-enabling tools demonstrate patient-centered benefits, including enhanced motivation, reassurance, and personalized care. Concerns include device accuracy, user acceptability, and implications for carers and organizational workflows.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This review is among the first to systematically map DT-enabling tools to inform a potential HaH DT for patients with frailty, organized by a 5-layered conceptual model. Understanding these architectural layers provides the foundations for stakeholders to advance research and development in areas where there are knowledge gaps and consider how an HaH DT can effectively operate within current health care systems. Leveraging technology-enabled care in complex home-based settings provides great potential to deliver safer, personalized, timely care.",Yahya F; Cooper M; Saif W; Kassem M; Nazar H,"National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Newcastle Patient Safety Research Collaboration, Newcastle University, King George VI Building, King's Gate, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, United Kingdom, 44 1912086000.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-12-10,10.2196/81510,7.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw); machine learning(kw); data(abstract),Artificial intelligence; Frailty; Machine Learning; Risk Prediction; Digital Health; Hospital-at-home; Digital Twin
41361427,Systematic annotation and analysis of susceptibility genes associated with vaccine adverse events.,"Susceptibility genes, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DNA sequences, genetically predispose certain individuals to developing adverse events (AEs) following vaccination. Such AEs are often undetected in initial clinical safety trials during vaccine licensing evaluations. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of susceptibility genes is crucial for vaccine development, safety monitoring, and precision immunization. VaegenDB is a web-based centralized database and analysis system designed for managing, storing, and analyzing susceptibility genes associated with vaccine AEs. Basic information on these genes and supporting evidence are curated from peer-reviewed literature, while more detailed gene, AE, and vaccine data are automatically extracted from existing databases such as RefSeq and VIOLIN using in-house scripts. Currently, VaegenDB contains information on 160 susceptibility genes linked to 151 AEs and 86 vaccines. The system offers a user-friendly web interface that enables interactive querying and visualization of susceptibility genes. Bioinformatics analyses using VaegenDB reveal that a single susceptibility gene may harbor multiple genetic variations, one vaccine can be associated with several AEs, and a single AE may be influenced by multiple genes or SNPs. In addition, KEGG and GO enrichment analyses were employed to identify gene signatures-including functional annotations, mutation types, and expression patterns-associated with adverse reactions. The construction of this database and subsequent bioinformatics analyses help clarify enriched gene profiles and underlying mechanisms of vaccine-related AEs, thereby supporting rational vaccine design and advances in precision medicine.",Song Q; Su J; Pan C; Zhang X; Yang B; He Y; Xie J,"School of Life Health Information Science and Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 2 Chongwen Road, Nanan District, Chongqing, 400065, China.",BMC medical genomics,2025-12-08,10.1186/s12920-025-02292-4,7.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,abstract); informatics(kw,abstract)",Database; Vaccine; Bioinformatics analysis; Susceptibility gene; Ontology; Adverse Event; Precision Medicine
41389866,Toxicophore-informed machine learning integrating Tox21 assay readouts for organ system-specific carcinogenicity prediction.,"Accurate identification of carcinogenic hazards is essential for public health protection, yet traditional animal-based assays are time-consuming, expensive, and ethically challenging. Many existing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models predict overall carcinogenicity but often lack the organ-level specificity crucial for drug development and risk assessment. To fill this gap, we curated a high-quality dataset of 945 compounds based on mammalian carcinogenicity tests covering the endocrine, exocrine, hepatobiliary, respiratory, and urinary systems, and built machine learning-driven QSAR models integrating Tox21 bioactivity endpoints, descriptors (RDKit), and fingerprints (ECFP6, FCFP6, and MACCS) to capture mechanistic and structural drivers of organ-specific carcinogenic potential. Top performers, including CatBoost and neural networks, were trained using RDKit descriptors and combined descriptor-fingerprint feature sets, showing acceptable to good predictive ability (F1=0.68-0.88 and AUC=0.64-0.83). Feature importance analyses revealed that binary substructure fingerprints drive endocrine and respiratory predictions, while quantitative physicochemical descriptors dominate hepatobiliary and urinary models. Tox21 bioactivity endpoints, particularly CYP450 inhibition assays, ranked highly for exocrine carcinogenicity predictions, aligning with their role in xenobiotic metabolism. The top-performing models are accessible via a web dashboard, offering a rapid screening tool to prioritize chemicals for targeted in-depth evaluation and marking a significant advance in organ-specific carcinogenicity prediction.",Chen CY; Chou WC; Kamineni VN; Wu PY; Zhang Z; Wu X; Vulpe CD; Lin Z,"Department of Environmental and Global Health, College of Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, United States; Center for Environmental and Human Toxicology, University of Florida, FL 32611, United States.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2025-12-11,10.1016/j.envpol.2025.127519,6.6,"dashboard(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Carcinogenicity; Machine Learning; Organ System; Tox21; Feature Importance; Quantitative Structure−activity Relationship (Qsar)
41388315,Behavioral Economic and Staffing Strategies To Increase Adoption of the ABCDEF Bundle in the Intensive Care Unit (BEST ICU): study protocol for a multi-site stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial in the USA.,"<h4>Background</h4>Despite its proven safety and effectiveness at liberation from mechanical ventilation, ABCDEF (Assess, prevent, and manage pain; Both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials; Choice of analgesia/sedation; Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage; Early mobility/exercise; and Family engagement/empowerment) bundle performance in everyday intensive care unit (ICU) practice remains disappointingly low. This evidence-to-practice gap significantly contributes to the excessively high morbidity, mortality, costs, and disparities associated with current critical care delivery. This study will evaluate the effects of two discrete, behavioral economic, and implementation science-based strategies on ABCDEF bundle adoption and patient-centered outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>The Behavioral Economic and Staffing Strategies To Increase Adoption of the ABCDEF Bundle in the ICU (BEST-ICU) study is a three-arm pragmatic, stepped-wedged, cluster-randomized hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial aimed at detecting superiority of real-time audit and feedback (A&F) via an electronic dashboard versus registered nurse (RN) implementation facilitation on proportional ABCDEF bundle performance (primary implementation outcome), complete ABCDEF bundle performance (secondary outcome), and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (secondary outcome). The study will include 8100 patients admitted to 12 ICUs from 3 discrete safety net hospitals. Patients included will be ≥ 19 years old, admitted to a participating ICU for at least 24 h, and have received invasive mechanical ventilation during their ICU stay. All bundle performance and clinical outcome data on patients will be captured via institutional electronic health records (EHR). During the 27-month study, participating ICUs will be randomly assigned to either real-time A&F or an RN implementation facilitation using a two-step, stratified randomization process. At the study's end, both strategies will be removed (i.e., unless ICUs independently decide to continue the strategy), while implementation and clinical outcomes are followed for an additional 3 months, and key stakeholders' experiences with, and perspectives of, real-time A&F and RN implementation facilitation are explored.<h4>Discussion</h4>Using a novel study design while building upon currently available EHR technology and established patient-centered outcomes research network capability, the BEST ICU study will be the first translational research trial specifically aimed at developing and testing theory-based, clinician-informed, pragmatic, and potentially sustainable ABCDEF bundle implementation strategies.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06184945.

41383355,Enhanced Visualization of the Distal Myotomy Endpoint during Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy Using Indocyanine Green With Infrared Imaging.,"<h4>Background</h4>Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an effective treatment for achalasia; however, accurately identifying the distal extent of myotomy remains a technical challenge. Indocyanine green with infrared imaging (ICG-IRI) may facilitate the intraoperative visualization of the esophagogastric junction.<h4>Methods</h4>We evaluated 39 patients who underwent POEM using ICG-IRI. The primary outcome was the success rate of ICG-IRI, defined as a clear endoscopic visualization of fluorescence at the distal myotomy endpoint. The secondary outcomes included technical success, changes in integrated relaxation pressure, and Eckardt scores before and after treatment.<h4>Results</h4>The technical success rate was 100%, and ICG-IRI was successful in 94.9% of the cases (37/39). The median integrated relaxation pressure decreased from 26.9 to 10.8 mmHg, and the median Eckardt score improved from 5.0 to 1.0 (both <i>p</i> < 0.01). No adverse events were attributed to the ICG-IRI.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The ICG-IRI method is a reliable visual aid for identifying distal myotomy endpoints during POEM. This technique may enhance the procedural accuracy and improve clinical outcomes.",Ikebuchi Y; Sakaguchi T; Eizawa M; Mikamo T; Takemoto K; Fujii Y; Ogihara R; Kamitani Y; Edano M; Kinoshita H; Kurumi H; Hasegawa T; Kawaguchi K; Yashima K; Isomoto H,Department of Multidisciplinary Internal Medicine Division of Gastroenterology and Nephrology Tottori University Hospital Tottori Japan.,DEN open,2025-12-10,10.1002/deo2.70250,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Esophagus; Indocyanine green; Esophageal Achalasia; Esophageal Motility Disorders; Myotomy
41236319,[The Development of Algorithm of Intellectual System of Supporting Decision-Making in Mammographic Diagnostics of Breast Cancer Based on Convolutional Neuronic Network].,"The article considers issues of training models of convolutional neuronic network (CNN) for automated identification of point functions of visualization to discern mammography pictures belonging to negative, false benign and malignant cases, targeting to improve interpretation of results of mammographic examination. On the basis of automated deep training (application of CNN) the approach is proposed, that permits to detect small differences in mammographic pictures to diagnose true positive and false positive results. The information base for training CNN is represented by digital base (open resource for methods of intellectual studying of analysis of mammographic pictures) of data of mammography screening of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Winston-Salem Medical College, the USA. The share of false positive results according trained model in the total number of examined patients from different age groups made up from 22% to 32%. To compare, share of false positive results based on decoding of mammographic picture by medical specialist varied from 34% to 53%. The trained model based on the CNN can be used for mammographic pictures of any database. The predictive accuracy of model depends, among other things, on volume of training sample. Therefore, formation of open database of results of mammographic examinations with accurately established diagnosis will permit later on to broadly apply possibilities of deep training in medical practice. The study has great potential to incorporate deep training of CNN into clinical practice of screening of breast cancer and to improve interpretation of mammographic pictures.",Osmanov EM; Tuktamysheva LM; Manyakov RR; Pivovarova KV; Garaeva AS; Korkmazova LH; Drepin VV; Zubayraeva YS,"The Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education ""The I.

41370628,Visualizing Anatomy: Comparing the Pedagogical Impact of Chalkboard Teaching and 3D Models.,"Effective anatomy education is critical for preparing medical students for clinical tasks such as surgical planning and radiological interpretation. Traditional chalkboard teaching and modern 3D printed models offer distinct approaches, yet their comparative pedagogical impact remains underexplored. This study evaluates chalkboard, 3D printed model, and hybrid teaching methods to optimize anatomy learning for clinical applications like coronary artery mapping and neurosurgery planning. A quasi-experimental study involved 120 undergraduate medical students randomly assigned to three groups (n = 40 each) for a 15-week intervention: chalkboard (lectures with 2D diagrams), 3D printed models (hands-on learning with patient-specific models, e.g., 3D printed heart for angioplasty), and hybrid (integrating both, model-first sequence). Outcomes were assessed via a 20-item anatomy quiz (skeletal, cardiovascular, neuroanatomy, muscular domains), a 30-item pre- and post-activity questionnaire (5-point Likert scale, knowledge, engagement, clarity), qualitative interviews (n = 28, hybrid group), and the Pedagogical Visualization Index (PVI). Data were analyzed using ANOVA, paired t-tests, and thematic analysis. The hybrid group outperforms others, with superior knowledge gain (81.8%, p < 0.001), engagement (4.4 ± 0.4), clarity (4.6 ± 0.3), and PVI (0.830) compared to 3D models (PVI: 0.720) and chalkboard (PVI: 0.543), excelling in cardiovascular (84%, e.g., coronary artery mapping) and neuroanatomy (85%, e.g., cranial nerve localization). Model-first sequencing enhances outcomes (PVI: 0.86, p = 0.03). Qualitative themes (78%) emphasize visualization for clinical reasoning (e.g., femoral artery mapping for vascular surgery). Additionally, the hybrid method demonstrates versatility across specialties, with students achieving high clarity (4.7 ± 0.2) in neurosurgery (e.g., optic nerve tracing for aneurysm clipping), precision (88%) in radiology (e.g., lung segmentation for pulmonary embolism), and engagement (4.6 ± 0.2) in orthopedics (e.g., ACL reconstruction), supported by tactile feedback from 3D models like the knee and congenital heart models for pediatric surgery (clarity 4.9 ± 0.1). The hybrid method, leveraging 3D printed models, optimizes anatomy learning for clinical tasks, supporting adoption in resource-limited curricula.

41378271,Optimizing Revision Lumbar Surgery: The Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic Approach.,"Background Revision lumbar surgery is technically challenging due to postoperative scarring, altered anatomy, and high complication risks. Conventional open revisions cause more tissue damage and slower recovery. The Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic (UBE) technique, offering improved visualization and maneuverability, may enhance safety and outcomes in revision procedures. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the UBE technique in managing complex lumbar revision surgeries. Methodology A retrospective analysis was conducted on 10 patients who underwent revision lumbar surgery using the UBE technique between February 2022 and February 2024. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Complications and patient satisfaction were also evaluated. Results Significant reductions in pain and disability were observed postoperatively. The mean preoperative VAS scores for leg and back pain decreased from 8.1 to 0.8 and from 7.5 to 1.7, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean ODI score improved from 67.5 to 17.5 (p < 0.001). No major complications occurred, and 70% of patients reported excellent satisfaction. Conclusion UBE is a safe and effective minimally invasive approach for complex lumbar revision surgeries. It provides substantial pain relief, functional recovery, and low complication rates. By preserving soft tissues and offering superior visualization, UBE shows promise as an advanced alternative to conventional revision techniques.",Maaya A; Hwa Eum J,"Neurosurgery, Ain Al Khaleej Hospital, Al Ain, ARE.",Cureus,2025-12-08,10.7759/cureus.98707,4.5,"visualization(abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Spinal cord; Visual Analog Scale; Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic; Minimally Invasive And Robotic Spine Surgery; Revision Of Surgery
41385819,Optimization of the reconstruction kernel for temporal bone imaging using photon-counting detector CT: A combined physical and visual evaluation.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) offers superior spatial resolution and noise characteristics compared to conventional CT. However, optimal reconstruction parameters for temporal bone imaging, especially kernel selection, remain unclear. This study aimed to identify the optimal reconstruction kernel using both objective physical image quality metrics and subjective expert assessments.<h4>Methods</h4>In phantom experiments, the system performance function (SPF) based on the task-based transfer function (TTF) and noise power spectrum (NPS) was calculated across 11 reconstruction kernels (Hr60-Hr98). Based on the results of the physical evaluation and clinical considerations from clinical practice, a subset of kernels was selected for visual assessment. For clinical images, two diagnostic radiologists evaluated three fine anatomical structures (i.e., stapes footplate, incudomalleolar joint, and cochlea) and overall image quality using both a ranking method and a 5-point Likert scale.<h4>Results</h4>TTF analysis indicated that Hr96 had the highest spatial resolution, while Hr60 showed the lowest noise in the NPS. SPF analysis identified Hr72 as providing the optimal balance between resolution and noise. Visual assessment using four reconstruction kernels (Hr60, Hr72, Hr76, and Hr84) showed that Hr76 consistently received the highest preference for overall image quality and visualization of fine structures. Statistically significant differences were observed among the kernels, with Hr60 consistently rated the lowest (p < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The kernel Hr76 was found suitable for middle and inner ear diagnoses using PCD-CT, providing a good balance between spatial resolution and image noise. This finding provides a foundation for standardized reconstruction protocols in high-resolution temporal bone imaging.<h4>Implications for practice</h4>These findings support the use of Hr76 as a standard kernel for high-resolution temporal bone imaging and may contribute to protocol optimization in clinical PCD-CT practice.",Nishii S; Asahara T; Morimitsu Y; Kajisaki S; Akagi N; Honda M; Hayashi H; Sugaya A; Munetomo K; Higaki F; Hiraki T; Iguchi T,"Graduate School of Health Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.

41364580,Deep Learning-based Surrogate Model of Subject-Specific Finite-Element Analysis for Vertebrae.,"Subject-specific finite-element analysis (FEA) models enable accurate simulation of vertebral biomechanics but are often time-consuming to construct and solve under varying conditions. This study presents a novel deep learning (DL)/machine learning (ML)-based surrogate model that predicts stress distributions in vertebral bodies with high efficiency. The model integrates vertebral shape encoding and employs separate decoding branches for surface and internal nodes. It was trained on 3,960 synthetic L1 vertebrae generated via data augmentation from 42 real computed tomography (CT) scans. Evaluation on independent test samples yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0596 MPa and an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.864 for von Mises stress. Visualization results confirm strong agreement between predicted and FEA-computed stress patterns, with localized discrepancies observed at the anteroinferior margin and pedicles. Moreover, an end-to-end automated pipeline was established based on the developed model, reducing the total processing time from 90-120 min to approximately 134-154 s per subject. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed surrogate model to facilitate rapid, subject-specific biomechanical assessments in clinical workflows.",Cai Y; Dall'Ara E; Lacroix D; Guo L,,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2025-12-09,10.1109/tbme.2025.3642160,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(abstract),
41385043,Enhanced forecasting of air quality index through an integrated deep learning framework.,"Accurate air quality forecasting is vital for public health, urban planning, and environmental policy. Traditional models often fail to capture the complex temporal, spatial, and topological dependencies inherent in air quality data. This study presents a hybrid deep learning model that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for sequential prediction, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction, and graph neural networks (GNNs) for modeling spatial correlations between monitoring stations. To further enhance prediction robustness, ensemble learning techniques-stacking and boosting-are employed to fuse the outputs of individual models. The model is evaluated using real-world datasets from air quality monitoring agencies, covering multiple pollutants and meteorological parameters. Experimental results show significant improvements in performance metrics, achieving R<sup>2</sup> scores exceeding 0.92 and reduced prediction errors compared to baseline models. Visualization of predicted vs. actual AQI values and residuals confirms the model's accuracy and consistency. Specifically, the hybrid model achieved an MAE of 11.30, RMSE of 15.60, and R<sup>2</sup> of 0.89 on the Beijing dataset, outperforming standalone LSTM (MAE 14.55, R<sup>2</sup> 0.80), CNN (MAE 15.12, R<sup>2</sup> 0.78), and GNN (MAE 13.67, R<sup>2</sup> 0.83). In cross-dataset evaluation, the model attained an MAE of 12.62 and R<sup>2</sup> of 0.85 when trained on Beijing and tested on Los Angeles, confirming its robustness and transferability. The proposed framework demonstrates strong generalizability and interpretability, making it a promising tool for environmental monitoring and decision-making in pollution-sensitive regions.",Raja S; Damodaran A; Manohar G,"Department of Mechanical Engineeeing, Easwari Engineeeing College, Chennai - 600 089, Tamil Nadu, India. sudha.r@eec.srmrmp.edu.in.",Environmental science and pollution research international,2025-12-12,10.1007/s11356-025-37269-4,4.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Long Short-term Memory (Lstm); Air Quality Index (Aqi) Forecasting; Spatiotemporal Data Analysis; Graph Neural Networks (Gnn); Hybrid Deep Learning Models
41365144,A novel virtual patient approach for cross-patient multimodal fusion in enhanced breast cancer detection.,"Multimodal medical imaging combining conventional imaging modalities such as mammography, ultrasound, and histopathology has shown significant promise for improving breast cancer detection accuracy. However, clinical implementation faces substantial challenges due to incomplete patient-matched multimodal datasets and resource constraints. Traditional approaches require complete imaging workups from individual patients, limiting their practical applicability. This study investigates whether cross-patient multimodal fusion combining imaging modalities from different patients, can provide additional diagnostic information beyond single-modality approaches. We hypothesize that leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous patient populations enhances cancer detection performance, even when modalities originate from separate individuals. We developed a novel virtual patient framework that systematically combines imaging modalities across different patients based on quality-driven selection strategies. Two training paradigms were evaluated: Fixed scenario with 1:1:1 cross-patient combinations (∼250 virtual patients), and Combinatorial scenario with systematic companion selection (∼20,000 virtual patients). Multiple fusion architectures (concatenation, attention, and averaging) were assessed, and we designed a novel co-attention mechanism that enables sophisticated cross-modal interaction through learned attention weights. These fusion networks were evaluated using histopathology (BCSS), mammography, and ultrasound (BUSI) datasets. External validation using the ICIAR2018 BACH Challenge dataset as an alternative histopathology source demonstrated the generalizability of our approach, achieving promising accuracy despite differences in staining protocols and acquisition procedures across institutions. All models were evaluated on consistent fixed test sets to ensure fair comparison. This dataset is well-suited for multiple breast cancer analysis tasks, including detection, segmentation, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) applications. Cross-patient multimodal fusion demonstrated significant improvements over single-modality approaches. The best single modality achieved 75.36% accuracy (mammography), while the optimal fusion combination (histopathology-mammography) reached 97.10% accuracy, representing a 21.74 percentage point improvement. Comprehensive quantitative validation through silhouette analysis (score: 0.894) confirms that the observed performance improvements reflect genuine feature space structure rather than visualization artifacts. Cross-patient multimodal fusion demonstrates significant potential for enhancing breast cancer detection, particularly addressing real-world scenarios where complete patient-matched multimodal data is unavailable. This approach represents a paradigm shift toward leveraging heterogeneous information sources for improved diagnostic performance.",Akbari Y; Abdullakutty F; Al-Maadeed S; Saady RA; Bouridane A; Hamoudi R,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, 2713, Qatar.

39564907,"Quantification of Interstitial Lung Diseases, From the &lt;i&gt;AJR&lt;/i&gt; Special Series on Quantitative Imaging.","High-resolution CT (HRCT) plays an important role in diagnosing and monitoring interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Despite advances, predicting disease progression and treatment response remains challenging. HRCT enables noninvasive visualization and classification of patterns of lung injury and assessment of disease extent. Visual estimation of CT extent of fibrotic lung disease is an independent predictor of mortality and progression but is subjective, with only modest interobserver agreement for radiologic interpretation of ILD. Machine learning-based textural analyses of fibrosis extent on baseline and serial HRCT scans show robust correlations with physiologic measures and strong association with risk of disease progression or mortality across various fibrosing ILDs. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, quantitative CT (QCT) assessment is associated with physiologic impairment and risk of progression and death, and increasing severity of fibrosis on longitudinal evaluation is associated with increased risk of progression and death. Similar results have been noted for fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and connective tissue disease. This review focuses on QCT techniques for ILDs. We describe the clinical need for quantification of lung disease and illustrate the role of conventional visual evaluation and of QCT approaches in defining disease severity, prognosis, and longitudinal progression, both in established disease and in preclinical interstitial abnormalities.",Humphries SM; Chung A; Swigris JJ; Oh AS; Walsh SLF; Lynch DA; Goldin JG; Kim GHJ,"Department of Radiology, National Jewish Health, 1400 Jackson St, Rm F102B, Denver, CO 80206.",AJR.

41382018,"Characteristics and economic burden of hospitalized tuberculosis patients in Guangdong Province, China, from 2017 to 2023: a population-based study.","<h4>Background</h4>Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a leading global health issue, especially in developing countries. In China, tuberculosis prevention efforts have increased, but the disease still imposes significant economic burdens. Guangdong Province, with its dense population and high mobility, faces substantial challenges in tuberculosis control. This study analyzes hospitalization costs and influencing factors to improve resource allocation and policy-making.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study analyzed the data from the first page of medical records in Guangdong Province, including Tuberculosis patients hospitalized in Guangdong Province from 2017 to 2023. Data covered demographics, hospitalization details, and regional classification. Statistical methods included normality tests, chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H tests, and visualization tools such as Sankey charts. Structural variation and new gray relational analyses assessed the relationship between changes in hospitalization costs and each individual cost. Multivariate regression analyzed significant variables affecting costs, and the Prophet model predicted future trends by fitting cost data from 2017 to 2023.<h4>Result</h4>The study included 410,484 hospitalization records of tuberculosis patients, with a median cost per hospitalization of 8,548.30 RMB. The Pearl River Delta region had higher healthcare costs and longer hospital stays, possibly due to more comorbidity patients. Structural variation analysis and new gray correlation analysis showed that diagnostic and western medicine fees had the main contribution to changes in hospitalization costs. Multivariate regression analysis showed that hospital class drug resistance and surgery were the main factors affecting hospitalization costs. The Prophet model predicted that hospitalization costs would decrease over the next three years due to improved Tuberculosis control measures and policy adjustments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study reveals the economic burden and regional differences of hospitalized Tuberculosis patients in Guangdong Province. Diagnostic costs and western drug costs are the main factors contributing to changes in hospitalization costs, with hospital class, drug resistance and surgery being the main influences, while hospitalization costs will decline over the next three years. Therefore, investing in primary care to improve local healthcare access, empowering providers to manage tuberculosis effectively, optimizing treatment policies, expanding health insurance coverage, and enhancing drug-resistant patient treatment are critical to reducing financial burdens and improving tuberculosis control.",Li S; Xue Y; Meng X; Liu G; Yuan S; Chen L; Wang X; Zhang D; Zhou L,"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, 74th Zhongshan Road II, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510080, China.",BMC infectious diseases,2025-12-11,10.1186/s12879-025-12292-5,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Tuberculosis; Influencing factors; Guangdong province; Time Trends; Structural Variation; Economic Burden

This study evaluates the implementation of Complete Anatomy, a three-dimensional anatomy platform, within an early-year medical curriculum. A mixed-methods design was used to collect student and staff data through surveys and focus groups. Student responses showed selective use focused on visualization tools, with limited engagement with quizzes and annotation features. Staff reported low familiarity and minimal use in teaching. Reported barriers included technical instability, navigation difficulty, and lack of integration with learning outcomes. Students and staff proposed curriculum actions to support platform use, including onboarding during induction, guided tasks in tutorials, tutor modeling, and alignment with block content. These actions respond to operational constraints and support structured adoption. The findings provide a framework for platform-specific implementation that may improve consistency of use and reduce cognitive burden.

41372297,Segmental body BIA device development for fracture detection.,"Bone fractures are a major health issue worldwide, often requiring diagnostic tools like X-rays or CT scans, which, despite their effectiveness, present drawbacks such as radiation exposure, high cost, and limited accessibility. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel, low-cost, portable, and non-invasive segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device based on the AD5933 impedance converter. The device was designed using a four-electrode configuration and integrates an ARM7 LPC2138 microcontroller, signal conditioning circuits, and a user-friendly LCD display for real-time data visualization. It operates at a fixed frequency of 50 kHz to measure impedance and phase angle variations in the human knee during fracture and healing stages. Validation was conducted using standard resistive and capacitive components, yielding measurement errors typically under 7%, thereby confirming its technical reliability. Clinical validation involved data collection of 125 patients with fractures, out of which 20 knee fracture patients are follow up, where clear differences in impedance and phase angle were observed before and after healing. These findings highlight the system's potential for real-time monitoring of bone healing, offering a reliable and accessible alternative to conventional imaging technologies, especially beneficial in rural and point of care settings.",Brajesh K; Aldobali M; Pal K; Khan M,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Gautam Buddha University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.

41361938,Ocular Morphology and Clinical Ophthalmic Parameters of Nile Tilapia Oreochromis niloticus.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To describe the ocular morphological characteristics and establish clinical and ophthalmic reference standards for Nile tilapia.<h4>Animals studied</h4>Fresh carcasses were used for diaphanization, optical and electron microscopy, and computed tomography analyses. For clinical and ultrasonographic evaluations, 75 adult Nile tilapias of undetermined sex were examined.<h4>Procedure</h4>Standard diaphanization, optical and electron microscopy, and computed tomography techniques were applied to fresh carcasses of Nile tilapia. Live fish were chemically restrained using propofol. Ophthalmic evaluations included slit-lamp biomicroscopy, direct ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein staining, and rebound tonometry for intraocular pressure measurement. Ocular ultrasonographic measurements were obtained from both eyes of three individuals.<h4>Results</h4>The diaphanization technique revealed a scleral ring composed of two cartilaginous ossicles (dorsal and ventral) connected by two bony ossicles (rostral and caudal). Microscopic analysis identified the fibrous tunic (comprising the cornea and sclera), the vascular tunic (including the iris and choroid), and the nervous tunic (represented by the retina). Clinical evaluation of Nile tilapia showed no ocular lesions, with a mean intraocular pressure of 7.74 mmHg. Ultrasonography effectively assessed intraocular and retrobulbar structures, while computed tomography enabled visualization and measurement of the eyeballs, lens, and vitreous chamber in sagittal, axial, and coronal planes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The ocular structures of Nile tilapia, including the cornea, lens, retina, and iris, are similar to those observed in other teleost species. Clinical evaluation methods, such as ultrasonography, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and rebound tonometry appear to be reliable diagnostic methods in fish ophthalmology.

41364977,Band-limited implicit neural representations for diffusion-weighted imaging denoising.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>&#xD;Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has significant value in disease diagnosis and treatment response monitoring, but its inherent low signal-to-noise ratio severely affects image quality and quantification accuracy. Existing denoising techniques often blur important tissue boundary information when suppressing noise.&#xD;&#xD;Methods:&#xD;This study proposes a band-limited implicit neural representation (BL-INR) framework for DWI denoising. The method introduces band-limited positional encoding based on the frequency response characteristics of the sinc function to restrict INR models from learning high-frequency noise while maintaining strong signal representation capabilities. Furthermore, multi-b-value DWI and structural MRI from the same patient are integrated as anatomical priors, exploiting the correlation between true signals and the statistical independence of noise to achieve effective denoising.&#xD;&#xD;Main Results:&#xD;In clinical DWI data evaluation across 4 anatomical regions (brain, head and neck, abdomen, and pelvis), BL-INR's visualization results were superior to existing methods. Under extremely low signal-to-noise ratio conditions (SNR=1) in simulated noise experiments, BL-INR achieved a PSNR of 35.44 and SSIM of 0.933, significantly outperforming other methods. Phantom denoising results showed that BL-INR achieved an average ADC value error of only 4.57 × 10^-5 mm^2/s, the smallest among all methods.&#xD;&#xD;Significance:&#xD;BL-INR provides a novel approach for DWI denoising by limiting the frequency of INR input positional encoding. Its self-supervised learning characteristics require no paired training data and allow convenient clinical application. The method enables the derivation of accurate diffusion parameters, providing a reliable foundation for DWI-based quantitative analysis with significant clinical application value.",Li Y; Dai Y; Liao YP; Deng J; Zhang Y,"Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 2280 Inwood Rd, Dallas, Texas, 75390-9096, UNITED STATES.",Physics in medicine and biology,2025-12-09,10.1088/1361-6560/ae2a9e,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Denoising; Diffusion-weighted Imaging; Self-supervised Learning; Implicit Neural Representation
41365825,Can full-volume Dual-energy CT Quantitative Parameter Nomogram Predict the new IASLC Grade of Pure Solid Invasive Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to develop and construct a predictive model based on the quantitative parameters of full-volume dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to forecast the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification of non-mucinous invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma (IPA).<h4>Methods</h4>The preoperative clinical and imaging data of 161 patients with pure solid type non-mucinous IPA from September 2021 to May 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. The semiautomated software was used to perform full-volume segmentation of the lesions and the associated DECT quantitative parameters were recorded. Through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, we identified independent characteristic variables that distinguished high-grade from low-grade non-mucinous IPA. We subsequently used these characteristic variables to construct a multiparameter model.<h4>Results</h4>Volume, slope of the spectral curve (λ40keV-100keV) and normalized iodine concentration (NIC) were identified as independent feature variables to distinguish low-grade and high-grade non-mucinous IPA. By utilizing these three variables, we constructed a quantitative visualization nomogram to distinguish the new IASLC grade of non-mucinous IPA. The model exhibited excellent performance in both the training and testing groups, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.884 (95% CI: 0.826-0.943) and 0.848 (95% CI: 0.738-0.958), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study successfully established and validated a nomogram based on DECT quantitative parameters, which can effectively differentiate high-grade and low-grade non-mucinous IPA and provides potential value for clinical decision-making.<h4>Advances in knowledge</h4>This study is the first attempt to apply a nomogram based on DECT to assess the invasiveness of non-mucous IPA.",Liu K; Fang N; Cao Y; Gao Y; Xu Y; Zhu Y; Xie X,"Department of Radiology, Nanjing Medical University Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.",The British journal of radiology,2025-12-09,10.1093/bjr/tqaf303,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Nomogram; Dual-energy Computed Tomography; Invasive Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma; Iaslc Grade
41372720,"A Comparative Evaluation of Zero-Shot Performance of SAM, SAM2, MedSAM, and MedSAM2 Models on Lung Segmentation.","Lung diseases require accurate and early diagnosis to ensure effective treatment planning and close monitoring of disease progression. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) provides detailed visualization of lung structures, while automated lung segmentation in HRCT images supports the diagnostic process and improves clinical accuracy. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the segmentation performance of Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM2, Medical SAM (MedSAM), and MedSAM2 models within a zero-shot learning framework, using the MedGIFT database as the experimental benchmark. Notably, no retraining or fine-tuning was applied to the models, thereby enabling an objective assessment of segmentation performance as a function of prompt types. In the conducted experiments, bounding box (BB) prompts were automatically derived from the ground truth masks, while point-based prompts were generated with positive-only, negative-only, and combined strategies. The number of points varied between 1 and 10, with selections made both randomly and in a balanced manner across lung regions. Experimental findings revealed that, contrary to initial expectations, earlier model versions (SAM and MedSAM) outperformed their newer counterparts (SAM2 and MedSAM2) in BB-based segmentation tasks. Regarding point-based prompts, SAM and SAM2 exhibited complementary strengths: SAM2 achieved higher accuracy with fewer input points, whereas SAM demonstrated superior performance with more densely labeled scenarios. Disease-specific analysis showed point-based prompting was most effective in tuberculosis, while BB-based prompts performed poorly; pulmonary fibrosis had the lowest overall segmentation performance. The highest Dice obtained were 96.076% for SAM, 92.912% for SAM2, 94.326% for MedSAM, and 84.979% for MedSAM2. These results underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate model and prompting strategy based on labeling density and disease characteristics. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the SAM model family for computed tomography lung segmentation on the MedGIFT database, demonstrating their potential as flexible and robust tools for clinical use. Moreover, this study highlights prompt selection as a key determinant of SAM-based segmentation performance in clinical lung imaging.",Buyukpatpat H; Sezer EA; Guzel MS,"Department of Computer Engineering, Bartin University, Bartin, 74100, Turkey. hbuyukpatpat@bartin.edu.tr.",Journal of imaging informatics in medicine,2025-12-10,10.1007/s10278-025-01778-y,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Medical imaging; Lung Segmentation; Deep Learning; Zero-shot Learning; Segment Anything Model (Sam)
41361512,Combined endoscopic and robotic-assisted transcolonic polypectomy as a novel technique for challenging polyp resection.,"<h4>Background</h4>Colonoscopic resection of adenomatous polyps reduces mortality from colorectal cancer, which remains the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Most polyps can be removed endoscopically by cold snare resection, endoscopic mucosal resection, or endoscopic submucosal dissection. However, technically challenging polyps often require partial colectomy, which confers increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Emerging hybrid approaches such as combined endoscopic-laparoscopic techniques have been developed to manage benign, complex colonic polyps and reduce the need for surgical resection.<h4>Objective</h4>Patients with SLD completed a 14-item questionnaire that assigned barriers to healthy eating to three categories: lack of knowledge, lack of self-control, and lack of time, with a higher summary score indicating more perceived barriers. We administered assessments of health literacy and physical activity. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and ordinal regression analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>A hybrid approach integrating endoscopic visualization via colonoscope with robotic-assisted transcolonic access was performed to achieve complete polypectomy in a patient with a technically challenging, benign colonic lesion and a past surgical history of extended right colectomy. The technique was evaluated in terms of feasibility, adequacy of resection, and operative considerations.<h4>Results</h4>The combined endoscopic and robotic-assisted approach successfully enabled complete resection of a benign, complex colonic polyp that had previously failed endoscopic submucosal dissection. The procedure was performed without significant complications and allowed for reduced operative time and anticipated shorter recovery as compared to partial colectomy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This case demonstrates that combined endoscopic and robotic-assisted transcolonic polypectomy is a safe, feasible, minimally invasive alternative for select complex, benign colonic polyps. This novel technique may reduce the need for partial colectomy and associated morbidity, offering a promising option for managing challenging lesions, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities and high operative risk.",Nghiem E; Zigouras S; Yu H; Adkisson C; Wiltz O; Taylor J,"Department of Surgery, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA. emily.nghiem@einsteinmed.edu.",Surgical endoscopy,2025-12-08,10.1007/s00464-025-12445-2,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Colorectal Cancer; minimally invasive surgery; Combined Endoscopic-laparoscopic Surgery; Combined Endoscopic-robotic Surgery; Robotic-assisted Polypectomy; Transcolonic Polypectomy
41390731,Physical performance outweighs grip strength in predicting diabetes risk: evidence from a prospective cohort study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Diabetes represents a growing global public health burden. Traditional risk assessments based on static metabolic markers may not adequately reflect underlying mechanisms such as insulin resistance. As the primary site of glucose disposal, skeletal muscle may offer additional insight through functional assessments. However, the predictive value of muscle function indicators, including grip strength and the five-times chair stand test (5-CST), remains uncertain.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective cohort study comprised 6,604 participants drawn from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), with follow-up data collected from 2011 to 2020. Muscle strength and physical performance were assessed at baseline using grip strength and 5-CST, respectively. New-onset diabetes was identified through self-report of physician diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between muscle function indicators and new-onset diabetes, adjusting for potential confounders. Subgroup and interaction analyses were performed by age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). Nomograms and Sankey diagrams were used for data visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 6,604 participants, 3,020 were male (45.7%) and 3,584 were female (54.3%), with a median age of 58 years (IQR: 51-65). Low muscle strength was identified in 605 participants (9.2%), and low physical performance in 2,025 (30.7%). Low physical performance was associated with an elevated risk of new-onset diabetes (HR 1.354, 95% CI 1.174-1.561; p < 0.001), which persisted after multivariable adjustment (HR 1.219, 95% CI 1.052-1.414; p = 0.008). This association was stronger in participants aged 40-49 years (HR 1.835, 95% CI 1.249-2.696; p = 0.002), and those with BMI < 25 kg/m² (HR 1.528, 95% CI 1.266-1.845; p < 0.001). Although each 1-second longer 5-CST time was linked to a 2.6% higher risk before adjustment (HR 1.026, p < 0.001), this continuous association was not significant after full adjustment. Neither absolute nor relative grip strength showed independent associations with diabetes risk.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Physical performance surpasses grip strength as a predictor of new-onset diabetes, particularly in middle-aged and non-obese individuals. As a brief, low-resource assessment of lower-limb performance, it provides a practical and scalable tool for identifying high-risk individuals, especially young lean adults who are often missed by traditional risk models.",Zhu M; Zhu Q; Liu H; Du R; Cao J; Chen N; Liu T; Zhang T; Han T; Weng Y; Xiang M; Hu P; Yan Y; Huang R; Hu Y,"Department of Geriatrics, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.",Journal of translational medicine,2025-12-13,10.1186/s12967-025-07473-4,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Diabetes mellitus; Insulin resistance; Risk factor; Physical performance; Muscle Strength
41372629,An Adjustable Smart Ring to Monitor Pulse Rate and Peripheral Blood Oxygen Saturation.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Smart rings are emerging as a promising solution in the field of wearable devices, offering a compact and ergonomic solution for continuous physiological monitoring, yet one of their major limitations is that they are not adjustable, but rather come in different sizes. Another major gap in the literature is the lack of validation data during dynamic activities. This study presents the design, development, and validation under static and controlled-motion conditions of a research-grade adjustable smart ring for tracking pulse rate (PR) and peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) using photoplethysmography.<h4>Methods</h4>The device features a rigid-flex printed circuit board (PCB) optimized for finger placement, ensuring accurate sensor positioning, and adaptability to different sizes. Data transmission occurs via the ANT protocol, allowing real-time visualization on a mobile application. The smart ring was evaluated on 30 healthy volunteers (13 women and 17 men, mean age 27.5 ± 7.4 years, mean height 172.2 ± 9.0 cm, mean weight 68.1 ± 13.1 kg) through a multi-phase experimental protocol involving spontaneous breathing, apnea, and physical activity, with measurements compared against a gold-standard pulse oximeter.<h4>Results</h4>Results demonstrate strong agreement in PR measurements both in static and dynamic conditions (r = 0.91, p < 0.001), while SpO₂ values exhibited an overestimation (mean bias = 1.04%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This work demonstrates the feasibility of an adjustable, research-grade smart ring based on a rigid-flex PCB for finger palmar PR and SpO₂ monitoring and quantifies its agreement with a clinical-grade fingertip oximeter in healthy adults in static and dynamic conditions. The device is conceived primarily as a hardware and measurement site platform that can be reused across ring sizes, while future work is needed to develop open signal-processing algorithms.",Montenegro M; Aliverti A; Angelucci A,"Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy.",Annals of biomedical engineering,2025-12-10,10.1007/s10439-025-03936-3,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Physical Activity; Photoplethysmography; Pulse Rate; Wearable; Smart Ring
41386310,Emerging insights into traditional Chinese medicine interventions for chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.,"<h4>Ethnopharmacological relevance</h4>Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity (CIC) is a serious and potentially life-threatening adverse effect associated with various chemotherapeutic agents, which has become the second leading cause of mortality among cancer survivors, following only the malignancy itself. However, effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for CIC remain limited. Accumulating evidence suggests that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) holds considerable promise in mitigating CIC through multiple pathways. However, research findings in this field are currently fragmented and lack systematic integration.<h4>Aim of the study</h4>To provide a comprehensive understanding of the current research status, emerging hotspots, developmental trends, and key challenges in the field of TCM interventions for CIC.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A systematic literature search was conducted using the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Web of Science databases from January 1, 2000, to December 30, 2024. CiteSpace software was employed for visualization and knowledge mapping, enabling an in-depth analysis of research hotspots and trends in TCM interventions for CIC.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 532 relevant articles were retrieved, with the number of publications showing an increasing trend over the past two decades. Core authors such as Xie Ming, Ji Xuming, and Fu Chaomei, along with institutions like Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, have played leading roles in this field. Co-occurrence and clustering of keywords revealed several core research domains, including tumor types associated with CIC, chemotherapeutic agents inducing CIC, and pharmacological mechanisms of TCM interventions. Burst keywords and timeline analyses highlighted emerging research hotspots and developmental trends, such as enhancing efficacy, reducing toxicity, and elucidating underlying mechanism, reflecting a shift toward mechanistic exploration and clinical translation. The article further discusses various TCM therapies-including classical TCM formulas, modern TCM formulas, single herbs, active compounds and injections-in alleviating CIC, as well as modern pharmacological insights and the current challenges in this field.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Over the past two decades, interest in TCM interventions for CIC has grown significantly. Current research hotspots focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms of CIC and emerging evidence supports the potential of multi-target TCM interventions as a strategy to mitigate CIC. However, key challenges remain, future research should prioritize the discovery of novel TCM candidates, in-depth mechanistic investigations, and the implementation of high-quality clinical trials to support evidence-based application of TCM in CIC prevention and treatment.",Li J; Zhang Z; Xu D; Fu R; Gong Z; Tang Y; Chen Y,"Key Laboratory of Shaanxi Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for TCM Compatibility, Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xi'an, 712046, China; Wuxi Institute of Chinese and Western Integrative Medicine, and Wuxi Cancer Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi, 214062, China.

While robotic platforms provide enhanced dexterity, three-dimensional visualization, and improved ergonomics, these theoretical benefits must be balanced against longer operative times and substantially higher costs. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic IPOM repair for ventral hernias.<h4>Methods</h4>This systematic review and meta-analysis were prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD ID: CRD420251146940). We searched multiple databases, MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and Google Scholar from inception to 8th September 2025 for randomized controlled trials comparing robotic versus laparoscopic IPOM repair in adults with primary or incisional ventral hernias. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool, and evidence certainty was evaluated using the GRADE methodology. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager.<h4>Results</h4>Three randomized controlled trials comprising 236 patients (122 robotic, 114 laparoscopic) were included. Robotic repair was associated with significantly longer operative time (mean difference: 62.60 min, 95% CI: 50.23-74.98, p < 0.00001, moderate certainty evidence). No significant differences were observed in overall postoperative complications (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.54-2.36, low certainty due to imprecision and small study effects), length of hospital stay (mean difference: -0.02 days, 95% CI: -0.32 to 0.27, low certainty), readmission rates (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.08-2.70, very low ), reoperation rates (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.03-2.92, very low ), conversion to open surgery (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.22-3.83, low certainty), or hernia recurrence at 12-24 months follow-up (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.26-3.63, low certainty).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Current randomized evidence demonstrates that robotic IPOM repair requires longer operative time than laparoscopic repair but shows no significant differences in short-term safety outcomes or long-term efficacy. Larger, high-quality randomized trials are needed to establish definitive recommendations.",Mirza W; Khan ME; Iqbal H; Moeen-Ud-Din MB; Dadan S; Khan HM,"Shifa College of Medicine, Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University, Sector H-8/4, Islamabad, Pakistan. wajahatmirza.clinicalresearch@gmail.com.",Journal of robotic surgery,2025-12-08,10.1007/s11701-025-03010-z,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Meta-analysis; Laparoscopic surgery; Systematic review; Randomized controlled trial; Ventral Hernia; Robotic Surgery; Incisional Hernia; Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh; Ipom
41377485,Monocular Vision-Based Endoscopic Sinus Navigation: A SLAM Driven Approach With CT Integration.,"Surgical navigation is critical in sinus surgery to enhance the surgeon's spatial awareness and improve precision, particularly around occluded critical structures. While external tracker-based navigation systems exist, vision-based solutions are preferred for being less intrusive and for enabling endoscopic image analysis to assist surgeons. However, monocular endoscopy navigation faces challenges associated with monocular reconstruction and camera pose estimation. This paper presents a proof of concept for monocular vision-based sinus navigation that utilizes only preoperative CT data and the endoscope video stream to navigate the sinus anatomy. We developed a vision-based navigation system that incorporates a SLAM algorithm to estimate the camera pose and reconstruct the 3D surface of the anatomy. Given an initial semi-automated registration, the algorithm maps the SLAM-based trajectories to the CT space while employing the reconstructed point cloud to solve for the scale interactively. The system displays the updates in the CT triplane visualization as SLAM reconstructs the scene and recovers pose information. We tested our system by performing an off-site navigation in ten recorded endoscopic video streaming generated from sequences obtained from eight cadaveric subjects, comparing the vision-based navigation to reference optical tracker pose data and obtaining translation and rotation errors of 3.2 mm and 4.9 degrees, respectively. Additionally, we performed three on-site tests of our system on two different cadaver experiments. Our work evaluates a fully integrated system that closes the loop between image-based reconstruction and CT visualization, and discusses the challenges to address to achieve clinical level surgical navigation.",Soberanis-Mukul RD; Chan CHR; Chou R; Mangulabnan JE; Seenivasan L; Chen X; Salehizadeh M; Vedula SS; Taylor RH; Ishii M; Hager G; Unberath M,Department of Computer Science Johns Hopkins University Baltimore USA.,Healthcare technology letters,2025-12-09,10.1049/htl2.70046,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Computer vision; Endoscopy; Monocular Slam; Sinus Navigation; Image‐based Navigation; Point Tracking Foundation Model; 3D Motion Estimation

41388318,Getting to Implementation: applying data-driven implementation strategies to improve guideline concordant surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma.,"<h4>Background</h4>While guidelines recommend twice-yearly liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) surveillance for people with cirrhosis, adherence to these guidelines remains variable. We aimed to empirically identify and apply successful implementation strategies through Getting to Implementation (GTI), a manualized facilitation approach.<h4>Methods</h4>A hybrid type III, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial was conducted at 12 underperforming Veterans Health Administration (VA) sites between October 2020 and October 2022. GTI included a stepwise approach to guide sites to detail their current state, set implementation goals, identify implementation barriers, select implementation strategies, make a work plan, conduct an evaluation, and sustain their work. Outcomes were defined using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.<h4>Results</h4>Facilitators supported site teams with an average of 20±6 facilitation hours over a 12-month period. Ten of 12 sites (83%) adopted GTI and applied a median of five strategies (e.g., dashboard use, small tests of change, direct patient outreach). Reach, the primary outcome, increased from mean 29.1% to mean 38.8% at-risk Veterans receiving HCC surveillance from pre- to post-intervention, and further increasing to 41.3% in the sustainment period. In both unadjusted and adjusted models, the odds of HCC surveillance were significantly higher during intervention (adjusted odds ratio, aOR=1.67, 95% CI:1.59, 1.75) and during sustainment (aOR=1.69, 95% CI:1.60, 1.78) compared with baseline, and with difference between active and sustainment periods, indicating sustained improvement after active facilitation ended.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GTI sustainably improved HCC surveillance, suggesting that applying data-driven implementation strategies within a manualized facilitation approach can improve care.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04178096.",Yakovchenko V; Kang C; Neely B; Lamorte C; McCurdy H; Scott D; Nobbe A; Robins G; Ekanem NR; Merante M; Gibson S; Spoutz P; Chia L; Gonzalez RI; Chinman MJ; Ross D; Chartier M; Beste LA; Bajaj JS; Taddei T; Morgan TR; Rogal SS,"Center for Healthcare Evaluation, Research, and Promotion, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Building 30, Room 2A113 University Drive C (151C, Pittsburgh, PA, 15240, USA.",Implementation science : IS,2025-12-12,10.1186/s13012-025-01469-w,2.8,"dashboard(abstract); data(title,abstract)",Cancer; Cirrhosis; Hepatoma; Dissemination; intervention
41359445,"Dose-response associations between leisure-time physical activity, heart age and predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk.","<h4>Background</h4>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the dose-response relationship between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and cardiovascular health, assessed by heart age and predicted 10-year CVD risk, and explore the mediating role of inflammatory regulation.<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional study included 6658 individuals aged 30-74 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015-2018. Heatmap visualization assessed variable distributions, while generalized linear regression models (GLMs) and restricted cubic splines quantitatively examined the LTPA-cardiovascular health associations.<h4>Results</h4>Heatmap visualization revealed that, among the 26 variables evaluated, LTPA was inversely associated with heart age, predicted 10-year CVD risk, and odds ratio for high CVD risk. GLM analyses indicated that each additional hour per week of LTPA was associated with a 0.17-year reduction in heart age, a 0.07% decrease in predicted 10-year CVD risk, and a 5% lower odds for having high CVD risk. Vigorous-intensity LTPA showed stronger benefits than moderate activity. Systemic inflammation biomarkers significantly mediated the associations between LTPA and cardiovascular health.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings support a dose-dependent cardioprotective effect of LTPA, partially mediated through anti-inflammatory pathways. These results highlight the importance of promoting LTPA, particularly vigorous-intensity activity, for cardiovascular health promotion.",Ding Y; Xu X; Xu B; Wang R,"Department of Physical Education, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, 200 Xiaolingwei Street, Xuanwu District, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu Province, China.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2025-12-08,10.1093/pubmed/fdaf154,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Physical Activity; Systemic Inflammation; Cardiovascular Health; National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey; Heart Age

41361203,Sulfide silver autometallography to differentiate the ultrastructural localization of iron-carbohydrate complexes inside macrophages.,"Iron is an essential element for numerous physiological processes in the human body, and maintaining proper iron homeostasis is critical for health. Iron imbalance can lead to conditions like iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Intravenous (IV) iron drugs, including iron-carbohydrate complexes such as iron sucrose (IS) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), are commonly used in the treatment of IDA. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the uptake and intracellular fate of these complexes remain poorly understood despite over seven decades of clinical use. This study introduces a novel application of sulfide silver autometallography (ssAMG) to track iron inside macrophages treated with two widely used intravenous iron products, IS and FCM. Using this technique, the ultrastructural localization of iron in macrophages was visualized in comparison to ferric ion (Fe<sup>3+</sup>). ssAMG improved the visualization of IS and FCM, revealed as crystalline, cluster-like particles, i.e. silver precipitates, localized inside intracellular vesicles. Interestingly, for both iron-carbohydrate complexes, the silver precipitates were observed exclusively inside the cells and not on the cell surface as seen for ferric ion. These results suggest that IS and FCM are not internalized by macrophages as ferric iron bound to transferrin and provide new insights into the cellular processing of iron-carbohydrate complexes to advance the understanding of iron homeostasis.",Cao AM; Duruz J; de Almeida MS; Vanhecke D; Alston AE; Digigow R; Flühmann B; Petri-Fink A; Rothen-Rutishauser B,"Adolphe Merkle Institute, University of Fribourg, Chemin des Verdiers 4, Fribourg, Switzerland.",Scientific reports,2025-12-08,10.1038/s41598-025-27257-6,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Electron microscopy; biodistribution; Drug Delivery; Ferric Carboxymaltose; Iron Sucrose; Sulfide Silver Autometallography

41387087,Mapping Molecular Diversity in Prostate Cancer With a Combined Multiplex IHC and RNA-ISH Assay.,"<h4>Background</h4>Molecular heterogeneity in prostate cancer is defined by distinct gene fusions and expression profiles involving ERG, SPINK1, ETV1, and ETV4. These markers are typically mutually exclusive and represent biologically distinct molecular subtypes with clinical and therapeutic relevance. Conventional methods assess these markers independently, limiting the ability to study their spatial relationships within the same tumor focus.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a combined dual immunohistochemistry (IHC) and dual RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) assay for simultaneous detection of ERG, SPINK1, ETV1, and ETV4 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate cancer tissues. Validated antibodies were used for ERG and SPINK1 protein detection, while RNAscope probes were employed for ETV1 and ETV4 mRNA visualization. The assay was optimized for sequential staining compatibility, chromogen contrast, and morphological preservation, and subsequently applied to prostate cancer cores representing various molecular subtypes.<h4>Results</h4>The combined assay enabled clear, concurrent visualization of ERG and SPINK1 protein expression together with ETV1 and ETV4 transcripts in a single tissue section. Expression patterns were mutually exclusive across tumor foci, consistent with known molecular subtypes of prostate cancer. The method maintained histological integrity and signal specificity, providing high-resolution spatial information that could not be obtained by separate assays. This approach allowed detailed assessment of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity within the same histological context.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This dual IHC and dual RNA-ISH approach represents a novel and reliable platform for multiplex detection of key prostate cancer biomarkers on a single slide. The method offers significant advantages for molecular classification, tissue-based biomarker validation, and comprehensive evaluation of tumor heterogeneity in translational and diagnostic research.",Carskadon S; Williamson S; Jyothilingam S; Gupta N; Palanisamy N,"Department of Urology, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, MI, USA.",The Prostate,2025-12-12,10.1002/pros.70108,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Gene fusion; prostate cancer; Erg; Etv4; Spink1; Rna In Situ Hybridization; Etv1; Molecular Heterogeneity; Multiplex Immunohistochemistry
41383046,Combined Use of Engineered PfAGO and LbCas12a for Nucleic Acid Detection.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgent need for rapid, accurate, and accessible nucleic acid detection technologies. Here, we present NAEPLS (Nucleic Acid Detection Based on Engineered PfAgo and LbCas12a with Split crRNA), a novel diagnostic platform that synergistically integrates the engineered DNA-guided nuclease PfAgo (mPfAgo) from <i>Pyrococcus furiosus</i> with CRISPR-Cas12a for ultrasensitive and specific pathogen detection. By leveraging mPfAgo's RNA-cleaving capability and LbCas12a's compatibility with split crRNA, NAEPLS achieved detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Coupling this assay with RT-RPA enabled ultrasensitive detection, achieving a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 copies/mL. The system demonstrates single-nucleotide specificity, robustly discriminating mutations in mocked samples (such as D614G) as well as in clinical isolates (such as S371P). Notably, the compatibility with lateral flow strip visualization allows this method to be implemented as a rapid POCT platform, particularly valuable in resource-limited settings. Validation with 20 clinical samples (Ct 20-39) showed 100% concordance with RT-qPCR, including reliable detection of low viral loads (Ct > 35).

41389385,Mechanistic insights into the effects of micro- and nano-plastics on cherry radish physiology and organic compound distribution at the soil-root interface.,"Plastics are extensively applied in agricultural production, and exposure of crops to micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) can markedly affect crop health. However, current understanding of the effects of particle size and concentration on the physiological and biochemical responses of plants remains limited. In this study, the effects of polyethylene micro-plastics (2 μm) and nano-plastics (200 nm) at varying concentrations in cherry radish were investigated. Plant biomass, physiological and biochemical responses, and the microspatial distribution and transport behavior of organic components at the soil-root interface were evaluated. The results demonstrated that high concentrations (150 mg/kg) of both micro- and nano-sized plastic particles significantly inhibited plant growth and photosynthetic performance, including reductions in chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, and stomatal conductance. Notably, stress resistance indicators, such as soluble protein and soluble sugar, were affected, particularly at higher concentrations. SEM analysis directly verified the attachment of micro-plastic particles to root surfaces, whereas nano-particles were capable of penetrating root tissues. Synchrotron radiation-based FTIR imaging enabled in situ visualization of functional group distributions within the soil-root microenvironment, and semi-quantitative analysis further revealed a significant increase in carboxylic functional groups under nanoscale plastic exposure. This study also proposed a novel strategy to characterize the distribution and interactions of organic components within plant roots under MNP-induced stress.

41195831,"Activatable covalent labeling probes: design, mechanism, and biological applications.","Stimuli-activatable covalent labeling probes have emerged as powerful tools for targeted biomolecule labeling, addressing the limitations of conventional covalent probes, such as off-target reactivity, limited spatiotemporal control, and low signal-to-background ratios. These probes remain inert under physiological conditions but are selectively activated by specific endogenous or exogenous stimuli-such as enzymes, reactive oxygen species, light, ultrasound, or X-ray irradiation-initiating a cascade of stimulus-activation-covalent ligation. This mechanism enables precise, on-demand covalent conjugation to target biomolecules, improving labeling specificity, enhancing probe retention at pathological sites, and reducing interference with healthy tissues. Recent advances in molecular design, including enzymatic or light-mediated proximity labeling, have expanded their applications in protein profiling, interaction mapping, cell-cell communication analysis, and <i>in vivo</i> imaging. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design principles, activation strategies focusing on enzymatic and photochemical triggers, and key biomedical applications, while critically assessing challenges related to stability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical translation.

41384932,Evaluation of Mars Interventional Tool Box (MITBO) Technique for Ultrasound-Guided Abdominal Drainage: A Retrospective Study of Safety and Feasibility in 111 Patients.,"IntroductionThe Mars Interventional Tool Box (MITBO) technique, a simplified drainage procedure using point-of-care ultrasound, provides a versatile solution for use in resource-limited environments, such as space missions and remote terrestrial regions. This study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the MITBO technique in a clinical setting.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 111 patients who underwent ultrasound-guided abdominal drainage using the MITBO technique between August 2022 and February 2023. The study included patients with abdominal collections (eg, intra-abdominal abscesses, gallbladder infections) as well as retroperitoneal procedures such as nephrostomies. Fluoroscopic or CT-guided cases were excluded. Feasibility was determined by the successful placement of drains under ultrasound guidance alone. Safety was assessed by documenting complications.ResultsThe overall technical success rate was 97%, with 3 cases of failure: 1 due to patient non-cooperation and 2 because of non-visualization of the collections. The complication rate was 4.5% (<i>n</i> = 5), all of which were minor. No major complications, such as hemorrhage or infection, were observed. Nephrostomies, accounting for 4% of the procedures, were performed exclusively by senior radiologists with 100% success.ConclusionThe MITBO technique demonstrated high success rates and a low complication profile, consistent with previous reports on standard drainage techniques. The standardized procedure is a promising alternative in environments where advanced imaging is unavailable. However, the limited sample size, especially for complex cases, and the exclusive performance of nephrostomies by experienced operators suggest the need for further studies to generalize these findings.",Nikolov T; Andriamihamina N; Soussan J; Beregi JP; Vidal V; Frandon J,"Department of Medical Imaging, IPI Plateform, Nîmes University Hospital, Medical Imaging Group Nîmes, IMAGINE, University of Montpellier, Nîmes, France.",Wilderness & environmental medicine,2025-12-12,10.1177/10806032251403933,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Infectious diseases; Emergency Medicine; Wilderness Medicine Education; Aeromedical; Backcountry Medicine; Wilderness Emergency Medical Service
41379303,Isthmocele: from Detection to Treatment: A Narrative Review.,"Isthmocele, also known as cesarean scar defect, is an increasingly recognized complication of cesarean delivery, often associated with abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, and secondary infertility. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the condition, including its pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic methods, and current treatment options. The most significant risk factor for isthmocele formation is the number of previous cesarean sections, although other contributing elements include surgical technique, uterine position, and individual wound-healing capacity. Transvaginal ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality, while magnetic resonance imaging may provide enhanced visualization in selected cases. Management depends on the severity of symptoms, residual myometrial thickness, and reproductive goals. Treatment options range from conservative medical therapy to surgical interventions via hysteroscopic, vaginal, or laparoscopic approaches. Surgical correction is particularly indicated in symptomatic women with reproductive desire and thin residual myometrium. The choice of technique should be individualized on the basis of the characteristics of the defect, the presence of coexisting pathologies, and surgical expertise. Preventive strategies focus on optimal cesarean technique, with emerging evidence supporting the importance of suture method and postoperative ultrasound monitoring. Despite increasing awareness, standardized guidelines for diagnosis and treatment are lacking. A tailored approach remains essential, considering both clinical and anatomical variables. This review summarizes the current knowledge on isthmocele and highlights the need for further research to establish evidence-based protocols for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",Habib N; Upane A; Ivanova L; Schettini G; Pieri E; Giorgi M; Rovira R; Centini G,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinique de L'Yvette, 67 Route de Corbeil, Longjumeau, France. n.habib@ght-yvelinesnord.fr.",Advances in therapy,2025-12-11,10.1007/s12325-025-03412-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Infertility; SCAR; Hysteroscopy; Cesarean; laparoscopy; Transvaginal; Isthmocele
41372763,High-frequency intraoral ultrasonography for periodontal tissue characterization: a pilot study exploring echogenic signatures and inflammation detection.,"<h4>Background</h4>To assess the feasibility and diagnostic potential of high-frequency intraoral ultrasonography for the real-time evaluation and characterization of periodontal tissues, including tissue echogenicity under both healthy and inflammatory conditions. Building on our prior preclinical validation of ultrasound for pocket depth measurement in a porcine model, this pilot study provides the first human application, focusing on a novel echogenicity-based 'atlas' for differentiating healthy and inflammatory periodontal tissues.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective single-center pilot study included 13 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. Each participant underwent a standardized examination combining high frequency ultrasonographic imaging (20 MHz). A total of 1,987 ultrasonic ultrasonography measurements were recorded. Ultrasonographic images were analyzed using ImageJ to assess the mean and standard deviation of pixel intensity across several periodontal tissue types. Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis testing, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and K-means clustering to explore echogenicity-based tissue differentiation.<h4>Results</h4>Ultrasound imaging enabled visualization of periodontal structures (enamel, cementum, alveolar bone, connective tissue, inflammatory tissue). Mean echogenicity values differed significantly across tissue types (p < 0.001), with enamel showing the highest mean pixel intensity (200 ± 15) and inflammatory tissue the lowest (50 ± 10). LDA achieved partial tissue separation, while K-means clustering identified six distinct echogenicity-based clusters. Real-time imaging detected subgingival calculus and deep tissue inflammation in 8 of 13 patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>High-frequency intraoral ultrasonography is a feasible, non-invasive method for real-time periodontal tissue characterization. Echogenicity provides a robust marker for tissue differentiation and inflammation detection, but further studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate its clinical utility and automate diagnostic processes.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (Approval No. 22.04642.000161) and registered on the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) under the identifier NCT05809427 (07/07/2023).",Estrade L; Delpierre A; Rimbaud V; Denis F; Rochefort GY; Renaud M,"Department of Medicine and Bucco-dental surgery, Tours University Hospital, Tours, France.",BMC oral health,2025-12-11,10.1186/s12903-025-07485-y,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Periodontal Pocket; Periodontal Tissues; Echogenicity; Non-invasive Diagnostics; High-frequency Ultrasonography; Inflammation Detection
41381071,All-arthroscopic repair of talar-sided anterior talofibular ligament insertion tears using knotless anchors: A retrospective case series.,"ObjectiveTo describe the surgical technique and evaluate the clinical efficacy of all-arthroscopic knotless anchor repair for talar-sided anterior talofibular ligament tears in the treatment of chronic lateral ankle instability.MethodsThis retrospective case series included 11 patients treated between February 2020 and October 2022. All patients presented with persistent lateral ankle pain and instability following an ankle sprain that did not respond to at least 6 months of conventional conservative management. Preoperative assessment included physical examination (positive anterior drawer and varus stress tests) and magnetic resonance imaging, which verified talar-sided anterior talofibular ligament insertion tears. The procedure was performed under complete arthroscopic visualization. Initially, the ankle joint was debrided to remove hyperplastic synovium and loose bodies. Then, the anterior talofibular ligament was tensioned using a suture tape passed through a two-wire loop sleeve. Finally, the ligament was secured with an absorbable knotless anchor implanted at the anatomical talar insertion site of the anterior talofibular ligament.ResultsAll 11 patients were followed up for a mean duration of 13.27 ± 2.41 months. At the final follow-up, significant clinical improvements were observed compared with the preoperative status: the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot score increased from 42.62 ± 2.2 to 95.73 ± 1.43 (p < 0.001), and the pain score on a visual analog scale decreased from 6.47 ± 1.25 to 1.73 ± 1.26 (p < 0.001). No postoperative complications occurred, including wound infection, cutaneous nerve injury, or recurrent ankle instability. All patients reported improved ankle stability and returned to daily activities without significant limitation.ConclusionFor patients with chronic lateral ankle instability caused by talar-sided anterior talofibular ligament insertion tears, all-arthroscopic knotless anchor repair results in minimal surgical trauma, enables safe and reliable anatomical restoration of the ligament, and yields satisfactory short-term functional outcomes and pain relief. However, given the limitations of the retrospective case series design, including a small sample size and lack of a control group, further prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate its long-term efficacy.",Liu F; Pan H; Huang RK,"Department of Orthopedics, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, China.",The Journal of international medical research,2025-12-11,10.1177/03000605251404782,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Arthroscopy; Ankle Instability; Ligament Repair; Anterior Talofibular Ligament; Knotless Suture Anchor
41359627,Optical tissue clearing and 3D imaging of intact primate testicular tissue: a novel technology development.,"Classical histology struggles to preserve three-dimensional spatial context, prompting the emergence of optical tissue clearing techniques that enable imaging of intact specimens at cellular or subcellular resolution. These techniques have revolutionised fields like cell biology, developmental biology, and neuroscience. However, their application in reproductive biology remains unexplored - particularly in studying the complexities of testicular development. We developed a novel, efficient and affordable toolbox for studying intact testicular tissues, PT-CLEAR3D, that stands for primate testis - whole mount staining, tissue clearing and three-dimensional imaging. Intact testicular tissues from humans (transgender model), common marmosets and macaques underwent antibody labelling, clearing with organic solvents, and three-dimensional imaging using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. Marker specificity was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of 3 and 25 µm testicular sections, followed by imaging with confocal microscopy. The testicular structure was evaluated using several markers: spermatogonia (melanoma-associated antigen 4), least differentiated spermatogonia (Piwi-like protein 4), Sertoli cells (vimentin and SRY-Box transcription Factor 9), peritubular myoid cells and vasculature (alpha-smooth muscle actin), and NucSpot as a nuclear dye. PT-CLEAR3D efficiently achieved optical transparency while a commercial kit that was run in parallel was inefficient. This study presents a pioneering three-dimensional visualization of intact testicular samples of up to 50 mm3 in size and imaging depth of up to 4.5 mm across three primate species. Remarkably, PT-CLEAR3D revealed critical details at both tissue and cellular levels such as the spatial distribution of germ and somatic cells, cellular bridges, and vasculature. Furthermore, PT-CLEAR3D enabled three-dimensional reconstructions that effectively reduces confirmation bias enhancing our observation of spermatogonial clones organized as single cells, pairs, and quartets. Importantly, it adeptly identified testicular pathology and the persistence of germ cell clones in select tubules within the transgender testis following hormonal suppression of spermatogenesis. This technological development offers a versatile toolbox with benefits such as applicability across multiple species, fluorophore multiplexing, compatibility with different fixatives and deep tissue volumetric imaging with cellular resolution. Overall, PT-CLEAR3D establishes a foundation for spatial evaluation of testicular development, presenting substantial potential for advancing our understanding of the intricate kinetics of spermatogenesis in health and disease.",Kibui PW; Weischer S; von Ostau N; Hess J; Kirschnick N; Zobel T; Schlatt S,"Centre of Reproductive Medicine and Andrology, University of Münster, Münster, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.",PloS one,2025-12-08,10.1371/journal.pone.0327287,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41380995,Genomic analysis of a novel high-risk ST5217/ExoU+/O11 clone of carbapenem-resistant OXA-181- and VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in India.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Studies of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA)-harbouring OXA-48-like carbapenemases are rare. The study aimed to report the emergence and characterization of a novel high-risk clone of CRPA-harbouring OXA-48-like from India.<h4>Methods</h4>Identification, AST, phenotypic detection of carbapenemases and WGS using Ion-Torrent-S5 platform were carried out. Analyses included ResFinder, VFDB, MLST, PAst, Phastest and CRISPR/Cas. SNP-based phylogenetic analysis with global OXA-48-like-harbouring CRPA genomes was carried out by CSI Phylogeny and iTOL for visualization.<h4>Results</h4>The clinical strain of CRPA AMRIR00655 belonged to a novel sequence type ST5217 and serotype O11. The strain was MDR. Phenotypic tests followed by WGS revealed the presence of dual carbapenemases, OXA-181 (serine-carbapenemase) and VIM-2 (zinc-carbapenemase), both located on chromosome. 4,261 bp of bla<sub>OXA-181</sub>-bearing contig-DNA showed 100% homology to K. pneumoniae plasmid pKP3-A. ISEcp1 was present on upstream and on downstream<sub>,</sub> △lysR, △ereA and repA genes were detected. bla<sub>VIM-2</sub> was located within class 1 integron along with aacC6-II, dfrB5, aac(3)-Id, tniC in surrounding regions<sub>.</sub> Presence of other ARGs (bla<sub>PAO</sub>, bla<sub>OXA-488,</sub>aph(3'')-Ib, aph(6)-Id, crpP, catB7, fosA, sul2) and efflux-pump genes might explain its MDR phenotype. Virulence factors including T3SS (PscF, PopB, PopD, PcrV) and its effectors (ExoT, ExoU, ExoY) indicated the pathogenic potential of ST5217. Core genome analysis showed that ST5217 was closest with other high-risk clones ST1339 and ST773-harbouring bla<sub>OXA-48-like</sub>.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of bla<sub>OXA-181</sub>-harbouring novel high-risk clone of CRPA ST5217/ExoU+/O11 in India which emphasises the spread of OXA-181 among bacteria other than Enterobacteriaceae-family and warrant close monitoring.",Roy S; Nandy S; Morita D; Nandy RK; Veeraraghavan B; Walia K; Das S; Basu S,"Division of Bacteriology, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Bacterial Infections (ICMR-NIRBI), Kolkata, India.

41371944,"Anemia Mukt Bharat Index: Methodology and State Rankings of Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation Coverage in India, 2018-2019 to 2022-2023.","In 2018, the Government of India launched the Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) program to accelerate reductions in the prevalence of anemia among children aged 6-59 months, children aged 5-9 years, adolescents aged 10-19 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers through 6 programmatic interventions and 6 institutional mechanisms. We describe the process of computing the AMB index, aimed at providing timely and systematic information on iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation coverage across these groups to aid in evaluating the effectiveness of the program. This study presents data from fiscal year 2018-2019 to 2022-2023 on IFA supplementation coverage among these 5 groups. We calculated the AMB index that provides an average for IFA supplementation coverage for target groups. Data on the target groups were acquired from the AMB dashboard, and information on IFA supplementation coverage was sourced from the health management information system. The AMB index confirmed that between 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 IFA supplementation coverage increased overall in India by 22.1 percentage points, from 35.5% to 57.6%. During this period, IFA supplementation coverage increased for all target groups including pregnant women, children aged 6-59 months, children 5-9 years, adolescents aged 10-19 years, and lactating mothers. The supply chain management and reporting of the data on the portal were among the key factors that substantially impacted the IFA supplementation coverage. The IFA supplementation coverage will significantly increase if the IFA supply chain and reporting standards improve. We discuss the policy implications and suggestions to improve the overall IFA supplementation coverage across India.",Rizvi ZA; Singh J; Mishra P; Kumar A; Saini A; Patel N; Agarwal N; Yadav K; Joe W,"Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Delhi, India.","Global health, science and practice",2025-12-10,10.9745/ghsp-d-24-00077,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
