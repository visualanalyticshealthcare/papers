40531282,Infection Spread and Outbreaks Support with Spatial-Temporal Visualization Tool for Hospitals.,"Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), especially those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, represent a critical challenge, increasing healthcare costs, hospital stays, and mortality rates. Monitoring HAIs requires integrating spatial-temporal data from patient records and microbiology results. However, current manual methods are time-consuming and error-prone. Although temporal factors are often considered, spatial patient distribution and hospital topological factors are frequently overlooked. Interactive information visualization provides a solution, combining diverse data sources to enhance understanding of spatial-temporal relationships. We aim to develop OBViz, an interactive visual tool employing spatial-temporal visualization techniques to analyze infection spread and hospital epidemic situations over time. Four user tasks relevant in HAIs control were defined, focusing on spatial-temporal pathogen localization and identifying outbreak origins. Using Unity 3D and C#, along with a simulated dataset of hospitalized patients experiencing an infection spread, we developed a visual interactive tool that integrates 3D hospital visualization for patients' individual monitoring, 2D visualization for tracking epidemiological indicators, and tabular view for detailed information. A user study with 14 healthcare personnel evaluated its usability, usefulness and interpretability. Interactivity and animations accurately depicted movements and infection processes, while known charts facilitated temporal understanding. Despite room for improvement in patient tracking (57.14% success rate), OBViz demonstrated strong potential for decision-making (91.43% success rate), healthcare education, and integration into clinical workflows (Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire result: 1.85). The tool's interactive spatial visualization and clear time control were preferred over more abstract methods, highlighting its utility in hospital epidemic analysis.",Kim D; Canovas-Segura B; Campos M; Aleman Belando S; Juarez JM,"Med AI Lab, University of Murcia, Campus Espinardo, 30100, Murcia, Spain. denissemisoo.kim@um.es.",Journal of medical systems,2025-06-18,10.1007/s10916-025-02219-7,12.0,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Infection control; Hospital-acquired Infection; Multi-resistant Bacteria; Visualization Application; Spatial-temporal Visualization

40532602,Biological effects of graphene oxide-induced fluorescent marker perturbation in Caenorhabditis elegans via food chain exposure.,"Graphene oxide (GO), an oxidized derivative of graphene with broad industrial and biomedical applications, has raised increasing concerns about its potential biological risks, although its impacts on human health remain poorly understood. To investigate the biological impacts of GO visualization under conditions simulating food chain exposure, we used Caenorhabditis elegans as the test organism and Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) as the exposure environment to evaluate GO as an environmental pollutant. Our findings demonstrate that this approach effectively facilitates the behavioral endpoints of organisms' emergency responses to environmental stressors, including their effects on the reproductive system, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and other related impacts. Significant apoptosis was observed within the mitotic and meiotic regions of C. elegans gonad under GO stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipofuscin accumulation increased significantly, indicating heightened oxidative stress and cellular damage. In addition, the accumulation of the HSU-1 protein, which may disrupt cellular functions and lead to irreversible DNA damage, was found in gonad cells, further accelerating cell apoptosis in C. elegans. Furthermore, under environmental stress induced by GO, DAF-16::GFP translocates to the nucleus, and SKN-1 protein is overexpressed in the somatic cells of nematodes, triggering an emergency response that effectively mitigates the toxic effects of GO. The toxic effects associated with food chain exposure were significantly greater than those associated with direct exposure. Our study also demonstrated that the toxicological effects associated with GO visualization intensified with increasing GO concentration, with both exposure routes exhibiting dose-dependent characteristics. Moreover, the amplified toxicity of food chain exposure highlights the heightened risks associated with indirect exposure pathways. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of C. elegans as a model organism for visually assessing the biological effects of nanomaterials and environmental pollutants, providing a rapid and efficient method for detecting environmental contaminants.",Luo X; Tu J; Xu H; Xia E; Yao S; Han Y; Niu C; Chen L,"Key Laboratory of Bioresource and Environmental Biotechnology of Anhui Higher Education Institutes, School of Biological Engineering & Institute of Digital Ecology and Health, Huainan Normal University, Huainan 232001, PR China.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2025-06-17,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.118524,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Food chain; Visualization; gO; C.

40531831,Machine learning driven dashboard for chronic myeloid leukemia prediction using protein sequences.,"The prevalence of Leukaemia, a malignant blood cancer that originates from hematopoietic progenitor cells, is increasing in Southeast Asia, with a worrisome fatality rate of 54%. Predicting outcomes in the early stages is vital for improving the chances of patient recovery. The aim of this research is to enhance early-stage prediction systems in a substantial manner. Using Machine Learning and Data Science, we exploit protein sequential data from commonly altered genes including BCL2, HSP90, PARP, and RB to make predictions for Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML). The methodology we implement is based on the utilisation of reliable methods for extracting features, namely Di-peptide Composition (DPC), Amino Acid Composition (AAC), and Pseudo amino acid composition (Pse-AAC). We also take into consideration the identification and handling of outliers, as well as the validation of feature selection using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCA). Data augmentation guarantees a comprehensive dataset for analysis. By utilising several Machine Learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Logistic Regression (LR), we have achieved accuracy rates ranging from 66% to 94%.

40537129,Where do People Engage in Physical Activity? A Visualization Approach to the Domain Composition of Population Physical Activity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Effective physical activity promotion requires a comprehensive understanding of physical activity across work, household, travel, and recreation domains. Although previous studies have assessed the relative contributions of each domain to total physical activity using averages, the distribution among diverse individuals remains unclear. We aimed to develop a visualization approach to assess the distribution of the relative contributions of each domain to physical activity.<h4>Methods</h4>We used nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2018 for the United States and 2020 Sasakawa Sports Foundation National Sports-Life Survey for Japan; both utilized the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. We calculated each domain's relative contribution to total physical activity and created histograms of ternary plots.<h4>Results</h4>The distribution of each domain's relative contributions to total physical activity demonstrated that most participants from the United States and Japan concentrated their activity in 1 or 2 domains. However, clusters of domain composition differed between the 2 countries. In the United States, work/household contributions were highest (50.6%), with fewer individuals having high travel contributions. In Japan, travel contributed the most (41.7%), with many clusters showing low work/household contributions. The average total moderate and vigorous physical activity in both countries was higher among those with greater work/household contributions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our novel visualization approach demonstrated that most participants concentrate their physical activity in 1 or 2 domains. Given the diverse ways to meet physical activity guidelines, it is crucial to adopt a systems approach that considers each domain, from enhancing active transportation to promoting recreational physical activity.",Fujioka N; Hayashi Y; Lee IM; Kamada M,"Department of Political Science, Faculty of Law, Hosei University, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan.",Journal of physical activity & health,2025-06-17,10.1123/jpah.2025-0053,7.0,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract)",Distribution; Surveillance; Descriptive Epidemiology; Relative Contribution; Domain-specific Physical Activity
40536610,"Super-resolution for localizing electrode grids as small, deformable objects during epilepsy surgery using augmented reality headsets.","<h4>Purpose</h4>Epilepsy surgery is a potential curative treatment for people with focal epilepsy. Intraoperative electrocorticogram (ioECoG) recordings from the brain guide neurosurgeons during resection. Accurate localization of epileptic activity and thus the ioECoG grids is critical for successful outcomes. We aim to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a novel method for localizing small, deformable objects using augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) and artificial intelligence (AI). AR HMDs combine cameras and patient overlay visualization in a compact design.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed an image processing method for the HoloLens 2 to localize a 64-electrode ioECoG grid even when individual electrodes are indistinguishable due to low resolution. The method combines object detection, super-resolution, and pose estimation AI models with stereo triangulation. A synthetic dataset of 90,000 images trained the super-resolution and pose estimation models. The system was tested in a controlled environment against an optical tracker as ground truth. Accuracy was evaluated at distances between 40 and 90 cm.<h4>Results</h4>The system achieved sub-5 mm accuracy in localizing the ioECoG grid at distances shorter than 60 cm. At 40 cm, the accuracy remained below 2 mm, with an average standard deviation of less than 0.5 mm. At 60 cm the method processed on average 24 stereo frames per second.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study demonstrates the feasibility of localizing small, deformable objects like ioECoG grids using AR HMDs. While results indicate clinically acceptable accuracy, further research is needed to validate the method in clinical environments and assess its impact on surgical precision and outcomes.",Salim HS; Thabit A; Hoogteijling S; van 't Klooster MA; van Walsum T; Zijlmans M; Benmahdjoub M,"High Performance Compute & Visualization, SURF bv, Utrecht, The Netherlands. hizirwan.salim@surf.nl.",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2025-06-19,10.1007/s11548-025-03401-5,6.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Epilepsy Surgery; Pose Estimation; computer-assisted surgery; Augmented Reality; Instrument Tracking; Intra-operative Electrocorticography
40535950,Clinical Experience With an Aragonite-Based Scaffold Implant for Knee Cartilage Repair: A Multicenter Case Series.,"Background There is a growing interest in the use of biomaterials to treat chondral and osteochondral knee lesions, given their ability to replicate the biological and functional properties needed for simultaneous cartilage and bone regeneration. A novel aragonite-based, cell-free biomimetic scaffold (CARTIHEAL AGILI-C<sup>TM</sup>, Smith + Nephew, UK) was developed for treating chondral and osteochondral defects in traumatic and osteoarthritic joints. A short-term follow-up study was designed to assess the safety and feasibility of this scaffold.  Materials and methods This retrospective review included data from nine centers in the United States (US) between August 22, 2023 and December 30, 2024. Adult patients (≥18 years of age) who received the aragonite-based scaffold as standard of care for the treatment of knee chondral/osteochondral lesions in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions for use were eligible. There were no prespecified exclusion criteria. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for radiologic assessment of knee cartilage lesions, which informed the development of presurgical plans. A diagnostic arthroscopy was performed before arthrotomy to confirm the radiographic findings obtained for preoperative planning. The primary endpoint was the incidence of early clinical and radiographic complications occurring within at least 30 days after the operation. Secondary endpoints included an assessment of the accuracy of presurgical planning relative to intraoperative findings, proportion of implants determined to be improperly implanted based on the first postoperative X-rays, change in the numeric pain rating score from baseline, and the proportion of patients cleared for various postoperative activities. Results A total of 33 patients (34 knees; mean age, 47.2 years; 18 (52.9%) male) were included. After a mean postoperative follow-up of 45.7 days (standard deviation, 14.4), one patient (2.9%) experienced a postoperative complication (pain, with no associated infection). Success rate was 96.97% (95% CI, 84.24-99.92). In 27 (79.4%) cases, the presurgical plan based on MRI was modified following arthroscopic visualization of the knee joint surface. Postoperative radiography revealed no complications for the 28 patients with data. Mean postoperative numeric pain rating significantly improved from 6.6 at baseline to 3.9 at follow-up (p<0.05). The majority of patients (n=24; 70.6%) were cleared for partial or full weightbearing by the 30-day postoperative follow-up visit.  Conclusions This case series across multiple centers in the US demonstrates the clinical safety and feasibility of aragonite scaffold implantation.

40531238,Super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF): a versatile and accessible tool for live-cell nanoscopy.,"Super-resolution radial fluctuation (SRRF) microscopy is a novel computational imaging technique that bypasses the optical diffraction limit (lateral resolutions of 200-300 nm), achieving lateral resolutions of approximately 50-100 nm while being compatible with live-cell imaging. Unlike traditional super-resolution methods such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) and single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), SRRF minimizes phototoxicity and hardware complexity by analyzing fluorescence intensity fluctuations in standard wide-field microscopy data. This is achieved by calculating local gradient convergence (""radiality"") across time-series images, enabling the reconstruction of sub-diffraction structures without specialized fluorophores or high-intensity illumination. Implemented through the open-source NanoJ-SRRF platform, SRRF optimizes parameters like ring radius and radiality magnification to enhance resolution, suppress noise, and maintain computational efficiency. Its advantages include low phototoxicity, compatibility with conventional dyes, and integration with various imaging modalities, allowing dynamic visualization of subcellular processes (e.g., mitochondrial fission, microtubule dynamics). Despite its limitations in axial resolution and potential artifacts in high-density structures, recent advancements like enhanced SRRF (eSRRF) and variance reweighted radial fluctuations and enhanced SRRF (VeSRRF) address these challenges, facilitating real-time, multicolor imaging. Applications range from ultrastructural studies to clinical pathology, with future developments in AI processing and multimodal integration promising further enhancements in imaging capabilities.

40528627,Development of a multiparametric nomogram model for coronary lesion-specific ischemia prediction based on coronary CTA technology.,"BackgroundCoronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of ischemic heart disease, and accurate identification of coronary lesion-specific ischemia (CLSI) is crucial for treatment. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) provides detailed visualization of coronary lesions, but its multiparameter analysis for predicting ischemia remains underexplored.ObjectiveTo develop a nomogram prediction model for CLSI based on multiparameters derived from CCTA.MethodsA total of 160 patients with CAD were divided into non-ischemic and ischemic groups according to the target-vessel CT-fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR). The baseline data of the two groups were collected, and the quantitative parameters of CCTA were compared. The predictive value of these parameters for CLSI was analyzed by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, and independent risk factors were analyzed by logistic regression.ResultsThe ischemic group showed significant differences in maximum diameter stenosis (MDS), maximum area stenosis (MAS), minimum lumen area (MLA), plaque burden (PB), pericoronary fat attenuation index (FAI), and low-attenuation plaque compared to the non-ischemic group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression revealed that MAS, MLA, FAI, and PB were independent risk factors for CLSI. The area under the curve (AUC) for MAS, MLA, FAI, and PB were 0.783, 0.947, 0.804, and 0.935, respectively. The calibration curve of the nomogram showed a good fit to the actual values [0.995 (95%CI: 0.988-1.000)].ConclusionsThis study constructed a nomogram risk prediction model for CLSI based on MAS, MLA, FAI, and PB, which holds significant clinical value.",Gao T; Zhang L; Zhou W; Song H; Yang B,"Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116000, China.",Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,2025-06-18,10.1177/09287329251351267,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Nomogram; Coronary Cta; Clinical Value; Ct-ffr; Coronary Lesion-specific Ischemia
40543272,Generative deep-learning-model based contrast enhancement for digital subtraction angiography using a text-conditioned image-to-image model.,"<h4>Background</h4>Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an essential imaging technique in interventional radiology, enabling detailed visualization of blood vessels by subtracting pre- and post-contrast images. However, reduced contrast, either accidental or intentional, can impair the clarity of vascular structures. This issue becomes particularly critical in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where minimizing iodinated contrast is necessary to reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). This study explored the potential of using a generative deep-learning-model based contrast enhancement technique for DSA.<h4>Method</h4>A text-conditioned image-to-image model was developed using Stable Diffusion, augmented with ControlNet to reduce hallucinations and Low-Rank Adaptation for model fine-tuning. A total of 1207 DSA series were used for training and testing, with additional low-contrast images generated through data augmentation. The model was trained using tagged text labels and evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Square (RMS) contrast, Michelson contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and entropy.<h4>Results</h4>Evaluation results indicated significant improvements, with RMS contrast, Michelson contrast, and entropy respectively increased from 7.91 to 17.7, 0.875 to 0.992, and 3.60 to 5.60, reflecting enhanced detail. However, SNR decreased from 21.3 to 8.50, indicating increased noise.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning-based contrast enhancement for DSA images and highlights the potential for generative deep-learning-model to improve angiographic imaging.

40540315,User Experiences With Digital Future-Self Interventions in the Contexts of Smoking and Physical Inactivity: Mixed Methods Multistudy Exploration.,"<h4>Background</h4>Smoking and physical inactivity compromise health, especially in combination. Interventions to promote smoking cessation and increased physical activity (PA) often lack impact, especially in the long term. Digital future-self interventions (FSIs), which prompt individuals to imagine who they do and do not want to become (ie, their desired and undesired future selves), show promise in encouraging sustainable changes in both behaviors. However, knowledge of user experiences with digital FSIs is limited. A deeper understanding of these experiences could help optimize FSIs, enhancing their efficacy in supporting smoking cessation and increased PA sustainably.<h4>Objective</h4>This study examined behavioral, cognitive, and affective experiences with digital FSIs focused on smoking, PA, or both. Potential differences in user experiences based on behavior (smoking vs PA), polarity (desired vs undesired future self), and modality (verbal vs visual description of future selves) were explored.<h4>Methods</h4>Secondary analyses of quantitative and qualitative survey data from 3 studies using digital FSIs as a means to encourage smoking cessation or increase PA were conducted. In study 1, participants (N=144) thought about how it would be to complete the FSI. In studies 2 (N=447) and 3 (N=87), they completed an FSI. Each study highlighted different aspects of user experiences with FSIs, namely, behavioral (eg, time spent), cognitive (eg, mental effort exerted), or affective (eg, emotions) experiences. Quantitative and qualitative findings were integrated for a comprehensive interpretation.<h4>Results</h4>Regarding behavioral experiences, participants completed future-self tasks promptly (mean 6.64, SD 8.30 minutes), spent less time completing the desired- versus undesired-future-self (P<.001; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.227) and verbal versus visual (P=.03; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.060; quantitative) tasks, and integrated the tasks into their lives (qualitative). Despite tasks being preparatory and not actively encouraging behavior change, multiple participants reported implementing changes in their smoking or PA (qualitative). Regarding cognitive experiences, moderate effort (mean 5.85/10, SD 2.56) was exerted on the tasks regardless of behavior (P=.69; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.002), modality (P=.45; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.004), or polarity (P=.69; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.002; quantitative). Experiences of task difficulty were inconsistent across studies, individuals, and tasks, although mental visualization and describing one's future self using images were consistently reported as challenging (quantitative and qualitative). Future-self tasks were reported to prompt cognitive processes such as contemplating consequences of smoking and PA behavior (qualitative). Regarding affective experiences, desired- and undesired-future-self tasks elicited different emotions (P<.001; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.630; quantitative). Desired-future-self tasks were perceived as enjoyable and happiness inducing, whereas undesired-future-self tasks were perceived as confronting and unpleasant, evoking feelings of sadness, fear, and anger (quantitative and qualitative).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Digital FSIs appeared to be a time-efficient, feasible, and acceptable way of strengthening identities as a means to encourage smoking cessation and PA. Findings support continued implementation of digital FSIs, although further research is required to optimize their operationalization.

40526557,3D Distance-color-coded Assessment of PCI Stent Apposition via Deep-learning-based Three-dimensional Multi-object Segmentation.,"Coronary artery disease poses a significant global health challenge, often necessitating percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. Assessing stent apposition is crucial for preventing and identifying PCI complications leading to in-stent restenosis. Here we propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) distance-color-coded assessment (DccA) for PCI stent apposition via deep-learning-based 3D multi-object segmentation in intravascular optical coherence tomography (IV-OCT). Our proposed 3D DccA accurately segments 3D vessel lumens and stents in IV-OCT images, using a hybrid-dimensional spatial matching network and dual-layer training with style transfer. It quantifies and maps stent-lumen distances into a 3D color space, achieving a 3D visual assessment of PCI stent apposition. Achieving over 95% segmentation precision for both stent struts and the lumen and having 3D color visualization, our proposed 3D DccA improves the clinical evaluation of PCI stent deployment and facilitates personalized treatment planning.",Qin X; Huang H; Lin S; Zeng X; Cao K; Wu R; Huang Y; Yang J; Liu Y; Li G; Ni G,,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2025-06-17,10.1109/tmi.2025.3580619,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40536177,Technical Tip: The Use of Arthroscopic Portals to Safeguard Medial Neurovascular Structures During Suture Button Fixation.,"IntroductionAnkle fractures with concurrent syndesmotic instability are commonly encountered orthopaedic injuries. Suture button syndesmotic fixation has emerged as a favorable alternative to traditional screw fixation due to its comparable biomechanical stability and reduced hardware removal rates. However, concerns persist regarding potential injury to medial neurovascular structures during tibial cortical button deployment and a medial incision is often recommended for verification.TechniqueThis paper describes a safe and reproducible technique for suture button fixation that offers an alternative to a medial incision. Using an anteromedial arthroscopy portal, indirect visualization, and palpation ensure safe tibial button placement, avoiding neurovascular structure impingement or soft tissue entrapment.DiscussionVia cadavers, we confirmed the absence of neurovascular or soft tissue injury. Anecdotally, this approach has been successfully implemented in multiple clinical cases without observed intraoperative complications or immediate post-operative neurovascular injuries. However, further studies with more rigorous follow-up are needed to confirm its safety and efficacy in a clinical setting. By utilizing an anteromedial arthroscopic portal, this technique offers a potential alternative for confirming button placement without requiring an additional medial incision. Avoiding a medial incision may reduce risks associated with wound healing, infection, and morbidity in the medial ankle-an area prone to soft tissue breakdown. Further research is necessary to assess long-term clinical outcomes and validate the broader applicability of this approach.ConclusionThe described arthroscopic-assisted technique provides a safe, efficient method for suture button fixation in syndesmotic injuries without requiring a medial incision. By utilizing indirect visualization and palpation, it minimizes risks of neurovascular injury and surgical morbidity while preserving the benefits of suture button constructs.

40521910,Bedside Sonographic Ventricular Monitoring Through a Sonolucent Cranial Implant for Weaning of External Ventricular Drain After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>The development of sonolucent cranial implants has led to the possibility of sonographic visualization of intracranial structures. The use of ultrasound instead of computed tomography imaging for ventricular monitoring during external ventricular drain (EVD) weaning has not yet been described. This study aims to describe the feasibility of bedside sonographic ventricular monitoring for EVD weaning after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and to report our preliminary clinical experience.<h4>Methods</h4>A 24-mm sonolucent cranial implant was incorporated in the bone flap after clipping of a ruptured aneurysm. Baseline sonographic measurements of ventricular size were obtained with the EVD set at 10 cm. After raising the EVD to 15 cm for 24 hours, a second sonographic assessment was performed. If ventricular size, intracranial pressure and the examination remained stable, the EVD was clamped. A third sonographic assessment was conducted 24 hours after clamping. If ventricular size, intracranial pressure, and the examination remained stable, the EVD was removed. A fourth sonographic assessment was performed 24 hours after removal, with 1 final assessment before discharge of the patient.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 6 patients underwent the placement of an EVD, surgical clipping, and sonographic weaning of the EVD. Adequate sonographic visualization of the ventricles for EVD weaning was obtained in all 6 patients. Sonographic increase in ventricular size, accompanied by clinical deterioration, was observed in 3 patients, leading to the decision to place a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. There were no instances of missed ventricular enlargement nor postoperative infection or need for revision within the mean follow-up period of 6 weeks.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Bedside sonographic ventricular monitoring through a sonolucent cranial implant represents a new and valid method for weaning of EVD after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Using ultrasound instead of computed tomography offers several advantages, including enhanced safety by avoiding intrahospital transport, reduced costs, and elimination of radiation exposure.",Rychen J; Ferreira C; Thomas G; Croft Z; Abramyan A; Ferreira MY; Bertani R; Zhigin V; Shlifer A; Ben-Shalom N; Sy HL; Langer DJ,"Department of Neurosurgery, Lenox Hill Hospital, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Northwell Health, New York , New York , USA.","Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2025-06-16,10.1227/ons.0000000000001669,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cerebral ventricles; ultrasound; External Ventricular Drain; Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage; Sonolucent Implant
40539948,Comparison of Two Methods of Deep Brain Stimulation Lead Reconstruction and Their Prediction Capacities.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology has become increasingly advanced, and tools capable of optimizing programming are necessary. Three-dimensional (3D) electrode imaging reconstruction has the potential to assist clinicians in selecting the most effective DBS contacts. In this study, we evaluated the predictive capacity of two different methods (Matlab software [Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA] and Brainlab software [Brainlab, Munich, Germany]) in identifying effective DBS contacts, compared with clinical examination (the standard of care). The study also analyzes whether one method is superior.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Overall, 29 patients were included: 27 with Parkinson's disease (PD) and two with dystonia (DT). Therefore, images of the 58 brain hemispheres were obtained. Of these, 56 had directional leads, and two had leads with eight-ring contacts. Electrode reconstruction was performed using Matlab software and Brainlab software. The anatomic relationship between the electrodes and the targets (subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus) was analyzed. Contacts within the sweet spot of the target were chosen through 3D reconstruction visualization. In addition, if the best contact levels were directional, the best located directional contacts were chosen (this was possible in 40 leads). The best contact was defined as that with the highest motor symptoms improvement rate based on clinical examination (standard of care).<h4>Results</h4>The mean age of the patients was 56 years; 24 patients underwent surgery within ≤one year from the surgery, and the maximum time from surgery was three years. The difference in contact-level suggestion was only one hemisphere, with Matlab software correctly suggesting the best clinical contact in 83% (48/58) and Brainlab software in 84% (49/58). The suggestion capacity of the directional contacts was 80% for both methods. Furthermore, there was a 94.8% concordance rate between the two methods (55/58) on choosing the best contacts on the basis of image reconstruction.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Matlab software and Brainlab software are effective image reconstruction methods for accurately suggesting the best contact on the basis of clinical examination.",Barbosa RMG; Yamamoto JYS; Soares MC; Paraguay IBB; Casagrande SCB; Lapa JDDS; Bezerra MER; Torezani GS; Holanda VM; Micheli GC; Barbosa ER; Cury RG,"Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

40522706,The Role of Acoustic Parameters in Droplet Vaporization of Perfluoropentane Nanodroplets for &lt;i&gt;In Vivo&lt;/i&gt; Applications.,"Nanodroplets have emerged as promising contrast agents due to their ability to undergo acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV), enabling size expansion for diverse biological applications such as selective contrast enhancement and localized drug delivery. While ADV has been widely utilized, the influence of acoustic parameters on its dynamics remains poorly understood, despite their potential to modulate ADV efficiency and uniformity, particularly with focused ultrasound (FUS). In this study, we developed a well-defined synthetic and characterization protocol for anionic perfluoropentane (PFP) nanodroplets and systematically investigated the effects of the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and cycle number on ADV using acoustic signal detection and B-mode ultrasound imaging. In addition, we developed a modified acoustic-thermal model and simulation framework to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing ADV behavior. Our findings reveal that increasing PRF and cycle number independently lowers ADV thresholds until reaching a saturation point, indicating that excessive ultrasound intensity is unnecessary. The acoustic conditions (PRF = 1000 Hz; cycle number = 175) were successfully applied <i>in vivo</i>, yielding substantial brightness enhancement at both low (0.129) and high (1.4) imaging mechanical indices (MIs), with improved parenchyma (1.86-fold) and vascular (2.21-fold) visualization. This study underscores the critical role of acoustic parameters in achieving precise and controlled ADV, paving the way for nanodroplet-based theranostics in clinical applications.",Eom T; Park JH; Pyun JY; Park M; Lee J; Park E; Choi W; Han S; Lee S; Lee BC; Yoo D,"Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, and Institute of Chemical Processes, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2025-06-16,10.1021/acsami.5c05638,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Focused ultrasound; Acoustic Parameters; Acoustic Droplet Vaporization; Nanodroplet; Perfluoropentane
40521907,Complex Single-Stage Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma Resection: A Hybrid Pediatric Endoscopic Endonasal and Transmaxillary Approach.,"<h4>Background and importance</h4>Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a rare, locally aggressive vascular tumor that primarily affect adolescent males. This work illustrates a step-by-step surgical approach of an advanced-stage JNA resection in a prepubescent 5-year-old child, utilizing a hybrid endoscopic endonasal and transmaxillary approach that provides highly effective results without employing traditional open techniques.<h4>Clinical presentation</h4>A previously healthy 5-year-old male presented with one-year history of nasal obstruction, mouth breathing, and recurrent otitis media. The patient was found to have a large, space-occupying hypervascular tumor obstructing the nasopharynx. Preoperative radiographic imaging revealed an extensive heterogeneous, avidly enhancing mass that occupied the nasopharynx, right pterygopalatine fossa, infratemporal fossa, masticator space, and middle cranial fossa. Following superselective endovascular embolization, a hybrid endoscopic endonasal approach was planned for JNA resection, incorporating an anterior maxillotomy to allow for direct access to lateral compartments not classically amenable to conventional transnasal corridors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of a combined endoscopic endonasal and transmaxillary approach for single-stage JNA resection with intracranial extension in pediatric patients. Key principles include tumor embolization, dynamic endoscopic visualization, avoidance of brain retraction, direct access to critical neurovascular structures, and minimizing craniofacial morbidity.",Valencia-Sanchez BA; Plata HF; Brandel MG; Kim JD; Levy D; Nation JJ; Pannell JS; Levy ML; Patel VA,"Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Mayo Clinic in Florida, Jacksonville , Florida , USA.","Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2025-06-16,10.1227/ons.0000000000001662,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Endoscopic; Pediatric; Skull base; Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma; Nasal Mass; Jna
40522808,Ultra-low-field Balanced Steady-state Free Precession MRI at 0.05 Tesla.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The high cost and limited accessibility of MRI scanners remain significant barriers to their broader use in clinical settings. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging at ultra-low-field (ULF) on a highly simplified and low-cost 0.05 Tesla whole-body MRI scanner.<h4>Methods</h4>Experiments were conducted using a newly developed 0.05 Tesla MRI scanner that employed a permanent magnet without the need for magnetic or radiofrequency shielding. We optimized the bSSFP protocol for imaging the brain, spine, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and knee in healthy volunteers. We also examined the dependency of tissue contrast on the excitation flip angle.<h4>Results</h4>The bSSFP protocols demonstrated reasonable image quality at 0.05 Tesla, allowing visualization of various anatomical structures. The protocols provided a spatial resolution of 2×2×6 mm3 with approximately 5 minutes of scan time per protocol. Good soft tissue contrasts were shown, facilitating the identification of major tissue types within each structure. Although bSSFP exhibited predominantly T2/T1 contrast, it could be adjusted to some extent by varying the flip angle.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The bSSFP sequence is particularly effective for imaging at ULF due to the substantially decreased tissue T1 values. This study demonstrates that imaging various anatomical structures with bSSFP at 0.05 Tesla is efficient and feasible.<h4>Significance</h4>Such bSSFP protocol benefits from ULF and can provide superior soft tissue contrasts compared to CT and ultrasound. This ULF bSSFP approach may offer a cost-effective alternative for imaging soft tissues in clinical settings lacking traditional MRI access.",Ding Y; Vardhanabhuti V; Huang F; Xiao L; Su S; Hu J; Zhang J; Lau V; Man C; Zhao Y; Leong ATL; Wu EX,,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2025-06-16,10.1109/tbme.2025.3580111,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40538272,The Interplay of Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis in Non-Stabilized Incomplete Tibial Fractures: A Temporal Study in Rats.,"Prior research on angiogenesis and osteogenesis during bone fracture healing has primarily focused on stabilized models, often within controlled environments. However, the dynamic interplay of these processes in the context of long bone fractures without scaffolds or external factors remains poorly understood. This study investigated the temporal dynamics of angiogenesis and osteogenesis in a non-stabilized incomplete transverse tibia bone fracture model. Multi-modal observation approach was carried out using micro-CT analysis of bone mineral density, histological assessment of fracture healing, and confocal microscopy for visualization and co-localization of key angiogenic (CD31, endomucin) and osteogenic (collagen 1, osteocalcin, PDGFRB) markers. Our findings revealed a dynamic and interdependent relationship between these processes. H type blood vessels persisted throughout the healing process, and significant correlations were observed between the expression of angiogenic and osteogenic markers. The role of hypoxia, a critical regulator of both processes, was investigated by analyzing HIF1-α expression. Increased expression of SLIT3, a guidance molecule, was also observed at later stages of healing, suggesting its potential involvement in vascular remodeling. These findings provide crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying bone fracture repair in the absence of additional supporting external elements such as scaffolds or stabilizers. By elucidating the temporal dynamics of these key processes, we identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at accelerating and optimizing bone regeneration. Consideration of these interactions can lead to the development of effective clinical strategies for enhancing bone healing in non-stabilized incomplete fractures.",Kim KW; Padalhin AR; Ryu HS; Abueva C; Park SY; Bae JS; Yoo SH; Seo HH; Chung PS; Gong HS; Woo SH,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Dankook University College of Medicine, Dankook University Hospital, Cheonan, Republic of Korea.",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,2025-06-20,10.1002/jor.70006,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Vascularization; Angiogenesis‐osteogenesis Coupling; Non‐stabilized Long Bone Fracture
40542073,Quantitative comparison of a novel swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography device with three established systems.,"Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) has become an essential non-invasive imaging technique for high-resolution visualization of retinal microvasculature. This study evaluates the performance of a novel Swept-Source OCTA device, Intalight DREAM, compared to established systems: Heidelberg Spectralis, Topcon Triton, and Zeiss Cirrus. We assessed acquisition time and microvascular parameters in the superficial (SCP) and deep (DCP) capillary plexuses using the OCTA Vascular Analyser algorithm for standardized image analysis across devices on 30 eyes from 15 healthy participants. In the SCP, DREAM demonstrated a higher median vessel length (47 μm) and greater fractal dimension (mean: 1.999) than the other devices, indicating enhanced continuity and network complexity. In the DCP, DREAM showed a smaller foveal avascular zone (median: 0.339 mm<sup>2</sup>) compared to Spectralis (0.51 mm<sup>2</sup>), Triton (0.5935 mm<sup>2</sup>), and Cirrus (0.9145 mm<sup>2</sup>), along with a smaller vessel diameter (median: 23 μm) compared to Triton and Cirrus. With a median imaging time of 9.1 s, DREAM was significantly faster than the Spectralis system (23.3 s) while providing largely comparable image quality, enhancing patient comfort, and potentially minimizing motion artifacts. These findings suggest that DREAM OCT is a promising tool for deep retinal imaging, with strong potential for clinical application and research.",Hafner M; Priglinger SG; von Livonius B; Gerhardt MJ,"Department of Ophthalmology, LMU University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Mathildenstraße 8, 80336, Munich, Germany.

40537672,Pelvic nerve endometriosis: MRI features and key findings for surgical decision.,"Endometriosis is a prevalent gynecological disorder in women of reproductive age. It is the leading cause of chronic pelvic pain. While the mechanisms underlying this pain remain elusive, rare cases of pelvic nerve involvement can result in severe, debilitating symptoms, adding complexity to the clinical landscape. Nerve involvement typically results from the direct extension of deep infiltrating endometriosis, though it may also occur in isolation. The nerves most commonly affected include the inferior hypogastric and lumbosacral plexuses, as well as the sciatic, pudendal, obturator, and femoral nerves. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for the effective management of the pain and the prevention of irreversible nerve damage. Given the limitations of transvaginal ultrasonography in visualizing the lateral compartment, MRI is considered the gold standard for detecting and evaluating pelvic nerve involvement. Through the use of optimized protocols to enhance the visualization of nerves and their anatomical landmarks, radiologists play a key role in the identification of endometriotic lesions. A comprehensive and structured radiology report is essential for surgical planning, as nerve involvement often requires precise interventions to alleviate symptoms and restore quality of life. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Accurate identification and a structured reporting of pelvic nerve endometriosis in the lateral compartment are pivotal to guide surgical decision-making and optimize patient outcomes. KEY POINTS: Pelvic nerve endometriosis is often overlooked, underestimated by clinicians, and underdiagnosed on imaging. Timely nerve involvement diagnosis prevents permanent damage in pelvic pain with neurological symptoms. Deep endometriosis in the lateral compartment may extend to the pelvic nerves. The inferior hypogastric plexus, sacral plexus, sciatic, and pudendal nerves are commonly affected. A dedicated MRI protocol with 3D T2-weighted sequence ensures accurate pelvic nerve assessment.",Bourg J; Ruaux E; Bolze PA; Gavrel M; Charlot M; Golfier F; Thomassin-Naggara I; Rousset P,"Department of Radiology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon Sud University Hospital, Lyon 1 Claude Bernard University, Pierre Bénite, France.",Insights into imaging,2025-06-19,10.1186/s13244-025-02005-6,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Endometriosis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pelvic Pain; Pelvic Plexus
40533792,Efficacy of arthroscopic deep rotator cuff suture with spinal needle for rotator cuff repair in treating rotator cuff tears.,"<h4>Background</h4>In arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, satisfactory postoperative outcomes can be achieved by simplifying the surgical procedure and ensuring proper integration of the deep rotator cuff tissue with the footprint area for tendon reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term efficacy of arthroscopic spinal needle sutures for the repair of rotator cuff tears.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study included a cohort of 81 patients with rotator cuff tears who underwent arthroscopic suture repair using a spinal needle between January 2021 and March 2021, with a minimum follow-up duration of 27 months. Pre- and postoperative Constant-Murley Score (CMS), University of California-Los Angeles Shoulder Score (UCLASS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, and range of motion (ROM) measurements, including active forward flexion, abduction, and lateral rotation angles, were compared to assess shoulder anatomy, function, strength, and subjective patient satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>Statistically significant improvements were observed in CMS, UCLASS, VAS, and ROM postoperatively (P = 0.000). The excellent or good outcome rate was 81.48%. Age and preoperative ROM significantly influenced outcomes (P = 0.039 and P = 0.006), respectively, whereas gender and pain duration did not show a significant effect (P > 0.05).

40528286,Clinical Significance of Real-Time Guidance Using the ICG Fluorescent Rim on the Resection Plane During Liver Parenchymal Transection.,"<h4>Background</h4>Determining tumor location during laparoscopic hepatectomy is challenging due to the lack of direct liver palpation and limitations of intraoperative ultrasound. Advances in indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging have significantly enhanced real-time visualization during hepatectomy, aiding in tumor detection and guiding resection margins. The present study assessed the clinical relevance of the detection by real-time ICG imaging of a fluorescent rim on the cut surface of the liver in determining resection margins in patients undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy for malignant liver tumors.<h4>Methods</h4>The present study evaluated patients who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy using ICG fluorescence imaging from April 2020 to April 2023. If a fluorescent rim was detected on the cut surface of the liver during parenchymal transection, adjustments were made to the resection plane to ensure proper tumor clearance. The surgical transection plane was guided by real-time ICG fluorescence imaging, ensuring precise resection margins.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 300 patients who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy using ICG fluorescence imaging, 20 were positive for an ICG fluorescent rim on the cut surface of the liver during parenchymal transection. The median tumor size was 26 mm (range: 4-52 mm), and the median resection margin was 4.5 mm (range: 0.8-10 mm). The median postoperative hospital stay was 6 days (range: 5-21 days).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study confirmed the preliminary safety of ICG fluorescence imaging in guiding resection margins during laparoscopic liver resection and provides technical insights into parenchymal preservation.",Kim JH; Park HM,"Center for Liver and Pancreatobiliary Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang-si, Korea.",World journal of surgery,2025-06-17,10.1002/wjs.12665,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Laparoscopic Liver Resection; Icg Fluorescent Imaging; Parenchymal Sparing Liver Resection
40531514,A Novel Microsurgical Model of Cervical Lymph Node-to-Vein Anastomosis (LNVA) for Studying Brain Lymphatic Outflow.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cervical lymphaticovenous bypass has recently emerged as an innovative surgical approach to enhance brain lymphatic clearance for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). Although early clinical findings are promising, the absence of a reproducible preclinical model has hindered mechanistic investigations and translational advancements.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to establish the first rat model for cervical LVA, addressing technical challenges and providing a standardized platform for preclinical research on lymphatic clearance and its role in neurodegeneration.<h4>Methods</h4>Rats underwent bilateral cervical LNVA using high-magnification supermicrosurgical techniques. After identification of the deep cervical lymph nodes, end-to-side lymph node-to-venous anastomosis was performed. Anastomotic patency was confirmed intraoperatively by direct visualization without leakage. Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphangiography, performed through nasal administration, demonstrated fluorescence drainage into the external jugular vein.<h4>Results</h4>With progressive refinement of microsurgical skills and improved anatomic familiarity, procedural stability was achieved. In the final cohort of 5 rats, all LVA procedures resulted in successful anastomotic patency.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study is the first to establish a rat model of cervical deep lymph node-venous anastomosis (LNVA), offering a novel microsurgical platform with dual value. On one hand, it serves as a technically demanding and reproducible model for advanced training in plastic and lymphatic surgery. On the other, it provides a structurally precise, gain-of-function approach for targeted intervention of the deep cervical lymph nodes-an anatomic hub increasingly implicated in brain lymphatic clearance and neurodegeneration.
