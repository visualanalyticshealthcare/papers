41205456,Machine learning-assisted dual-amplified visual platform based on fluorescent metal-organic framework and photonic crystals enables ATP detection for pathogen monitoring.,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an important energy currency for maintaining life activities, has been widely regarded as a biomarker of disease diagnosis and an indicator of microbial contamination. However, most of the current ATP recognition relies on the specific recognition of aptamer or luciferase, which is prone to degradation and inactivation; and professional equipment is still needed for the signal output. Hence, it still remains challenging to achieve reliable and convenient detection of ATP in an equipment-free way. Herein, we developed a machine learning (ML)-assisted dual-amplified visual platform based on fluorescence metal-organic framework and photonic crystals (PCs) for the visualized and quantitative analysis of free and microbial ATP. Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs)-loaded zeolitic imidazole frameword-8 (ZIF-8) possessed enhanced fluorescence, which could specifically recognize ATP to produce signal variation. Benefiting from PCs-based fluorescence enhancement, visualization and quantification of ATP or E. coli with higher sensitivity could be achieved by capturing fluorescent images and analyzing digital color values. By detecting microbial ATP, E. coli level could be visualized and quantified with a wider linear range of 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> CFU mL<sup>-1</sup> and a lower LOD of 3.54 CFU mL<sup>-1</sup>. The validation with E. coli-spiked complicated samples confirmed the feasibility and practical applicability of this sensing platform. Furthermore, five different ML models are designed for the regression quantification of ATP or E. coli with good predictive performance, offering an effective tool for food safety monitoring and clinical diagnosis.",Ren J; Yang X; Wen Z; Gao X; Jin F; Wang Y,"Institute of Biomedical Precision Testing and Instrumentation, College of Artificial Intelligence, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030024, PR China.",Biosensors & bioelectronics,2025-11-05,10.1016/j.bios.2025.118202,10.7,"visualization(abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract)",Pathogenic bacteria; Photonic Crystals; Machine Learning; Visual Detection; Gold Nanoclusters; Zif-8 Framework

41206476,AMRnet: a data visualization platform to interactively explore pathogen variants and antimicrobial resistance.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a substantial threat to global public health. Whole genome sequencing is increasingly used as a core method for pathogen characterization to support AMR surveillance. As a result, a vast amount of bacterial sequence data are available in public archives, yet the AMR-related information they encode is not readily accessible to those without bioinformatics expertise and is essentially invisible to policy makers. The AMRnet platform aims to make publicly available genome-derived AMR data accessible to a diverse user base. The underlying data are drawn from public genomic databases and used to calculate pooled estimates of national annual prevalence that can be visualized interactively, and broken down and explored in terms of underlying pathogen variants, resistance mechanisms, and geographic and temporal distributions. Users can download dynamically generated reports, summary and line-list data from the web-based dashboard (https://www.amrnet.org), and query the database via application programming interface. For selected organisms, data are curated for purpose of sampling, to reduce the public data bias towards sequencing of resistant or severe infections. By improving the accessibility and utility of publicly archived data, AMRnet aims to encourage wider sequencing initiatives and collaborative data-sharing efforts while providing crucial data insights for researchers and policy makers.",Cerdeira LT; Dyson ZA; Sharma V; Maranga M; Foster-Nyarko E; Carey ME; Holt KE,"Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom.",Nucleic acids research,2025-11-06,10.1093/nar/gkaf1101,8.8,"visualization(title); dashboard(abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(title,abstract); informatics(abstract)",
41201780,Artificial Intelligence for Spleen-Stomach Disorders in Traditional Chinese Medicine: Integrating Knowledge Graphs with Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment.,"Spleen-Stomach disorders are prevalent clinical conditions in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The complex diagnostic and treatment model used in TCM is based on a ""symptom-pattern-disease-formula"" framework that heavily relies on practitioners' experience. However, this model faces several challenges, including ambiguous knowledge representation, unstructured data, and difficulties with knowledge sharing. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and medical knowledge engineering have significantly improved research on knowledge graphs (KGs) and intelligent diagnosis and treatment systems for these disorders, making these technologies crucial for modernizing TCM. This article systematically reviews two core research pathways related to Spleen-Stomach disorders. The first pathway focuses on constructing knowledge graphs for ""structured knowledge representation"". This includes ontology modeling, entity recognition, relation extraction, graph fusion, semantic reasoning, visualization services, and an ensemble model to predict treatment efficacy. The second pathway involves the development of intelligent diagnosis and treatment systems, with a focus on ""clinical applications"". This pathway includes key technologies such as quantitative modeling of TCM, the four diagnostic methods (inspection, auscultation-olfaction, interrogation, and palpation), semantic analysis of classical texts, pattern differentiation algorithms, and multimodal consultation recommenders. Through the synthesis and analysis of current research, several ongoing challenges have been identified. These include inconsistent models and annotation of TCM clinical knowledge, limited semantic reasoning capabilities, insufficient integration between KGs and intelligent diagnostic models, and limited clinical adaptability of existing intelligent diagnostic systems. To address these challenges, this review suggests future research directions that include enhancing heterogeneous multisource knowledge integration techniques, deepening semantic reasoning through collaborative reasoning frameworks that incorporate large language models, and developing effective cross-disease transfer learning strategies. These directions aim to improve interpretability, reasoning accuracy, and clinical applicability of intelligent diagnosis and treatment systems for Spleen-Stomach disorders in TCM.",Duan YY; Jia SF; Ye S; Cheang L; Tai W; Xiang LZ; Ye ZW,"Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, 430061, China.",Current medical science,2025-11-07,10.1007/s11596-025-00128-x,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(title,abstract); data(abstract); informatics(kw)",Syndrome Differentiation; Natural Language Processing; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Intelligent Diagnosis And Treatment; Spleen-stomach Disorders; Traditional Chinese Medicine Informatics

The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132 radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning (ML) modeling algorithms were implemented, respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization and evaluated the calibration curve and decision curve.<h4>Results</h4>By comparing six modeling strategies, the Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a training AUROC of 1.00 and a testing AUROC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were significantly associated with EC (p < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. Decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated a higher net benefit for our model compared to the ""All"" and ""None"" strategies, suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing unnecessary interventions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CT radiomics-based explainable ML model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.",Zhang T; Wu H; Jiang Z; Wang Y; Ye R; Ni H; Liu C; Cao J; Sun X; Shao R; Wei X; Sun Y,"Gynecology Department, Qingdao Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Qingdao Hiser Hospital Affiliated of Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266000, China.",Biomedical engineering online,2025-11-04,10.1186/s12938-025-01462-w,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",CT; Endometrial Cancer; Personalized Medicine; Machine Learning; Radiomics
41184849,Interpretable machine learning model for predicting low birth weight in singleton pregnancies: a retrospective cohort study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Low birth weight (LBW), defined as a newborn weighing less than 2500 g, is an increasingly significant public health concern. Exploring the risk and protective factors for LBW is getting more and more important. This study aimed to utilize predictive models to identify the critical factors associated with LBW in singleton pregnancies.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Binzhou Medical University Hospital, China, from 2022 to 2023. Singleton pregnancies with gestational age exceeding 27 weeks were included, while multiple pregnancies and fetal anomalies were excluded. Logistic regression (LR) model and four machine learning (ML) algorithms were tested(random forest, light gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting). The LR model was interpreted through odds ratio analysis and clinical nomogram visualization. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was used to interpret the importance and impact of individual features on ML model.<h4>Results</h4>In this cohort of 10,227 deliveries, 237 cases were classified as LBW. The XGBoost model exhibited superior performance in predicting LBW, with an AUC of 0.786 (training set) and 0.741 (test set, ) AUPRC of 0.350 and 0.186, respectively. Both LR and XGBoost model identified maternal age, gestational age, BMI, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), fetal distress as the critical factor. Additionally, a follow-up study on LBW found that LBW infants prone to significant health challenges, such as a high rate of hospitalization and the complex conditions including congenital anomalies, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study demonstrated that the LR and XGBoost model exhibited clinically meaningful predictive performance in identifying factors associated with LBW in singleton pregnancies.

41188293,Artificial intelligence-based method for detecting wrist fractures in children.,"Pediatric wrist fractures are common skeletal injuries in clinical practice; however, due to the ongoing development of children's bones, fracture characteristics are complex and often prone to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. Moreover, traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on the physician's experience, which may compromise efficiency and accuracy, especially in environments with limited medical resources. To address this issue, this study proposes an improved deep learning detection method based on YOLO11s, named Kid-YOLO, for the automatic detection of pediatric wrist fractures in X-ray images. By introducing the C3k2-WTConv module and Focaler-MPDIoU loss function, the model was improved in terms of multi-scale feature extraction, target box localization accuracy optimization, and addressing the class imbalance problem. The C3k2-WTConv module, which combines wavelet transform and convolution operations, effectively enhances the model's ability to detect subtle fractures and complex patterns. The Focaler-MPDIoU loss function improves performance in detecting rare targets by dynamically adjusting sample weight distribution and optimizing prediction box positioning. Experiments were conducted on the publicly available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset after data cleaning, The results show that, compared with the YOLO11 model, the improved model achieves a 3.2% increase in precision, a 1.6% increase in recall, a 1.8% improvement in mAP@50, and a 3.2% improvement in mAP@50-95. Furthermore, this study developed an AI-assisted diagnostic system with an integrated graphical user interface, capable of efficiently performing image loading, fracture detection, and result visualization, thereby providing physicians with a reliable diagnostic tool. In the future, this method is expected to be applied to a broader range of medical imaging analysis tasks, offering new technical support for precision medicine.",Liu D; Yang Z; Bao C; Meng Q,"School of Sports Health, Tianjin University of Sport, Tianjin, China.",Scientific reports,2025-11-04,10.1038/s41598-025-22419-y,6.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,title); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Radiology; Pediatric Wrist Fractures; C3k2-wtconv; Focaler-mpdiou; Yolo11

41191210,MOL classification: a novel meiotic spindle scoring system for predicting human embryo development and ploidy.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aimed to develop a comprehensive scoring system for assessing the human oocyte meiotic spindle (MS) to predict embryological outcomes from both fresh and cryopreserved oocytes.<h4>Methods</h4>Human oocytes were evaluated using polarized light microscopy before and after cryopreservation. Each oocyte was scored using the MOL system, which assigns a three-digit code reflecting MS Morphology, Orientation, and Localization. Morphology categories included barrel-shaped, altered, enlarged, poor visualization, or absence of MS. Orientation was assessed in relation to the first polar body (PB1), and localization was measured by angular displacement from the PB1. Changes in MS characteristics due to cryopreservation were recorded, and their associations with fertilization and euploid blastocyst development were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>Cryopreservation led to observable alterations in MS morphology, orientation, and localization, resulting in a redistribution of variants across the MOL classification. A strong correlation was found between specific MOL scores and the likelihood of successful fertilization and chromosomally normal embryo development. Each MOL category variant showed distinct predictive value for embryological outcomes in both fresh and cryopreserved oocytes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The MOL scoring system provides a reliable, structured approach for predicting oocyte fertilization capacity and embryo developmental potential. Its applicability to both fresh and cryopreserved oocytes, along with its potential for automation, suggests significant clinical value in assisted reproductive technologies. Furthermore, the structured and quantifiable data generated by the MOL scoring system offer a valuable foundation for training machine learning models aimed at enhancing predictive accuracy and supporting decision-making in embryo selection.",Buderatska N; Gontar J; Yurchuk A; Ilyin I; Petrushko M; Yurchuk T,"Medical Centre ""IGR"", Kyiv, Ukraine.",Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,2025-11-05,10.1007/s10815-025-03710-3,6.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Euclidean distance; Machine Learning; Oocyte Cryopreservation; K-means; Blastocyst Development; Oocyte Meiotic Spindle
40967756,Fully Automated Image-Based Multiplexing of Serial PET/CT Imaging for Facilitating Comprehensive Disease Phenotyping.,"Combined PET/CT imaging provides critical insights into both anatomic and molecular processes, yet traditional single-tracer approaches limit multidimensional disease phenotyping; to address this, we developed the PET Unified Multitracer Alignment (PUMA) framework-an open-source, postprocessing tool that multiplexes serial PET/CT scans for comprehensive voxelwise tissue characterization. <b>Methods:</b> PUMA utilizes artificial intelligence-based CT segmentation from multiorgan objective segmentation to generate multilabel maps of 24 body regions, guiding a 2-step registration: affine alignment followed by symmetric diffeomorphic registration. Tracer images are then normalized and assigned to red-green-blue channels for simultaneous visualization of up to 3 tracers. The framework was evaluated on longitudinal PET/CT scans from 114 subjects across multiple centers and vendors. Rigid, affine, and deformable registration methods were compared for optimal coregistration. Performance was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient for organ alignment and absolute percentage differences in organ intensity and tumor SUV<sub>mean</sub> <b>Results:</b> Deformable registration consistently achieved superior alignment, with Dice similarity coefficient values exceeding 0.90 in 60% of organs while maintaining organ intensity differences below 3%; similarly, SUV<sub>mean</sub> differences for tumors were minimal at 1.6% ± 0.9%, confirming that PUMA preserves quantitative PET data while enabling robust spatial multiplexing. <b>Conclusion:</b> PUMA provides a vendor-independent solution for postacquisition multiplexing of serial PET/CT images, integrating complementary tracer data voxelwise into a composite image without modifying clinical protocols.

41202530,Multi-modal deep learning for predicting functional outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage using 3D CT and clinical data.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to construct and validate a novel multimodal deep learning framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images and clinical text information from the early admission phase to accurately predict functional outcomes at 90 days post-onset in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study includes 508 ICH patients from two medical centers, divided into a training-validation cohort (n = 391) and an external test cohort (n = 117). We propose a multimodal model utilizing a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract imaging features and a pre-trained language model (BioClinicalBERT) to encode semantic information from clinical text. The features from these two modalities are deeply integrated via a dual-stream attention mechanism. Functional outcomes are assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), with a good prognosis defined as mRS < 3 and a poor prognosis as mRS ≥ 3. Model performance is evaluated through comparisons with single-modality baseline models and validated on an independent external dataset. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is employed for visualization to enhance model interpretability.<h4>Results</h4>In internal cross-validation, the multimodal model achieved an accuracy of 0.867 ± 0.027 and an AUC of 0.899 ± 0.015; in comparison, the image-only model obtained an accuracy of 0.696 ± 0.063 and an AUC of 0.718 ± 0.077. On the external test set, the proposed multimodal model reached an accuracy of 0.821 (95 % CI: 0.752-0.889) and an AUC of 0.846 (95 % CI: 0.769-0.919), whereas the image-only model achieved an accuracy of 0.675 (95 % CI: 0.581-0.761, P < 0.05) and an AUC of 0.737 (95 % CI: 0.637-0.821, P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed framework effectively integrates 3D CT imaging and clinical text data to accurately predict long-term functional outcomes in ICH patients.

41192043,Microbiome based precision medicine through integrated multiomics and machine learning.,"Gut microbiome (GME) is a dynamic ecosystem composed of diverse microorganisms with extensive functional potential that influence host physiology, endocrinology, and neurology. This review explores how multiomics (m<sup>OMICS</sup>) and machine learning (ML) enhance understanding of the GME and its implications for human disease and therapy. Integrating metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics with ML enables the linkage of microbial composition and function to clinical outcomes. Combined m<sup>OMICS</sup> approaches elucidate species and strain dynamics, metabolic pathways, and metabolite production within the gut environment. Techniques such as shotgun metagenomics, metagenome-assembled genomes, and pathway mapping reveal associations between dysbiosis and diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, cardiometabolic, and neurological disorders. Mechanistic insights highlight short-chain fatty acids in immune regulation, bile acid transformations in metabolic signaling, and trimethylamine N-oxide in cardiovascular risk. ML models trained on heterogeneous datasets identify disease-related microbial modules, improve patient stratification, and predict therapeutic responses, such as differentiating IBD subtypes and detecting cancer-linked microbial signatures. Network analyses uncover gut microbial interaction patterns influencing host physiology. Emerging integrative tools like MOFA+ , DIABLO, and MintTea strengthen cross-modal analysis and biomarker discovery. Standardized workflows addressing quality control, assembly, binning, annotation, and visualization ensure reproducibility. Together, m<sup>OMICS</sup> and ML establish a robust framework for translating GME ecology into clinically relevant biomarkers and precision interventions.

41198822,Parkinson's disease severity clustering based on gait activity from mobile device.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms, including gait impairments, which significantly affect patient mobility and quality of life. An accurate assessment of the severity of PD is crucial for clinical management. This study investigates the utility of smartphone-derived gait data to objectively cluster PD severity using unsupervised machine learning, with the aim of improving precision in disease monitoring. We analyze gait data from the mPower dataset, comprising 8779 accelerometer recordings from 1957 participants (PD patients and healthy controls). Stride cycles were segmented using frequency analysis and peak detection, followed by sequence padding to standardize input lengths. K-means clustering with dynamic time warping (DTW) was applied to identify gait patterns, while autoencoder embeddings and t-SNE visualized high-dimensional data. The groups were correlated with the MDS-UPDRS scores (Parts I and II) to assess severity. Four distinct gait clusters were identified, correlating with the severity of PD. The most severe group (Cluster 1) exhibited significantly higher MDS-UPDRS scores for balance/walking problems (2.43×) and freezing episodes (8.41×) compared to the least severe group (Cluster 4). The visualization of t-SNE confirmed the clear separation of the clusters, with higher severity scores concentrated in cluster 1. Sequence padding showed no significant impact on clustering outcomes (p > 0.05), validating its use for handling variable-length data. This study demonstrates that smartphone-derived gait patterns, analyzed via unsupervised clustering and visualization techniques, effectively stratify PD severity. Gait features related to balance, freezing, and walking difficulties are critical biomarkers for disease progression. Key advantage of our technique is the use of unsupervised learning to identify latent patterns without preconceived group assumptions, allowing subgroups to emerge organically and providing an unbiased exploration of gait-pattern relationships with Parkinson's severity. While limitations include the reliance on self-reported MDS-UPDRS data and k-means algorithm variability, these findings highlight the potential of wearable sensors and machine learning to develop objective, scalable tools for PD assessment.",Sri-Iesaranusorn P; Asawaponwiput W; Ajchariyasakchai P; Bhidayasiri R; Surangsrirat D,"Digital Healthcare Platform Innovation Group, National Science and Technology Development Agency, Pathum Thani, Thailand.",Scientific reports,2025-11-06,10.1038/s41598-025-22751-3,5.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Parkinson’s Disease; Gait Analysis; Mpower Dataset; Severity Clustering
41185007,"Hunting for a coronary artery disease diagnosis in asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus: if, how and when.","Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This population faces an increased risk of coronary artery disease due to accelerated atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation. A substantial proportion of cases remain clinically silent, with coronary artery disease often undetected until the occurrence of acute events. This silent progression poses a significant challenge for timely diagnosis and prevention. This review explores the prevalence, mechanisms, and prognosis of asymptomatic coronary artery disease in type 2 diabetes, focusing on current strategies for cardiovascular risk assessment and screening. While traditional risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia remain central to clinical evaluation, they often fail to fully capture the residual cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. Advances in imaging, particularly coronary calcium scoring and computed tomography angiography, allow for the direct visualization of total plaque burden, providing a more refined assessment of risk. Functional tests and novel biomarkers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and lipoprotein(a), further enhance the precision of risk stratification. Despite these advances, the clinical value of routine screening in asymptomatic diabetic individuals remains controversial. Evidence suggests that a selective, risk-based approach to screening may be more effective than universal testing, identifying high-risk patients who could benefit from more intensive preventive therapies. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, promise to improve risk prediction by integrating clinical, imaging, and biomarker data into personalized care pathways. The review emphasizes the need to move from a reactive approach, based on symptom-driven evaluation, to a proactive strategy aimed at early identification of subclinical disease. By combining advanced imaging techniques, biomarker profiling, and updated risk algorithms, clinicians can better tailor preventive interventions, reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and optimize long-term care.

41199600,"Vibe Coding in nephrology education: clinician-led, AI-assisted development of open-source interactive learning tools.","Medical education increasingly incorporates digital technologies; however, many tools remain passive and text-based. <i>Vibe Coding</i> is a clinician-led design framework that embeds expert reasoning and the cognitive 'feel' of clinical decision-making into interactive educational tools. This study demonstrates its application in nephrology training through the rapid development of open-source, AI-assisted, web-based applications. We conducted a proof-of-concept development study using a structured, physician-led, AI-assisted process combining (1) deconstruction of clinical algorithms, (2) natural-language-to-code generation with modern large language models, and (3) iterative refinement of user interfaces. The target audience included nephrology trainees and educators, with source content derived from peer-reviewed educational literature. Four open-source, web-based applications were developed: (1) <i>Kidney Stone Navigator</i> for 24-hour urine analysis interpretation, (2) <i>NephroFlow CKRT Clinical Copilot</i> for dose and anticoagulation management, (3) <i>Renal Tubular Acidosis Diagnostic Assistant</i> for algorithmic diagnosis, and (4) <i>Interactive Guide to Disorders of Volume</i> for dynamic visualization of pathophysiology. Each tool mirrored expert reasoning, integrated automated calculations, and was publicly released on GitHub with live deployment for global educational use. Clinician-led, AI-assisted development enables the translation of static educational materials into interactive, open-access tools.

41193801,A probabilistic histological atlas of the human brain for MRI segmentation.,"In human neuroimaging, brain atlases are essential for segmenting regions of interest (ROIs) and comparing subjects in a common coordinate frame. State-of-the-art atlases derived from histology<sup>1-3</sup> provide exquisite three-dimensional cytoarchitectural maps but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain: that is, the likelihood of each location belonging to a given ROI. Here we present NextBrain, a probabilistic histological atlas of the whole human brain. We developed artificial intelligence-enabled methods to align roughly 10,000 histological sections from five whole brain hemispheres into three-dimensional volumes and to produce delineations for 333 ROIs on these sections. We also created a companion Bayesian tool for automatic segmentation of these ROIs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We showcase two applications of the atlas: segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of Alzheimer's disease using in vivo MRI. We publicly release raw and aligned data, an online visualization tool, the atlas, the segmentation tool, and ground truth delineations for a high-resolution ex vivo hemisphere used in validation. By enabling researchers worldwide to automatically analyse brain MRIs at a higher level of granularity, NextBrain holds promise to increase the specificity of findings and accelerate our quest to understand the human brain in health and disease.",Casamitjana A; Mancini M; Robinson E; Peter L; Annunziata R; Althonayan J; Crampsie S; Blackburn E; Billot B; Atzeni A; Puonti O; Balbastre Y; Schmidt P; Hughes J; Augustinack JC; Edlow BL; Zöllei L; Thomas DL; Kliemann D; Bocchetta M; Strand C; Holton JL; Jaunmuktane Z; Iglesias JE,"Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, London, UK.",Nature,2025-11-05,10.1038/s41586-025-09708-2,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); data(abstract),
41178745,Skin Lesion Classification Using Focal Modulation Networks.,"The automatic classification of dermoscopic images is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer. However, this task remains challenging due to high visual similarity among lesion types, variations in lesion appearance across progression stages, and the presence of artifacts in the images. While deep learning-based approaches have outperformed traditional machine learning methods, many existing models are computationally intensive and offer limited interpretability. These limitations hinder their integration into clinical workflows where efficiency and transparency are critical. In this study, I propose a framework based on focal modulation networks (FMNs) for skin lesion classification. FMNs are designed to efficiently capture both local and global features, addressing the limitations of transformer-based models in processing high-resolution medical images. I evaluate four FMN variants, namely, Tiny, Small, Base, and Large, on three public datasets: ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and ISIC 2019. The highest classification accuracy was obtained on ISIC 2019 with 97.8%, followed by 96.4% on ISIC 2018, and 88.1% on ISIC 2017. These results match or exceed those reported in several previous studies. Additionally, FMNs offer model interpretability through modulator visualization. Overall, the proposed method provides an accurate, efficient, and transparent solution for automated skin lesion classification.",Zan H,"Department of Computer Engineering, Mardin Artuklu University, Mardin, Turkey.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2025-11-03,10.1111/nyas.70139,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(abstract),Skin Cancer Detection; Deep Learning; Skin Lesion Classification; Focal Modulation Networks
41190809,The Medulloblastoma Meta-Analysis Portal Enables Integrative Exploration of Clinical and Genomic Data from Patients.,"Medulloblastoma is a prevalent, highly heterogeneous malignant pediatric brain cancer. In this study, we developed the Medulloblastoma Meta-Analysis portal, a web-based data analysis and visualization platform that consolidates clinical, molecular, and survival data of 898 patients from three major clinical trials (ACNS0331, ACNS0332, and SJMB03). The portal integrated clinical data with genomic mutations and DNA methylomes, enabling in-depth analyses of tumor subgroups and survival outcomes. Dynamic exploration and custom stratification of these data were made possible by the portal's user-friendly visualization tools powered by the ProteinPaint framework, allowing users to select from a wide range of variables or customize their own. The Cox regression analysis tool in the portal demonstrated utility in examining the prognostic impact of variables across a heterogeneous dataset. Additionally, an in-depth exploration of medulloblastomas that harbor KBTBD4 mutations and their corresponding methylomes generated leads that could help improve molecular classification. These use cases underscore the portal's utility in enhancing risk stratification, informing tailored therapeutic strategies, and revealing the complexities of molecular heterogeneity in patients with medulloblastoma. The portal, along with links to the tutorials and live figures, is freely available at https://viz.stjude.cloud/st-jude-childrens-research-hospital/visualization/medulloblastoma-integrative-analysis-portal~2882.<h4>Significance</h4>The MB-meta portal facilitates risk stratification of patients using molecular, genomic, clinical, and demographic data, representing a significant step in neuro-oncology data sharing by offering an intuitive web-based platform for complex analyses.",Gangwani K; Lu C; Dhanda SK; Sioson E; Zaldívar Peraza A; Matt GY; Paul R; Wang J; Reilly C; Acić A; Smith KS; Lin T; Li Q; Northcott PA; Robinson GW; Zhou X,"Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.",Cancer research,2025-11-05,10.1158/0008-5472.can-24-4976,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",

However, current methods are generally not equipped to handle the new challenges. We describe an extension of our programs MntJULiP and Jutils for differential splicing detection and visualization from RNA-seq data that accounts for covariates. MntJULiP detects intron-level differences in both splicing ratios and splicing abundance from RNA-seq data using a Bayesian linear mixture model adjusted for covariates. Jutils visualizes alternative variation with heatmaps, sashimi plots, Venn diagrams, and, reported here, PCA maps. With covariate modeling, MntJULiP drastically reduces false positives to achieve very high precision (>90%), significantly outperforming competitors. We applied the methods to GTEx brain RNA-seq samples to deconvolute the effects of sex and age at death on the splicing patterns. In particular, analyses of frontal cortex data reveal a pattern of increased splicing differences with more distant age groups, while clustering of covariate-adjusted data identifies a subgroup of individuals undergoing a distinct splicing program over the age span.",Lui WW; Yang G; He Z; Florea L,"Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States.",NAR genomics and bioinformatics,2025-11-03,10.1093/nargab/lqaf140,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
41191251,Assessing the impact of virtual reality on surgeons' mental models of complex congenital heart cases.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Virtual reality (VR) has attracted attention in healthcare for many promising applications including pre-surgical planning. Currently, there exists a critical gap in comprehension of the impact of VR on physicians' thinking. Self-reported data from surveys and metrics based on confidence and task completion may not yield sufficiently detailed understanding of the complex decision making and cognitive load experienced by surgeons during VR-based pre-surgical planning.<h4>Methods</h4>Our research aims to address the gap in understanding the impact of VR on physicians' mental models through a novel methodology of self-directed think-aloud protocols, offering deeper perspectives into physicians' thought processes within the virtual 3D environment. We performed qualitative analysis of recorded verbalizations and actions in VR in addition to quantitative measures from the NASA task load index (NASA-TLX). Analysis was conducted to identify thematic sequences in VR which influenced clinical decision making when reviewing patient anatomy.<h4>Results</h4>We find a significant increase in reported physician confidence in understanding of the patient anatomy from before VR to after (p = 0.012) and identified several common patterns of 3D exploration of the anatomy in VR. Physicians also reported low cognitive stress on the NASA-TLX.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings indicate VR has value beyond simulating surgery, helping physicians to confirm findings from conventional medical imaging, visualize approaches with detail, and help make complex decisions while mentally preparing for surgery. These findings provide evidence that VR and related 3D visualization are helpful for pre-surgical planning of complex cases.",Bethke E; Bramlet MT; Sutton BP; Evans JL; Hanner A; Tran A; O'Rourke B; Soofi N; Amos JR,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign-Bioengineering, 1406 W Green St, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA. bethke2@illinois.edu.",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2025-11-05,10.1007/s11548-025-03542-7,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Virtual reality; Congenital Heart; Mental Model; Pre-surgical Planning
41188476,The clinical value and application of augmented reality navigation in brachial plexus schwannoma.,"This study aimed to introduce the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived augmented reality (AR) navigation in the surgical treatment of brachial plexus schwannomas and to evaluate and statistically analyze their clinical outcomes. Preoperative MRI data were converted into 3D reconstructions and AR holograms. Using mixed-reality glasses, surgeons employed these reconstructions for intraoperative tumor localization and surgical planning. Outcomes were assessed through structural visualization metrics (tumor, arteries, veins, and nerves) and clinical parameters (incision length, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, satisfaction, and Quick-DASH scores). Twelve patients (mean age 44.75 ± 3.76 years) successfully underwent tumor resection. Compared to conventional MRI, AR demonstrated superior visualization of tumors (p < 0.0001), arteries (p = 0.0004), veins (p < 0.0001) and nerves (p < 0.0001). Although there was no significant change in incision length, intraoperative blood loss and Quick-DASH, AR navigation significantly reduced operative time (p = 0.04) and improved satisfaction score (p = 0.03). AR navigation enables intuitive surgical planning to circumvent critical neurovascular structures, thereby enhancing procedural safety for brachial plexus schwannoma resection, which makes it a promising adjunctive technique.",Yu Z; Zheng W; Peng P; Zhu L; Zhao X; Hu S; Zhao H; Qiu Y,"Department of Hand Surgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.",Scientific reports,2025-11-04,10.1038/s41598-025-22565-3,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Three-dimensional reconstruction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Augmented Reality Navigation; Brachial Plexus Schwannoma
41201976,"Quadrant‑Based Comparison of UV‑Fluorescence Dermoscopy, Standard Dermoscopy, and Clinical Examination in Adults With Nail Psoriasis: A Prospective Pilot Study of 35 Patients.","<h4>Background</h4>Accurate visualization of nail-matrix psoriasis remains challenging. Ultraviolet fluorescence dermoscopy (UVF D) may enhance detection, yet rigorous comparative data are scarce.<h4>Objectives</h4>To compare the diagnostic yield of UVF D with standard dermoscopy and naked eye clinical examination for matrix and bed involvement in nail psoriasis.<h4>Methods</h4>In this single center prospective pilot study (March-July 2024), 35 consecutive adults with plaque psoriasis underwent triplicate assessment (clinical, dermoscopy, UVF D) of all fingernails. Each nail quadrant was scored for matrix NAPSI and bed NAPSI by two blinded dermatologists in randomized order. The study was powered (80 %, α = 0.05) to detect a ≥ 3 point mean difference in matrix NAPSI between modalities.<h4>Results</h4>UVF-D identified matrix involvement in 550/1 400 quadrants (39.3 %) versus 448/1 400 (32.0 %) with standard dermoscopy and 441/1 400 (31.5 %) clinically (p < 0.001; Kendall's W = 0.42). Mean ± SD matrix-NAPSI scores were 15.7 ± 5.3 (UVF-D), 12.8 ± 5.2 (dermoscopy) and 12.6 ± 4.8 (clinical). Thus, UVF-D detected roughly one additional matrix-affected quadrant for every seven examined and produced a higher matrix-NAPSI, underscoring its added sensitivity over conventional methods.<h4>Limitations</h4>Single-centre pilot (n = 35); consensus scoring precluded formal inter-observer reliability estimates; cross-sectional design prevents evaluation of treatment responsiveness; UVF-D hardware cost and user-training requirements may restrict generalisability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>UVF D significantly improves visualization of nail matrix psoriasis versus standard approaches.

Differentiating between them is challenging due to the lack of clear clinical and auxiliary test differences. In this study, we developed a novel diagnostic method combining near-infrared spectroscopy with a convolutional neural network and self-attention mechanism (CNN-SAM). The CNN-SAM model, which integrates the self-attention mechanism to highlight important spectral features, outperformed other models with 99.3% accuracy. Data pre-processing, feature extraction, and parameter optimization further enhanced the model's performance. Visualization using the self-attention mechanism revealed key spectral bands at 1364 and 1484 nm as crucial for distinguishing AD and VaD.

Despite this shared goal, the two disciplines have evolved as distinct academic fields, with limited empirical comparisons between them. Understanding their commonalities and differences can foster mutual development and cross-disciplinary collaboration. This study aims to compare research priorities in medical and dental education by analyzing author keywords from representative journals in each field.<h4>Methods</h4>A bibliometric analysis was conducted using author keywords from two medical education journals (Advances in Health Sciences Education and BMC Medical Education) and two dental education journals (European Journal of Dental Education and Journal of Dental Education) over a 10-year period (2015-2024). Data were retrieved from the Web of Science database, including only original research articles and review articles. Frequency analysis of the top 10 author keywords was performed in 2-year intervals, and bump charts were created to visualize temporal ranking changes. In addition, co-occurrence network maps were constructed using all keywords appearing 10 or more times over the study period. Data processing and visualization were conducted using VOSviewer and Tableau software.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 9391 articles were analyzed, comprising 6806 articles from medical education journals and 2585 articles from dental education journals. Both fields consistently emphasized ""students,"" ""assessment,"" and ""curriculum"" as core research topics. However, medical education placed greater emphasis on ""postgraduate medical education"" and student mental health (e.g., empathy, resilience, and depression), whereas dental education focused more on ""educational technology"" and clinical skills development (e.g., simulation, virtual reality, and psychomotor skills). The keyword ""covid-19"" emerged prominently in both fields from 2019 to 2020 onward, reflecting the pandemic's transformative impact on education. ""Interprofessional education"" appeared as a shared emerging theme, suggesting growing recognition of collaborative practice needs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identifies both foundational commonalities and discipline-specific innovations in medical and dental education research over the past decade.

41182509,Expanding horizons: the role of robotic surgery in modern transplantation practices.,"Robotic surgery has emerged as a transformative tool in modern surgical practice, offering enhanced precision, 3D visualization, and improved ergonomics. robotic-assisted procedures are increasingly being explored as viable alternatives to traditional open and laparoscopic approaches in the field of transplant medicine. We performed a structured narrative review of published literature focusing on robotic-assisted kidney transplantation (RAKT), robotic liver transplant, and recent innovations in robotic pancreas and multivisceral transplantation. Comparative clinical outcomes were summarized and key perioperative metrics were tabulated. Accordingly, we demonstrated that robotic surgery offers promising results with reduced surgical site infection (SSI) rates, shorter hospital stays, favorable graft outcomes, and recovery metrics. Besides, novel applications, such as robotic heart, lung, and bladder transplants, are entering early clinical phases, supported by advances in surgical platform.

41204045,Navigating the Future: Considerations for use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Diabetes Trials.,"<h4>Background</h4>A continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) is a digital health technology (DHT) device that measures interstitial glucose. CGMs are used in the management of diabetes. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the quality of CGM data in a clinical trial involving patients with type 1 diabetes.<h4>Methods</h4>CGM data were collected from 461 patients with type 1 diabetes who participated in a 16-week, double-blind phase 3 trial designed to examine the efficacy of prandial (mealtime) insulins. CGM data were collected at three 2 week study time points. The patterns of missing CGM data (due to non-wear, user- and device-related causes) and the relationship between CGM metrics and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) were examined using data visualization approaches.<h4>Results</h4>Across the three observation periods, 4.7-6% of CGM observations were missing. Approximately 16% of daily values were missing on days when a new CGM sensor was inserted. For many patients, high glucose variability was associated with low time in range (TIR) and HbA1c >7%. Conversely, low glucose variability was associated with higher TIR.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our analysis identified the need for adequate documentation indicating the presence of patient- and device-related events (e.g., sensor changes, non-wear time) to address causes of missing CGM data. These causes need to be considered prior to the statistical assessment of such data for research and regulatory purposes.

41188038,Abd-El-Barr's Mountain-A Radiographic Landmark for Consistent and Successful Docking in Minimally Invasive Lumbar Surgery: A Cadaveric Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Minimally invasive surgical techniques have the potential to decrease the morbidity associated with traditional open surgery. However, surgeons may hesitate to implement minimally invasive techniques in their practice due to limited direct visualization and an arduous learning curve. Minimally invasive spine surgery requires precise docking of tubular or endoscopic retractors, which is difficult because without direct visualization of surrounding structures, surgeons may find themselves unable to orient themselves. Finding consistent and reproducible radiographic landmarks may decrease barriers to adoption of MISS techniques. Abd-El-Barr's point is a novel radiographic landmark that is identified on lateral fluoroscopy to help with docking for both tubular and endoscopic spine procedures. The landmark is hypothesized to correlate closely with the caudal aspect of the lamina and serve as a reliable docking target.<h4>Objective</h4>To validate Abd-El-Barr's point as a radiographic landmark for safe, reliable, and consistent docking in minimally invasive lumbar surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>A cadaveric study design: fluoroscopic localization of Abd-El-Barr's point was performed bilaterally from L1 to S1 using a sharply pointed instrument that was inserted slightly into the lamina to mark it with a hole, followed by dissection to measure the distance between the mark and the caudal lamina.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 5 cadaveric specimen data were analyzed. The mean distance from Abd-El-Barr's point to the caudal aspect of the lamina across all measured levels and sides was 5.3 mm (bilaterally).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Abd-El-Barr's point is a reliable radiographic landmark that provides accurate and safe docking during minimally invasive lumbar decompression. Validated through anatomical dissection, it has the potential to standardize docking, provide efficient surgical workflow, and reduce variability across various surgeon experience levels.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Using this landmark as a docking point, it is hoped that surgeons can make mininally invasive spine surgery, whether tubular or endoscopic, safer and more efficient, thus helping patients recover faster.<h4>Level of evidence: 5</h4>",Alwadai M; Borrelli G; Ononogbu-Uche FC; Boukhiam M; Bartlett A; Wallace T; Saleh A; Bergin S; Zein M; Kranz P; Abd-El-Barr M,"Department of Neurosurgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.",International journal of spine surgery,2025-11-04,10.14444/8816,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Lamina; Lumbar Spine; Cadaveric Study; Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery; Spinal Endoscopy

Reliability of MF assessment and correlation with disease activity biomarkers in children is unknown. This study assessed the interrater reliability (IRR) of a binary assessment and a novel semi-quantitative index for grading MF wrapping using IUS (Chicago Mesenteric Fat Index [CMFI]) and correlation with disease activity biomarkers in pediatric patients with CD.<h4>Methods</h4>Children (≤18 years of age) with ileal CD who underwent IUS at 2 centers were enrolled. Three expert sonographers independently graded MF as present/absent and by the CMFI. IRR was calculated using Fleiss' kappa coefficient. Correlations between MF and clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers, and IUS data were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>Eighty IUS exams in 67 patients were included. The IRR was substantial for binary MF (κ = 0.744) and CMFI (κ = 0.618). Increasing CMFI grade was associated with bowel wall thickness (P < .001; odds ratio [OR], 16.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.74-46.58), presence of ileal stricture (P < .001; OR, 30.32; 95% CI, 5.74-160.15), and presence of hyperemia (P = .001; OR, 6.59; 95% CI, 2.27-19.09).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Assessment of MF on IUS is reproducible and reliable in pediatric CD.

41199430,Brain Pulsation Imaging Using Non-Balanced Steady-State Free Precession With 3D-EPI Readout.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To present a new, fast MR imaging method for visualization and quantification of pulsatile displacement in brain tissue and fluid.<h4>Methods</h4>The natural phase-contrast of non-balanced steady-state free precession combined with careful tuning of the intrinsic spoiler gradients is harnessed to measure displacement along specific physical directions. Efficient segmented 3D-EPI allows for whole brain coverage within TR = 0.15 s. Motion sensitive terms are added to the extended phase graph theory and simulations are used to optimize the sequence parameters and to calibrate the phase sensitivity. Pilot data on 4 healthy volunteers are acquired at 7T and analyzed after cardiac retrogating. A set of three 1-min scans with spoiler gradients along orthogonal axes is required to estimate full 3D displacement vectors.<h4>Results</h4>Simulations show that pulsatile displacements up to around 1 mm can be resolved with the proposed method. In vivo example data are in general agreement with predictions from simulations. The precision of the displacement measurements is estimated to be 0.01 mm using repeated scans of the same subject, and while estimated displacement values agree well with literature values for example tissue ROIs, the measurement accuracy needs to be further explored. The method provides a detailed view of the pulsatile motion along all three physical axes and with full 3D coverage of the brain.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Brain Pulsation Imaging allows for quantitative measurements of displacement vectors through the cardiac cycle with whole brain coverage within 3-5 min.

These platforms integrate online systems with offline care to extend services beyond traditional hospital settings. With the rapid expansion of internet hospitals, a new model-internet hospital plus home nursing-has developed. However, research on its implementation and effectiveness remains limited.<h4>Objective</h4>This study evaluates the implementation of the internet hospital plus home nursing model by analyzing workload, patient satisfaction, and nurses' perceptions, aiming to provide a strategic reference for its further development.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from 2459 patients who used internet hospital plus home nursing services were collected from a hospital database. The frequency of applications and service timeliness were analyzed using χ2 tests. Patient diagnoses, service types, and geographic distribution were summarized using frequency tables and visualization techniques. A simulation approach, along with the Mann-Whitney U test, was used to compare the costs of transferring patients to hospitals versus providing home nursing. Multiple linear regression identified factors associated with cost differences. Patient satisfaction across different stages was compared using a U test, and nurses' attitudes were assessed via a questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of patients were aged 60 years and older (2120/2459, 86.2%). A significant difference in application frequency was observed across age groups (χ²4=29.86; P<.001). Oncology patients were the most common users (1468/7415, 19.8%) and intravenous blood collection was the most frequent service (4899/7415, 66.1%). Most patients resided within 6 regions near the physical hospital (2119/2459, 86.2%). All patients received services within 2 days of appointment, with waiting times significantly influenced by appointment timing (χ²1 = 290.88; P<.001). Cost distributions varied significantly by gender, age, service frequency, distance, and service type (all P<.001), with service type and distance identified as key cost determinants (P<.001). Patient satisfaction was consistently high across periods, with no significant difference (Mann-Whitney U=5,090,149; P=.38). Nurses expressed positive perceptions of the model.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The internet hospital plus home nursing model effectively combines online diagnosis with in-home care, creating a closed-loop service that improves accessibility-particularly for older adults and mobility-impaired patients. Pilot implementations in Tianjin demonstrated benefits in convenience, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, alongside high patient satisfaction and nursing staff approval. Given the aging population, this model holds significant potential for broader adoption. To ensure sustainable development, enhanced safety mechanisms and policy support are recommended. As an integrated health care model with Chinese characteristics, it also offers valuable insights for the global digital health sector.",Wang Y; Liu Y; Jin Z; Jin C; Hu F; Yu T,"School of Management, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.",JMIR nursing,2025-11-05,10.2196/76761,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Effectiveness; Services; Home Nursing; Mixed-methods; Internet Hospitals
41197798,A Review of Cherenkov Imaging for Real-Time Verification in Radiation Therapy.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This paper aims to evaluate the integration of Cherenkov imaging into radiation therapy practices, focusing on its utility in enhancing treatment precision, patient safety, and clinical decision-making. The research highlights its application in quality and safety verification, breast treatment, dose visualization, confirming no radiation to unintended areas, and its broader clinical impact.<h4>Methods</h4>We employed two commercially available Cherenkov imaging systems, BeamSite and DoseRT, integrated with Varian and Elekta linear accelerators. The methodology involved real-time imaging during radiation therapy sessions for various treatments, capturing Cherenkov light with time-gated cameras synchronized with radiation pulses. Post-treatment, images were analyzed to assess treatment accuracy, dose distribution, and any deviations from the intended plan.<h4>Results</h4>Cherenkov imaging consistently provided high-quality imaging that allowed for immediate visualization of radiation dose distribution, detecting deviations in real-time, and ensuring no radiation was delivered to unintended areas. The results will be presented focusing on five main topics: quality and patient safety verification, breast treatment applications, treatment verification dose visualization, verification of negative dose in areas of concern, and observations with clinical impact. It was particularly beneficial in complex scenarios like breast cancer treatments and in cases where patient positioning was challenging. The technology facilitated immediate treatment adjustments, improved patient safety, and offered insights into treatment response without adding significant time to the clinical workflow.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Cherenkov imaging has shown substantial promise in enhancing radiation therapy by providing real-time, visual feedback on treatment delivery. It complements traditional verification methods by offering continuous monitoring, which can lead to fewer treatment errors and better patient outcomes. The findings suggest that Cherenkov imaging should be considered for broader clinical adoption to elevate the standard of care in radiation oncology, although further refinement in image processing and camera positioning could enhance its effectiveness.",Robinson A; Tallhamer M; Stieler F,"Department of Radiation Oncology, AdventHealth Celebration, Celebration Florida 34747.

41184139,Overlay of Nerve Roots to Aid in Augmented Reality-Guided L4 to L5 Transforaminal Interbody Fusion: A Methodologic Pilot.,"<h4>Background</h4>Minimally invasive transfacet transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TF-TLIF) offers advantages over open approaches, including reduced tissue disruption and faster recovery. However, limited visualization increases the risk of neural injury, particularly to the exiting nerve roots and thecal sac.<h4>Innovation</h4>This case report illustrates the integration of augmented reality (AR) to enhance real-time visualization during TF-TLIF. A 53-year-old man with symptomatic L4 to L5 spondylolisthesis underwent AR-assisted TF-TLIF. Preoperative imaging included magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and advanced neurography sequences (Multi-Echo iN Steady-state Acquisition, Short Tau Inversion Recovery, and Dixon T1), which were used to generate a 3D model of critical anatomy. A safe transfacet trajectory was planned preoperatively and overlaid onto the surgical field through the operative microscope, using intraoperative 3D imaging for registration. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring complemented visual guidance.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>AR enabled continuous visualization of neural structures during drilling, discectomy, and cage placement. The patient had no complications and was discharged on postoperative day 1 without new neurological deficits. While limited to a single case, this report demonstrates the feasibility of AR-assisted TF-TLIF. This technology may serve as a promising adjunct in minimally invasive spine surgery. Further studies are needed to assess the impact on efficiency and outcomes.<h4>Level of evidence: 4</h4>",Ghellab O; Seas A; Shaker E; Bartlett AM; Paturu M; Calebrese E; Abd-El-Barr MM,"Unit of Neurosurgery, Alouia Clinic, Birtouta, Algiers, Algeria.",International journal of spine surgery,2025-11-03,10.14444/8817,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Case Report; Augmented Reality; Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery; Transforaminal Interbody Fusion
41036585,An integrated continuous-flow microfluidic sensor for long-term monitoring of microalgae growth in a tubular photobioreactor.,"<i>Spirulina</i> (<i>Arthrospira platensis</i>) is a valuable cyanobacterium used for various applications, including health supplements, cosmetics, biofertilizers, carbon capture, and biofuels. Efficient monitoring of microalgae growth in photobioreactors is crucial for optimizing yields in large-scale culturing. Existing monitoring systems take samples from the bioreactor at different intervals and perform the visualization and quantification of algae growth parameters. In this work, a microfluidic platform is mounted on a tubular photobioreactor, and the system continuously monitors the growth behavior of <i>Spirulina</i> over several days, with algal development captured on demand. Furthermore, the microfluidic sensor is fabricated using a novel xurography-based approach on photopolymer sheets. It captures real-time micrographs of algae continuously for 5 days (over 120 hours) under two different conditions: open-loop and closed-loop. In the open-loop configuration, the sensor hydrostatically taps the algal medium from the bioreactor at regular intervals. In contrast, the closed-loop sensor continuously (24/7) circulates the culture medium through the microchip for visualization without the use of any driving mechanism. From the micrographs, algal cell density, cell count, and trichome length are estimated continuously, and all parameters exhibited an increasing trend over time. Importantly, the cell density obtained from the microfluidic sensor closely matches with the conventional benchmark glass slide method, with an error of less than 3.3%. The microfluidic monitoring platform is found to be low-cost, accurate, fast, and efficient compared to existing systems, and moreover, it is easily amenable to automation.",Rahul R; Prasad N; Mini RS; Ranjith SK,"APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, Thiruvananthapuram, 695016, Kerala, India.",Lab on a chip,2025-11-04,10.1039/d5lc00546a,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

All patients were initially treated with topical corticosteroids and antiglaucoma medications. Definitive treatment consisted of surgical extraction of the intraocular helminth after adequate control of inflammation and IOP.<h4>Results</h4>All cases presented with Uveitis, raised IOP (Glaucoma), and corneal Edema (UGE) triad, which significantly impacted initial visualization and diagnosis. A non-touch surgical technique using viscoelastic-assisted dissection and capsulorhexis forceps was employed to extract the intraocular worms. Microscopic identification confirmed the organisms as Gnathostoma spinigerum, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Loa loa.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Helminthic infestation of the anterior segment, although rare, may present as a distinct clinical entity characterized by uveitis, secondary glaucoma, and corneal edema. Early recognition of this triad can raise clinical suspicion.

Advances in gene therapy have opened curative prospects. The objective of the current study was to provide a comprehensive bibliometric and knowledge-mapping analysis of global research on gene therapy targeting SCD, thalassemia, and hemophilia.<h4>Methods</h4>A Scopus-based bibliometric search was conducted for the period from 1986 to 2024. The search used title-specific queries for the target diseases and title-abstract queries for gene therapy technologies. Bibliometric indicators and network visualization maps, created by VOSviewer, were presented.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1399 articles were retrieved. Publication growth revealed two phases: a steady, but slow phase (1986-2018), and mature expansion phase (2019-2024), with an average annual growth rate of 28% over the last decade. The articles had a mean of 47.6 citations/article and an H-index of 126. Research was mainly distributed across medicine (39.5%), biochemistry/genetics/molecular biology (30.7%), immunology (8.1%), and pharmacology/toxicology (7.5%), reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of the field. The most prolific journal was Blood (8.6%), followed by Hemophilia, Molecular Therapy, Human Gene Therapy, and Blood Advances. The United Stated dominated the field (n = 863; 61.7%), followed by China and the United Kingdom, with the United States showing strong intra-country collaborations, while European countries demonstrated high international collaborations, often with the United States.

41186906,Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) in Predicting Stricture Formation Following Caustic Injury.,"<h4>Background</h4>Caustic ingestion remains a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and often results in long-term complications such as esophageal strictures. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is widely used for grading mucosal injury (Zargar classification) but cannot assess wall depth. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) allows visualization of transmural involvement, yet its prognostic role in caustic injuries is underexplored.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective cohort study included 63 adults with confirmed caustic ingestion who underwent both EGD and EUS within 24 h. Zargar grades and EUS findings were recorded, and patients were followed for 12 weeks to assess stricture formation and clinical outcomes. Statistical comparisons were made between those who developed strictures and those who did not.<h4>Results</h4>Median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR] 20-40), and 75% were female. Acid ingestion predominated (60%), and most cases (89%) were intentional. Strictures developed in 41% of patients, most frequently in the esophagus. Male sex was significantly associated with stricture formation (p = 0.015). All patients with Zargar grade IIIA/IIIB or muscularis/serosal involvement on EUS developed strictures, while none with Zargar I or mucosal-only involvement did. Dysphagia was the most common post-discharge symptom, reported by 40% at 12 weeks. No EUS-related complications occurred.<h4>Conclusion</h4>EUS appears promising in providing complementary prognostic information to EGD and may improve stricture risk stratification, particularly in intermediate- and high-grade injuries. Incorporating EUS into early evaluation could guide closer monitoring and intervention.

41195831,"Activatable covalent labeling probes: design, mechanism, and biological applications.","Stimuli-activatable covalent labeling probes have emerged as powerful tools for targeted biomolecule labeling, addressing the limitations of conventional covalent probes, such as off-target reactivity, limited spatiotemporal control, and low signal-to-background ratios. These probes remain inert under physiological conditions but are selectively activated by specific endogenous or exogenous stimuli-such as enzymes, reactive oxygen species, light, ultrasound, or X-ray irradiation-initiating a cascade of stimulus-activation-covalent ligation. This mechanism enables precise, on-demand covalent conjugation to target biomolecules, improving labeling specificity, enhancing probe retention at pathological sites, and reducing interference with healthy tissues. Recent advances in molecular design, including enzymatic or light-mediated proximity labeling, have expanded their applications in protein profiling, interaction mapping, cell-cell communication analysis, and <i>in vivo</i> imaging. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design principles, activation strategies focusing on enzymatic and photochemical triggers, and key biomedical applications, while critically assessing challenges related to stability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical translation.

41186090,Advances in imaging analysis of the inner ear in patients with Meniere's disease.,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Visualization of endolymphatic hydrops using MRI has become a cutting-edge method not only for diagnosing Meniere's disease but also for pathophysiological elucidation of the disease. Here, we review recent advances in imaging analysis of the inner ear in Meniere's disease, which could provide additional information over previous findings.<h4>Recent findings</h4>In addition to identification of endolymphatic hydrops on MRI, high-intensity signals in the perilymph, which represent alterations in vascular permeability in the blood-perilymph barrier (BPB), might be a key to elucidating the pathophysiology of Meniere's disease. Moreover, high-intensity signals in the endolymphatic duct, which indicate disturbances of the lymph-capillary system, might provide new information for elucidating the pathogenesis of hearing loss and dizziness/vertigo not associated with endolymphatic hydrops.<h4>Summary</h4>Presence of endolymphatic hydrops is not necessarily the cause of symptoms related to Meniere's disease. Alteration of the BLB might lead to additional disturbances in ears with Meniere's disease and induce clinical symptoms. Disturbances of the lymph-capillary system in endolymphatic duct might induce audio-vestibular symptoms in ears without endolymphatic hydrops. Further development of MRI evaluation of inner ear conditions is desirable not only for accurate diagnosis and elucidation of the pathophysiology of the diseases, but also for early medical intervention to prevent their progression.",Sone M; Yoshida T; Naganawa S,Department of Otorhinolaryngology.,Current opinion in neurology,2025-11-04,10.1097/wco.0000000000001440,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Endolymphatic hydrops; Meniere's Disease; Endolymphatic Duct; Perilymphatic Enhancement

41192245,Dynamic in vivo imaging of microplastic-induced hepatic injury via enzyme-activated far-red fluorescent probe.,"Microplastic pollution, particularly from polystyrene (PS), poses increasing risks to human health due to its persistence in the environment, tendency to bioaccumulate, and ability to induce oxidative stress and hepatic injury. However, tools for dynamic imaging that elucidate the mechanistic link between microplastic exposure and liver toxicity remain lacking. Herein, we report a far-red fluorescent probe (emission maximum at 674 nm), DDAO-CT, derived from the hydroxyl-substituted red-emitting fluorophore DDAO (9,9-dimethylacridin-2(9H)-one derivative), designed for in vivo visualization of chymotrypsin activity, a key enzyme marker known to be upregulated during microplastic-induced liver damage. DDAO-CT is constructed by conjugating a 4-bromobutyryl recognition group to the red-emissive fluorophore DDAO, which quenches fluorescence by disrupting intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Upon enzymatic hydrolysis by chymotrypsin, the ICT pathway is restored, resulting in a 14-fold enhancement in fluorescence at 674 nm with a detection limit of 3.5 ng/mL. The probe had high selectivity, low cytotoxicity, and excellent responsiveness to enzyme activity both in vitro and in PS-exposed hepatocytes. Notably, in vivo imaging in mouse models revealed dose-dependent fluorescence signals in the liver, which correlated closely with histopathological damage and elevated serum markers of liver injury. These results show that chymotrypsin activation is a downstream event of PS bioaccumulation, establishing DDAO-CT as an effective tool for visualizing pollutant-induced hepatic dysfunction. This study presents a novel chemical biology platform for noninvasive assessment of environmental hepatotoxins and offers mechanistic insights into microplastic-induced liver injury at the enzymatic level.",Zhang L; Ma M; Zhao C; Li J; Zhang S; Ma P; Zhang B; Song D,"College of Chemistry, Jilin Province Research Center for Engineering and Technology of Spectral Analytical Instruments, Jilin University, Qianjin Street 2699, Changchun, 130012, China.",Talanta,2025-11-03,10.1016/j.talanta.2025.129068,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Chymotrypsin; Microplastic Toxicity; Environmental Bioaccumulation; Far-red Probe; Liver Injury Imaging

The limbs were placed in lateral recumbency and a capped 21-gauge 1.5 inch needle was placed approximately 5 mm proximal and 32 mm caudal to the palpable distal medial radial physis into the medial aspect of the CFTS. Contrast CT was performed followed by tenoscopy using the conventional lateral approach. Gross dissection was then performed to determine if any damage was caused by needle placement. CT images were reviewed for impingement of intrathecal structures, the cephalic vein (CV) and the flexor carpi radialis tendon (FCRT).<h4>Results</h4>Neither intrathecal nor macroscopic superficial damage was caused by needle placement. Impingement of the FCRT and CV, identified on CT, occurred in seven specimens (35%) and one specimen (5%), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The location for a medial tenoscopic portal was identified in the current study.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>Establishment of the location of a medial tenoscopic portal may help surgeons improve triangulation, egress and visualization of structures within the carpal sheath.",Woods T; Dixon J; Melvaine C; Fraser B,"School of Veterinary Medicine, Murdoch University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.",Veterinary surgery : VS,2025-11-07,10.1111/vsu.70038,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41186494,Enhanced articular exposure using a lateral patellar ligament approach in Schatzker IV-C tibial plateau fractures: A cadaveric and clinical case series.,"BackgroundSchatzker IV-C tibial plateau fractures pose a significant challenge for adequate visualization and reduction of the lateral articular surface through a solitary posteromedial (PM) approach. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an adjunctive lateral patellar ligament (LPL) approach in enhancing articular exposure, assessed through cadaveric modeling and a clinical case series.MethodsIn a cadaveric study, eight preserved knee specimens were dissected using a combined PM and LPL approach. The exposed articular area was quantitatively measured using calibrated digital imaging and ImageJ software before and after the LPL approach was established. Clinically, a case series of 10 patients with Schatzker IV-C fractures underwent open reduction and internal fixation via the combined approach between October 2021 and December 2023. Outcome measures included intraoperative exposure, 12-month postoperative Knee Society Score (KSS), and complications.ResultsThe addition of the LPL approach resulted in a 96% increase in the mean exposed articular area (from 8.4 cm² to 16.5 cm²; <i>p</i> < .001) in the cadaveric specimens. All clinical fractures achieved satisfactory reduction and healing. At the 12-month follow-up, the mean KSS was 85.3 (range: 78-88), with no cases of infection, wound complications, or delayed union observed.ConclusionsThe lateral patellar ligament approach significantly improves the surgical exposure of the lateral tibial plateau in Schatzker IV-C fractures when combined with the standard posteromedial approach. This technique facilitates anatomical reduction and meniscal management, contributing to favorable short-term functional outcomes with a low complication rate. It represents a valuable auxiliary option for these complex fractures, particularly in cases involving lateral meniscal impaction or plateau widening.",Fang R; Wang K; Liu Y; Tu B; Zhang C; Ning R,"Department of Orthopedics, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (The Fifth Clinical Medical College of Anhui Medical University), Anhui, China.",Science progress,2025-11-04,10.1177/00368504251392607,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cadaveric Study; Meniscus Injury; Surgical Exposure; Tibial Plateau Fracture; Schatzker Iv-c; Lateral Patellar Ligament Approach
41188413,SAGES 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis for fluorescence image-guided gastrointestinal surgery using indocyanine green.,"<h4>Background</h4>Fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) using indocyanine green (ICG) enhances intraoperative visualization. Its application spans various surgical fields, yet evidence on its influence on clinical outcomes remains inconsistent. This systematic review was conducted as part of a guideline development process to evaluate the effectiveness of FIGS with ICG across several different surgical applications.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review was carried out, including a literature search up to October 2022, addressing eight predefined key questions (KQs) on the role FIGS with ICG in thoracic duct identification, detection of distant cancer metastases and primary cancers, lymph node retrieval, and improved evaluation of anastomotic perfusion. The search was extended until September 2024 for colorectal anastomosis application. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative observational studies. Meta-analyses were conducted where appropriate. The review is reported following PRISMA 2020 guidelines.<h4>Results</h4>Seven RCTs were pooled and found that FIGS with ICG reduced colorectal anastomotic leak rates (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.58, 95%CI 0.44-0.75). It also facilitated intraoperative changes in the transection point during colorectal anastomoses in RCTs (OR 35.15, 95%CI 8.72-141.77). FIGS with ICG increased lymph node retrieval in gastrointestinal cancer surgeries by 6.32 nodes on average (95%CI 4.43-8.22). Evidence regarding its role in thoracic duct identification, esophageal anastomoses, bariatric surgeries, and pediatric applications remained limited.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This systematic review demonstrates that FIGS with ICG improves outcomes in specific surgical applications, particularly in malignant lymph node retrieval and colorectal anastomotic leak reduction. However, its effectiveness varies depending on the surgical context and clinical question. Further high-quality studies are required to address remaining gaps and inform evidence-based guidelines for broader implementation.",Kapsampelis P; Calabrese EC; Kumar SS; Shehata D; Bansal V; Carsky K; Eason A; Khataniar H; Scholz S; Rodríguez-Luna MR; Narula N; Chiu J; Ayloo S; Husain F; Abou-Setta A; Awad Z; Slater BJ; Keller DS,"Leeds Institute of Emergency General Surgery, St James's University Hospital, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, UK.",Surgical endoscopy,2025-11-04,10.1007/s00464-025-12355-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Meta-analysis; Surgery; Systematic review; Indocyanine Green (Icg); Fluorescence Image-guided Surgery (Figs)
41184458,Flexible Percutaneous Laser Lithotripsy for Intrahepatic Stones: A Multicenter Study in Western Patients.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Intrahepatic lithiasis (IHL) remains a challenging condition in populations, particularly in patients with surgically altered biliary anatomy or failed endoscopic interventions. Percutaneous laser lithotripsy (PLL) under flexible cholangioscopic guidance has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative for managing complex intrahepatic stones.<h4>Purpose</h4>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of flexible PLL for the treatment of intrahepatic stones in a multicenter Brazilian cohort with altered anatomy or failed ERCP.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The primary outcome was technical success, defined as complete ductal clearance confirmed by cholangioscopy or MRI at 1-month follow-up. Clinical success was defined as resolution of biliary symptoms without recurrence or need for additional intervention during follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the number of lithotripsy sessions, complication rates, and symptomatic stone recurrence.<h4>Results</h4>Complete ductal clearance was achieved in 100% of patients, with a mean of 1.29 lithotripsy sessions per patient. Minor complications occurred in 11.4% of cases, with no major adverse events, bile duct injuries, or procedure-related deaths. No symptomatic recurrence was observed during a mean follow-up of 14.7 months. Notably, five incidental biliary polyps were identified under direct cholangioscopic visualization; one was confirmed as low-grade dysplasia. These lesions were not detected on preprocedural imaging, highlighting the added diagnostic value of cholangioscopy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Flexible PLL is a safe, effective, and reproducible technique for managing complex intrahepatic lithiasis, especially in patients with altered anatomy or failed endoscopic treatment. The added diagnostic yield and potential for outpatient protocols using disposable cholangioscopes support broader adoption of this approach in interventional radiology.",Nunes TF; Batista LL; Salas H; de Brito Siqueira LT; de Oliveira Leite TF; Reyes IS; de Melo RAB; Stefanini FS; de Lacerda Barbosa D; Ziemnick E; Sjzenfeld D; Gonçalves B,"Interventix, Rua Dr. Antônio Alves Arantes, 398, Chácara Cachoeira, Campo Grande, MS, 79040-720, Brazil. thiagofranchinunes@gmail.com.",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,2025-11-03,10.1007/s00270-025-04248-8,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),interventional radiology; Intrahepatic Lithiasis; Biliary Stone Management; Flexible Cholangioscopy; Percutaneous Laser Lithotripsy
41187606,Innovative Learning in Anatomy Education: Assessing the Impact of Low-Cost 3D Deep Learning Anatomical Models in Museum-Based Instruction.,"<h4>Background</h4>Anatomy education traditionally relies on cadaveric dissection and static models, which can be costly, ethically complex, and limited in interactivity, hindering students' ability to grasp clinical correlations and spatial relationships. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a virtual anatomy museum approach, leveraging low-cost, interactive 3D models and deep learning, to enhance clinical reasoning and anatomical understanding among medical undergraduate students.<h4>Methodology</h4>In this non-experimental, observational study, designed as a proof of concept, 40 undergraduate students from the Bachelor of Applied Medical Sciences program at King Khalid University are divided into Target (n = 20) and Control (n = 20) groups based on pre-assigned enrolment numbers. The Target Group engages with a web-based virtual anatomy museum platform featuring interactive 3D anatomical models (e.g., brain, spine, knee) in a museum-like environment over a 15-week semester, fostering exploration and clinical understanding. The platform, powered by a PointNeXt deep learning backbone and AnatoVision Block, provided interactive visualization, annotations, and quizzes. The platform provides interactive features, such as rotating models to examine structures like the cerebellum for neurological assessments or the femur for fracture diagnosis, along with clear labels and quizzes. The Control Group receives traditional lecture-based instruction supplemented with 3D-printed anatomical models, serving as a baseline to contextualize the Target Group's experience rather than a direct comparator, given the qualitative differences between interactive digital and lecture-based approaches with physical models. Post-intervention, students' clinical reasoning and anatomical proficiency are assessed using case-based questionnaires targeting 5 dimensions: acceptance, clinical problem-solving creativity, motivation, knowledge gain, and communication skills. Students also rate their experience via a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, providing insights into the platform's potential to enhance anatomy education in resource-limited settings.<h4>Results</h4>The Target Group scored significantly higher (mean 4.48 ± 0.66) than the Control Group (mean 3.45 ± 0.70) in overall performance (p < 0.01). Notable improvements were observed in anatomical understanding (95% vs. 65%, p = 0.01), clinical scenario interpretation (90% vs. 70%, p = 0.02), and motivation (85% vs. 50%, p = 0.05). Most Target Group students (92%, n = 18) agreed that the virtual 3D models enhanced clinical relevance, spatial orientation, and interdisciplinary communication, with 100% recommending its curriculum integration. Technical difficulties were reported by 25% of the Target Group (p = 0.49).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The virtual anatomy museum approach, utilizing low-cost, interactive 3D models, demonstrates strong potential to enhance clinical reasoning and anatomical proficiency among medical students at King Khalid University. The platform, explored as a proof of concept, fosters skills critical for clinical practice, such as identifying cranial sutures for neuroimaging or planning surgical corridors for hip replacements, offering a scalable, engaging supplement to medical education in resource-limited settings. The Target Group's experience, contextualized against a Control Group receiving lecture-based instruction with 3D-printed models, highlights the platform's ability to support hands-on learning.",Sharma B; Alhazmi A; Nasir N; Bridget B,"College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Khalid University, Saudi Arabia.

41183363,Contrast-Enhanced Mammography: Does Image Acquisition Time and Projection Order Matter?,"<h4>Objective</h4>To determine reader preference for image order and thus, by inference, image timing after contrast administration that maximizes cancer visualization on contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM).<h4>Methods</h4>This IRB-approved reader study includes consecutive CEMs performed for research or clinical care in patients before a diagnosis of unifocal breast cancer, where the cancer was seen on both craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) recombined images. All CEMs started with the side containing cancer and alternated with the nonaffected side of the same projection. From 2016 to 2018, CC projection was performed first (group 1), and from 2019 to 2020, the MLO projection was performed first (group 2). Five readers evaluated cases for background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) and lesion type. Readers assessed cancer visibility, confidence in margins, and cancer conspicuity using a 5-point Likert scale. Contrast-to-noise (CNR) measurements were also taken.<h4>Results</h4>Seventy-eight female patients were included. Group 1 (CC-first) included 40 patients (51%) and group 2 (MLO-first) included 38 patients (49%). Mean age differed between groups by 5 years (P = .031), otherwise there were no differences in group characteristics. There was an overall preference for earlier-obtained images for cancer visibility, confidence in margins, and lesion conspicuity against BPE (P < .001) and preference for CC projection for lesion conspicuity (P = .045). In 35 instances (35/390, 9%), an individual reader reported a different lesion type on images obtained later, with a majority (28/35, 80%) reporting a less discernible lesion on later-obtained imaging (eg, mass changed to nonmass enhancement).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study shows significant reader preference for cancer characteristic evaluation of CEM performed at earlier time points.",Dwan D; Konstantopoulos C; Mehta TS; Brook A; Dialani V; Fein-Zachary VJ; Karimova EJ; Lotfi P; Mehta RJ; Phillips J,"Department of Radiology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.",Journal of breast imaging,2025-11-03,10.1093/jbi/wbaf033,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Breast Cancer Risk Assessment; Contrast-enhanced Mammography; Breast Imaging Clinical Operations; Breast Imaging Quality And Outcomes
40360182,Reporting the Degree of Certainty of CSF-Venous Fistulas in Patients with Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension: The Duke CSF-Venous Fistula Confidence Score.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs) are a common cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). CVF identification and localization are critical for diagnosis and treatment, but inconsistent visualization of CVFs on myelography leads to diagnostic uncertainty. Diagnostic confidence impacts treatment decisions. However, there is currently no standardized method for reporting the degree of confidence about the presence or absence of a CVF on CT myelography (CTM). The purposes of this study are to present a novel instrument to provide structured communication of the degree of certainty about the presence of a CVF and to determine the interreader and intrareader agreement of this scoring system for determining the presence of a CVF at a given spinal level on CTMs.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective study assessed the interreader and intrareader reproducibility of a scoring system anchored in previously reported objective imaging findings, including the attenuation of paraspinal veins associated with CVFs. We included CTMs from patients with SIH performed between 10/2017-03/2024 at 1 institution. Exclusion criteria were CSF leak other than CVF, prior transvenous embolization, and nondiagnostic CTMs. Several potential iterations of the scoring system were developed. The study cohort consisted of a balanced set of cases representative of varying degrees of certainty: definite, high probability, low probability, and negative (25 each). Five radiologists (3-19 years of experience) provided their blinded subjective confidence assessment and then applied the scoring system. Interreader and intrareader agreements were calculated for the different scoring system models using kappa statistics.<h4>Results</h4>The best-performing model produced substantial mean intrareader agreement, closely approximated the number of definite CVFs, and was adopted as the final model. Interreader agreement for the adopted model was moderate, replicating that for the subjective interpretations. Other versions of the model produced fair-to-moderate interreader agreements and were not adopted.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a structured reporting system anchored in objective imaging findings that communicates the degree of certainty about the presence of CVF on CTM. This system replicates assessments by expert readers and meets a critical need for improved communication both in daily clinical practice and in research by providing a method for objectively quantifying the certainty of CVF diagnosis.",Amrhein TJ; Zhu D; Gray L; Kilpatrick KW; Erkanli A; Willhite J; Malinzak MD; Kranz PG,"From the Department of Radiology (T.J.A., L.G., J.W., M.D.M., P.G.K.), Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina timothy.amrhein@duke.edu.",AJNR.

41201632,Patterns of Recurrence and Oncologic Outcomes After Maxillectomy: Does Reconstructive Modality Matter?,"<h4>Background</h4>Reconstruction following maxillectomy for oral cavity malignancies is essential for restoring form and function. Obturator reconstruction facilitates direct visualization of the surgical bed, whereas flap-based reconstructions may obscure sites of potential recurrence. This has raised concern that reconstructive modality could influence the timeliness of recurrence detection, and subsequently, oncologic outcomes.<h4>Purpose</h4>The purpose of this study was to measure the association between reconstructive modality and time to detection of local recurrence and survival outcomes.<h4>Study design, setting sample</h4>This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing maxillectomy for an oral cavity malignancy at the University of Maryland between 2016 and 2024. Patients previously undergoing maxillectomy were excluded.<h4>Predictor variable</h4>The predictor was reconstructive modality: obturator versus native tissue reconstruction (local, regional, or free flap).<h4>Main outcome variable</h4>The primary outcome was local disease-free survival. Secondary outcomes included overall survival, method of recurrence detection (clinical vs radiographic), and resectability of recurrence.<h4>Covariates</h4>Covariates were categorized into demographic (age, sex), perioperative (Brown classification), and pathologic (margin status, tumor stage).<h4>Analyses</h4>Descriptive statistics were computed for study variables. Associations between study covariates and time to local recurrence were evaluated using bivariate Cox proportional hazards models.<h4>Results</h4>The cohort was composed of 154 subjects with a mean age of 66.5 ± 14.9 years and 90 were male (58.4%). Fifty subjects (32.5%) underwent obturator reconstruction and 104 (67.5%) underwent reconstruction with native tissue (75% free flap). Reconstructive modality was not associated with local disease-free survival (P = .9), method of detection (P = .4), or overall survival (P = .3). Local recurrence occurred in 41 subjects (26.6%), with 14 (34.1%) in the obturator group compared to 27 (65.9%) in native tissue (P = .7). The median time to local recurrence was 7.7 months (interquartile range 26.2 months). Most recurrences (75.6%) were detected clinically. Subgroup analysis of Brown 2 defects confirmed the similar findings.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Reconstructive modality was not associated with delayed detection of local recurrence or worse survival outcomes following maxillectomy for oral cavity malignancies.",Lee C; Wasay SA; Jenkins G; Moyer K; Hatten K; Wolf JS; Taylor R; Lubek J; Dyalram D,"Assistant Professor, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD.

41199365,Does ginsenoside Rg1 promote intervertebral disc repair? An experimental study insights into ferroptosis mechanism.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a complex and multifactorial condition characterized by the progressive deterioration of the intervertebral discs. Ginsenoside Rg1, a bioactive compound isolated from Panax ginseng C.A.Mey., that has demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in the treatment of IVDD.<h4>Methods</h4>This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate the therapeutic effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on IVDD. Initially, histopathology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in clinical IVDD patients. Subsequently, histopathology, safranin green staining, X-ray, and MRI were utilized to evaluate the efficacy of ginsenoside Rg1 in alleviating in a rat model in vivo. Transcriptomics and gene set enrichment analysis (GESA) were conducted, and a network pharmacology visualization of ginsenoside Rg1-ferroptosis key targets-pathways-IVDD was constructed, along with molecular docking of ginsenoside Rg1 and targets, to identify the signaling pathways and proteins associated with the therapeutic effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on alleviating IVDD. Additionally, an Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced degeneration model of nucleus pulposus cells (NP cells) was used to evaluate the efficacy of ginsenoside Rg1 in alleviating IVDD in vitro. Methods including lipid-reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), FerroOrange staining, and transmission electron microscopy were employed to validate the effect and mechanism of ginsenoside Rg1 on alleviating IVDD in vivo and in vitro. ML385, a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) inhibitor, was used to reverse the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 in mitophagy and ferroptosis, respectively. The expression of proteins was assessed on immunochemical, immunofluorescence, and western blotting techniques.<h4>Results</h4>Significant ferroptosis was observed in the NP tissue of IVDD patients, with more effects in patients with higher imaging grades. Ginsenoside Rg1 significantly mitigated IVDD in rats and promoted intervertebral disc repair. Network pharmacology and transcriptomics analyses indicated the key targets of ginsenoside Rg1 for the treatment of IVDD, including NRF2, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), solute carrier family 7a member 11 (SLC7A11), and ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1). Molecular docking exhibited that ginsenoside Rg1 had good binding ability between ginsenoside Rg1 and these ferroptosis key targets. Ginsenoside Rg1 reduced the expression of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA), decreased Fe<sup>2+</sup> content, increased the expression of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and upregulated the expression of ferroptosis key proteins NRF2, GPX4, FTL1, and SLC7A11 in intervertebral disc tissues and NP cells. Treatment with ML385 attenuated the ginsenoside Rg1-induced upregulation of these proteins in NP cells, thereby promoting ferroptosis and reversing the protective effects of ginsenoside Rg1.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ginsenoside Rg1 can mitigate IVDD by inhibiting ferroptosis in NP cells. The NRF2/GPX4 pathway was validated as the key ferroptosis pathway through which ginsenoside Rg1 exerts its therapeutic effects on IVDD.",Gong D; Xia F; Wang F; Tong X; Yang Q; Shen K; Sun B; Chen N; Lu Z,"Department of Orthopedics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, No. 1055 Sanxiang Road, Suzhou, 215004, China.",Journal of translational medicine,2025-11-06,10.1186/s12967-025-07047-4,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Ginsenoside Rg1; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Transcriptomics; Network Pharmacology; Ferroptosis; Nrf2/gpx4 Pathway
41191036,"Epidemiological trends and burden of nutritional deficiencies among infants in India: Evidences from the Global Burden of Disease study, 1990-2021.","BackgroundNutritional deficiencies among infants continue to be a significant contributor to the disease burden in India.AimTherefore, this study analyses the annual trends and overall burden of nutritional deficiencies among infants and forecasts the prevalence in India.MethodsData were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study to analyse temporal trends in nutritional deficiencies among infants in India from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to assess changes over time, while the ARIMA model was used for forecasting. Subnational-level Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) performance data were retrieved from the National Institute for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog dashboard to understand the association between nutritional deficiencies and SDGs, presented through a heat map created using MS Excel.SummaryBetween 1990 and 2021, the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies among infants in India declined from 798.69 (95% UI: 765.85 to 830.22) to 683.54 (95% UI: 664.02 to 702.93) per 1000 live births, with an annual percentage change of -14.42. Despite this overall improvement, substantial interstate disparities persist. In 2021, Bihar [763.04 (95% UI: 723.24 to 799.46)], Jharkhand [756.8 (95% UI: 729.3 to 787.24)], and Uttar Pradesh [726.57 (95% UI: 697.24 to 758.62)] recorded the highest prevalence, while Mizoram [408.87 (95% UI: 367.44 to 455.12)] reported the lowest. Despite a measurable decline in the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies among infants in India from 1990 to 2021, the condition remains a major public health concern. The persistence of significant regional disparities, particularly in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, reflects underlying systemic inequities in healthcare access and nutrition delivery. The observed association between subnational SDGs performance and nutritional outcomes underlines the need to enhance primary healthcare services and strengthen nutritional support systems, especially in lagging regions.",Roy C; Kalbalia P,"Department of Geography and Resource Management, Mizoram University, Aizawl, India.",Nutrition and health,2025-11-05,10.1177/02601060251392283,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Children; India; Global Burden Of Disease; Nutritional Deficiencies; Arima; Sustainable Development Goals
41204714,"Funding Distributions, Trends, Gaps, and Policy Implications for Spinal Cord Injury Research: A Systematic Analysis of U.S. Federal Funds.","Federal agencies including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Defense (DoD) Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) Spinal Cord Injury Research Program (SCIRP), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provide the majority of funding for spinal cord injury (SCI) research in the United States. However, systematic evaluation of how funding is distributed across research areas, therapeutic approaches, and translational stages has been limited. To understand the distribution of funds, we curated and classified 1,589 federally funded SCI research awards from the NIH (2008-2023), the CDMRP SCIRP (2009-2023), and the VA (2017-2025). Each award was annotated based on the biological system or problem studied, the therapeutic intervention or approach utilized, and its placement along the translational continuum. Our analysis revealed that the NIH predominantly supports basic and early-stage translational research, especially in areas of SCI pathology, regeneration, and motor functional recovery. In contrast, the CDMRP funding is more concentrated on applied and clinical research, particularly in the areas of pain, bladder function, and neuromodulatory device development. The VA predominantly invests in rehabilitation-focused studies and interventions aimed at improving musculoskeletal and functional health outcomes. While the complementary missions of these agencies collectively support a diverse SCI research ecosystem, we identified critical gaps in funding for high-priority areas such as bowel/gastrointestinal health, cardiovascular function, and mental health. Furthermore, the recent discontinuation of the CDMRP SCIRP and proposed NIH budget reductions are projected to lead to an approximate 50% decline in federal SCI research funding by 2026-posing a substantial risk to the field's progress and threatening the stability of this ecosystem. These findings underscore the urgent need for coordinated, data-driven funding strategies that align more closely with the needs and priorities of the SCI community. To that end, we propose the development of a publicly accessible ""living dashboard"" to enhance transparency, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and guide strategic investment in SCI research moving forward.",Gillespie T; Buxton A; Kondiles BR; Leal-Garcia M; Pacheco MR; Tran AV; Vo K; Abu L; Barr J; Barretto TA; Biundo J; Duenwald S; Evans A; Friedman TN; Gadaleta I; Ganesh S; Gottschall B; Green P; Lee G; Liu L; Malik RN; Nava EJ; Sorani C; Tandon V; Thomas H; Thomas K; Barr C; Burkhart I; McCreedy DA; Nowell P; Blackmon H; Rabchevsky AG; Rodreick M; Torres-Espín A; Dulin JN,"Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, Texas, USA.",Journal of neurotrauma,2025-11-05,10.1177/08977151251392895,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Spinal cord injury; Systematic analysis; Va; Nih; Research Funding; Federal Funding; Dod; Cdmrp
41183372,Community-Based Organizations' Approaches to Recruitment and Retention for a Digital HIV Prevention Intervention for Young Men Who Have Sex With Men: A Mixed Methods Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Digital health interventions (DHIs) can broaden the reach of HIV prevention interventions and overcome barriers for young cisgender men who have sex with men (YMSM). Community-based organizations (CBOs) have delivered HIV prevention interventions for decades, but few studies have examined how CBOs implement DHIs, including recruitment and retention. Keep It Up! (KIU!) is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-designated best-evidence DHI that can promote risk reduction behaviors and reduce sexually transmitted infection incidence.<h4>Objective</h4>We sought to descriptively assess CBOs' approaches to recruitment and retention, elucidate lessons learned, and provide examples of recruitment and retention for future implementers.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-two CBOs in counties with high HIV rates and large proportions of YMSM were selected through a request for proposal process to implement KIU!. Data were extracted from request for proposal applications and notes from monthly calls with CBO staff. Twenty-five staff members across CBOs were interviewed in the middle of implementation. A descriptive thematic analysis of the lessons learned in recruiting and retaining participants was performed. The research team developed an application dashboard for CBO staff to register participants, track participant progress through the intervention, record and track participant contact, and export usage data. CBO logins to the KIU! dashboard were tracked across the implementation. To descriptively compare approaches to recruitment and retention, the study team divided CBOs according to annual HIV testing volume in the 3 years prior to implementation and years of HIV service provision to YMSM.<h4>Results</h4>The most frequent modes of recruitment were outreach and community partnerships (21/22, 95%), and the least frequent modes were via hook-up apps (6/22, 27%) and participant referrals (5/22, 23%). CBOs with a low HIV testing volume used online recruitment slightly more frequently, while medium-volume CBOs most frequently used hook-up apps for recruitment. Low-volume CBOs more frequently used phone calls and emails to remind participants to complete intervention modules, while high- and medium-volume CBOs more frequently used text messages. CBOs with more years of HIV service provision to YMSM more frequently had a set reminder schedule for contact with participants. CBO staff identified a need to change how KIU! is pitched to clients by using personalized, recipient-centered language rather than technical jargon. CBOs changed intake forms to ensure that staff remembered to offer KIU! to participants. CBOs had a difficult time retaining participants despite holding in-person events for enrolled participants (eg, raffles and trivia nights) and altering the frequency with which they reminded participants to complete modules.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although CBOs had experience in implementing other evidence-based interventions with YMSM, there was no consensus on successful recruitment and retention strategies for this population.

41188889,From zero-COVID to global alignment: transnational pressures and China's pandemic communication transformation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Public health crises are governed not only through policies but also through talk. Government press conferences are ritualized arenas where authorities construct meaning, claim competence, and manage domestic and international legitimacy. China's abrupt transition from ""zero‑COVID"" to a strategy of coexistence provides a critical case for examining how transnational pressures-from the World Health Organization, diplomatic partners, markets, and global media-shape official communication over time.<h4>Main body</h4>This study analyzes 154 central government press‑conference transcripts (February 2020-February 2023) using a mixed‑methods design that combines topic modeling with qualitative frame analysis and process tracing of international pressure events. We segment the period into four phases-International Scrutiny, Global Cooperation, International Isolation, and Global Alignment-and identify seven recurring frames spanning health‑system capacity, epidemiological standards, vaccine diplomacy, economic-health trade‑offs, supply‑chain interdependence, and policy adaptation. Event‑timing analysis shows a consistent lag of roughly 7-21 days between major international cues and subsequent adjustments in domestic frames, with the economic-health and policy‑adaptation frames most responsive. A micro‑level discourse analysis demonstrates ""semantic governance"": lexical substitutions (""optimization,"" ""new phase"") and contextual recoding that converted a substantive policy reversal into a narrative of adaptive improvement. We argue that authorities achieved discursive alignment with evolving global norms without immediate policy convergence, illustrating how sovereignty sensitivities are managed communicatively. The findings also reveal equity‑relevant mechanisms: semantic smoothing that stabilizes compliance can under‑specify risks for vulnerable groups during transition windows, and generic references to ""key populations"" can displace time‑bound commitments to protection and access. Building on these insights, we propose two practical tools for global health governance: (1) an equity checkpoint for each policy pivot (plain‑language risk summaries, service guarantees, and a short equity note), and (2) a discursive alignment dashboard that tracks lead-lag to international guidance, domain‑specific alignment, and semantic markers of convergence or divergence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Pandemic communication in China followed a cyclical frame‑reinforcement pattern rather than a linear arc, and relied on semantic governance to manage rapid policy change under transnational pressure. Recognizing and monitoring these communicative mechanisms can strengthen global health governance and reduce equity risks during future protracted emergencies.",Liu D; Mustafa SEB; Sarmiti NZB,"Department of Media and Communication Studies, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Malaya, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, 50603, Malaysia.",Globalization and health,2025-11-04,10.1186/s12992-025-01155-y,1.5,dashboard(abstract),Frame Analysis; Crisis Communication; Government Communication; Covid-19; Semantic Governance
