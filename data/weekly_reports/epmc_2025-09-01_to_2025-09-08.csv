40900239,Systematic reviews of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs): table templates for effective communication.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) are an important tool to guide the selection of OMIs for research and clinical practice. However, presenting the large amount of complex data pertaining both to the quality of each study (i.e., risk of bias) as well as the quality of the instrument (i.e., measurement properties), along with the underpinning certainty of evidence, is challenging. Here, we aim to provide guidance on optimizing data presentation in OMI systematic reviews, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).<h4>Methods</h4>A multidisciplinary team of experts in OMI systematic reviews, research reporting, and data visualization built on existing table templates from OMERACT and the COSMIN initiative, to align with reporting items in a recently developed reporting guideline for systematic reviews of OMIs: PRISMA-COSMIN for OMIs 2024. To enhance clarity and usability, we applied data visualization principles by reducing non-essential elements and improving interpretability through structured layouts and concise explanatory text.<h4>Results</h4>We present eight templates for reporting PROM systematic review results: three pertain to PROM characteristics, two to studies' characteristics, two to the evaluation of measurement properties, and one to the summary of findings. We also provide recommendations on whether to include these templates in the review's main manuscript or in the supplementary materials. Word versions of these templates can be downloaded from www.prisma-cosmin.ca and www.cosmin.nl .<h4>Conclusion</h4>Templates complementing the PRISMA-COSMIN for OMIs 2024 reporting guidance can be used to standardize and enhance the clarity and usefulness of OMI systematic reviews focusing on PROMs. They comprise a comprehensive set of tools to effectively report OMI systematic reviews, in service of end-users who are selecting OMIs.",Elsman EBM; Boers M; Terwee CB; Beaton D; Abma I; Aiyegbusi OL; Chiarotto A; Haywood K; Matvienko-Sikar K; Mehdipour A; Oosterveer DM; Mokkink LB; Offringa M,"Department of Epidemiology and Data Science, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. e.elsman@amsterdamumc.nl.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2025-09-03,10.1007/s11136-025-04058-y,9.0,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Systematic Reviews; Data Visualization; Measurement Properties; Omeract; Cosmin; Patient-reported Outcome Measures (Proms)
40913664,"A roadmap of artificial intelligence applications in pediatric surgery: a comprehensive review of applications, challenges, and ethical considerations.","Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming healthcare, with growing interest in their application to rare pediatric surgical conditions. In these settings, limited data availability often brakes traditional research. Although pediatric surgery has historically been slower than other specialties in adopting ML, recent years have seen an increase in AI-driven tools designed for surgical care. This review presents an overview of AI applications in pediatric surgery, highlighting current uses, benefits, challenges, and their potential clinical impact. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies on AI and ML models relevant to pediatric surgery. The findings indicate that ML is mainly applied in predictive decision support, particularly for preoperative risk stratification, intraoperative navigation, and postoperative outcome prediction. AI is especially valuable in endoscopic and minimally invasive procedures, where it enhances the visualization of anatomical landmarks. In pediatric oncologic surgery, AI aids in the accurate localization and delineation of tumors. Additionally, AI improves pathology workflows through automated image analysis and annotation, supporting both diagnosis and education. Despite these advances, ethical and regulatory challenges remain. Ensuring data privacy and obtaining informed consent are essential. When responsibly implemented, AI can significantly improve pediatric surgical care.",Duci M; Bossi A; Uccheddu F; Fascetti-Leon F,"Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padua, Italy. ducimiriam@gmail.com.",Pediatric surgery international,2025-09-06,10.1007/s00383-025-06185-6,8.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(title,abstract); machine learning(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Computer vision; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Pediatric Surgery; Aritficial Intelligence
40908019,Action design research to develop an interactive dashboard to visualise and compare patient data from Irish general practice (CARA).,"<h4>Objective</h4>A dashboard was developed with and for Irish general practitioners (GPs) to improve their understanding of practice data. The aim of this study was to design and develop interactive CARA dashboards to enable Irish GPs to visualise patient data and compare their data with other practices.<h4>Design</h4>An interpretivist qualitative approach was taken to create a deeper understanding of how GPs view and engage with data. It included four stages: (a) problem formulation, (b) building, intervention and evaluation, (c) reflection and learning and (d) formalisation of learning. The process included interviews to explore what type of information GPs need, as well as iterative testing of the CARA dashboard prototype.<h4>Setting</h4>General practice.<h4>Participants</h4>GPs, design experts and domain experts (antibiotic prescribing and stewardship).<h4>Results</h4>Key challenges identified from the interviews (context, sense-making, audits, relevance, action, engagement and ease of use) formed the basis for developing the CARA dashboard prototype. The first exemplar dashboard focused on antibiotic prescribing to develop and showcase the proposed platform, including automated audit reports, filters (within-practice) and between-practice comparisons, as well as a visual overview of practice demographics. The design thinking approach helped to capture and build an understanding of the GPs' perspectives and identify unmet needs. This approach benefits the quality improvement methodology commonly adopted across healthcare, which aims to understand the process, not the users.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The development of a <i>useful</i> dashboard is based on two key elements: users' requirements and their continued involvement in the development of content and overall design decisions. The next step will be an incremental inclusion of GPs using the dashboard and an exploratory study on dashboard engagement.

40912308,Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4)-targeting fluorescent probes for precision intraoperative visualization of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aims to develop and validate a novel ACSL4-targeted fluorescent probe to enhance intraoperative visualization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), emphasizing its binding affinity, specificity, and clinical applicability.<h4>Methods</h4>Transcriptomic sequencing data from TCGA, ICGC, CPTAC, and GSE25097 were analyzed to establish ACSL4 as a viable target for tumor visualization. An ACSL4-specific binding peptide (ABP) was identified using a combination of in vivo and in vitro phage display screening. The peptide was conjugated with IRDye 800CW to create a fluorescent probe (ABP-IRDye 800CW). Binding specificity was assessed using fluorescence imaging and immunoprecipitation assays. Biosafety was evaluated through primary organ histology and blood biochemistry following probe administration.<h4>Results</h4>Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated that ABP exhibited moderate binding affinity to ACSL4 (Kd = 3.767 μM). The probe selectively targeted HCC cells with high ACSL4 expression while sparing normal tissues. In vivo imaging showed the most potent tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) of 4.58 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, correlating with ACSL4 expression.

40892141,Proposal of a new visual analogue scale to describe the extent of lymphadenectomy in right-sided colectomy for cancer-a prospective observational study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lymphadenectomy in right-sided colon cancer lacks standardized reporting. The aim was to develop a visual analogue scale (VAS) based on mesenteric vessels to describe the extent of lymphadenectomy.<h4>Methods</h4>We included patients undergoing surgery for right-sided colon cancer from January 2021 to September 2024. Data were collected via a web-based database. Immediately after surgery, surgeons recorded the VAS score, vascular visualization, and specimen quality.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 155 patients were analyzed. Median age was 74 (IQR: 68-80), with 53% female. The median VAS score was 8.2 (IQR: 7.8-8.9). The superior mesenteric vein (SMV) was visualized in 84% of cases, with a median VAS score of 8.4 (IQR: 8.0-9.2) for visualized and 7.0 (IQR: 6.8-7.5) for non-visualized (p < 0.001). The gastrocolic trunk of Henle (GTH) was visualized in 51%, with a median VAS score of 8.7 (IQR: 8.3-9.7) for visualized and 7.9 (IQR: 7.3-8.0) for non-visualized (p < 0.001). Specimen quality was Type 0 (best) in 54% (VAS score 8.6, IQR: 8.2-9.5), Type I in 37% (VAS score 7.9, IQR: 7.3-8.0), and Type II in 6% (VAS score 6.9, IQR: 6.5-7.9; p < 0.001). A positive correlation between VAS score and lymph node count was found (r = 0.43, p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The VAS score is a reliable and feasible method to describe lymphadenectomy in right-sided colon cancer. Unlike categorical classifications, the VAS score is based on anatomical landmarks and does not depend on consensus definitions. It reflects the visualization of vascular structures and correlates with specimen quality and lymph node yield.<h4>Clinical trial</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT06329102 (registered on March 24, 2024).<h4>Article type</h4>Prospective observational study.",Pfeffer F; Kalgraff P; Lygre KB; Nedrebø BS; Forsmo HM,"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021, Bergen, Norway. frank.pfeffer@uib.no.",Techniques in coloproctology,2025-09-02,10.1007/s10151-025-03182-8,6.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Lymphadenectomy; Visual Analogue Scale; Surgical Quality Assessment; Right-sided Colon Cancer; Mesenteric Lymph Node Dissection; Specimen Evaluation

40912472,The Clinical Utility of Real-Time Patient Reported Outcomes in Cell Therapy Recipients.,"<h4>Background</h4>The use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can improve a patient's clinical course by decreasing the incidence and severity of both physical and emotional treatment-related toxicities, uncover unmet patient needs and assist in patients' shared decision-making.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility and utility of using electronically captured ""real time"" agenda-setting questions and PROMs at the time of the patient's clinic visit.<h4>Study design</h4>We designed a prospective observational study that employed a pre-visit questionnaire (PVQ) that included agenda-setting questions and the PROMIS-29 survey, with results incorporated into a clinical decision support dashboard embedded within the patients' electronic medical record (EMR). The real-time results within the dashboard were used during each patient's clinic visit to encourage and support conversations between patients and their transplant clinician.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred and thirty-seven consecutive cellular therapy recipients (allogeneic stem cell transplant, n=98; autologous transplant, n=106; or CAR-T cell, n=33) seen between April 2022 and January 2025 were included. Over the study period, PVQ completion rates reached 80%, with an average of 60% weekly. The majority of patients (82%; n=162) reported that the information in the dashboard helped them talk to their clinician about what mattered most and 78% of patients (n=154) noted that the dashboard helped them make healthcare decisions. Each of the transplant clinicians (n=9) believed that the information gathered from the PVQ was helpful by aiding their discussions with the patient during the clinic visit. When using an internationally recognized and verified process to assess shared decision-making (CollaboRATE), 91% of patients (n=180) believed that the dashboard assisted them in making future medical decisions. Eighty-nine percent of transplant clinicians agreed that the use of the PVQ aided patients in shared decision-making.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of real-time PROMs and agenda setting questions embedded within an electronic dashboard for cellular therapy patients.

40890461,Decoding and spatial mapping of acoustic noise in the neonatal intensive care unit.,"The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a critical care setting where premature infants face continuous exposure to elevated noise levels, often exceeding international safety guidelines. While the risks of excessive acoustic exposure are well established, strategies for real-time noise monitoring and mitigation in operational NICUs remain underexplored. In this study, we propose an exploratory framework that integrates spatially distributed sound sensors, acoustic heatmap visualization, and machine learning-based classification to analyze and categorize noise events in a high-density NICU setting. The analysis identified persistent high-noise zones near incubators and entryways, with staff movement and alarm-related activities causing significant sound level spikes-particularly during the noon shift. Additionally, a random forest classifier achieved 85.5% accuracy in distinguishing clinical activity patterns based on environmental acoustic data.

40903179,Real-Time Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging for Monitoring Tumor Response During Intensive Care Management of Oncologic Emergencies.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Oncologic emergencies in critically ill cancer patients frequently require rapid, real-time assessment of tumor responses to therapeutic interventions. However, conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are often impractical in intensive care units (ICUs) due to logistical constraints and patient instability. Super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) imaging has emerged as a promising noninvasive alternative, facilitating bedside evaluation of tumor microvascular dynamics with exceptional spatial resolution. This study assessed the clinical utility of real-time SR-US imaging in monitoring tumor perfusion changes during emergency management in oncological ICU settings. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> In this prospective observational study, critically ill patients with oncologic emergencies underwent bedside SR-US imaging before and after the initiation of emergency therapy (e.g., corticosteroids, decompression, or chemotherapy). SR-US was employed to quantify microvascular parameters, including perfusion density and flow heterogeneity. Data processing incorporated artificial intelligence for real-time vessel segmentation and quantitative analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> SR-US imaging successfully detected perfusion changes within hours of therapy initiation. A significant correlation was observed between reduced tumor perfusion and clinical improvement, including symptom relief and shorter ICU stay. This technology enables visualization of microvessels as small as 30 µm, surpassing conventional ultrasound limits. No adverse events were reported with the use of contrast microbubbles. In addition, SR-US imaging reduces the need for transportation to radiology departments, thereby optimizing ICU workflow. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Real-time SR-US imaging offers a novel, bedside-compatible method for evaluating tumor vascular response during the acute phase of oncological emergencies. Its integration into ICU care pathways could enhance timely decision-making, reduce reliance on static imaging, and support personalized cancer management. Further multicenter validation is required.",Wu J; Xu W; Li L; Xie W; Tang B,"Department of Critical Care Medicine, The First People's Hospital of Jiande, Hangzhou city, China.",Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,2025-09-04,10.1177/10849785251376112,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); data(abstract),microvasculature; Intensive Care; Real-time Imaging; Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound; Oncologic Emergency; Bedside Ultrasound; Tumor Perfusion; Super-resolution Ultrasound; Ai-assisted Imaging; Cancer Critical Care

40907053,MOSAIC: A Multi-Granularity Cross-Modal Framework for Predicting Synergistic Drug Combinations in Personalized Healthcare.,"The personalization of cancer treatment through drug combinations is critical for improving healthcare outcomes, increasing effectiveness, and reducing side effects. Computational methods have become increasingly important to prioritize synergistic drug pairs because of the vast search space of possible chemicals. However, existing approaches typically rely solely on global molecular structures, neglecting information exchange between different modality representations and interactions between molecular and fine-grained fragments, leading to limited understanding of drug synergy mechanisms for personalized treatment. To address these limitations, we propose MOSAIC (Multi-granularity crOSs-modAl method for synergIstic drug combinations prediCtion), an AI-driven multi-granularity cross-modal method for personalized synergistic drug combination prediction that considers both molecular and fragment-level features. MOSAIC employs a dual-layer representation system, decomposing molecules into chemically meaningful fragments using the BRICS algorithm, facilitating information exchange between graph and SMILES representations through a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism, and ensuring semantic consistency of different modal representations of the same molecular fragment through a contrastive learning framework. Additionally, we designed a bilinear attention network to capture interactions between fragments of different drugs and dynamically integrate multi-granularity feature relationships through a multi-head attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, MOSAIC demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

40901703,Multimodal deep learning for immunotherapy response prediction and biomarker discovery in non-small cell lung cancer.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but accurately predicting which patients will benefit from it remains a major clinical challenge. To address this, we aim to develop a novel multimodal method, DeepAFM, that integrates histopathology, genomic features, and clinical information to predict patient responses to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A total of 93 patients with advanced NSCLC were included in this study. Histopathological whole-slide images were processed using a self-supervised VQVAE2 for representation learning. PCA and K-means clustering were then applied for dimensionality reduction and feature grouping. Key regions of interest were visualized through permutation importance evaluation and color-coding techniques. The extracted histopathological features, along with genomic alterations and clinical variables, were integrated into the DeepAFM multimodal prediction model.<h4>Results</h4>The DeepAFM achieved a high predictive performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-1.00). Attention-based heatmaps revealed that the model could identify critical pathological patterns, genomic mutations, and clinical indicators associated with patient responses to immunotherapy.<h4>Discussion</h4>The integration of multimodal data enabled the model to capture complex interactions among pathology, genomics, and clinical characteristics, enhancing the interpretability and predictive power of immunotherapy response prediction. The visualization techniques facilitated the identification of biologically meaningful features and potential biomarkers.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the DeepAFM in predicting responses to immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC.

40892642,FIGNet: A Robust and Interpretable Fuzzy-Irreversible Gated Network for Auditory Brainstem Response Classification.,"Auditory brainstem response (ABR) is an important tool for newborn hearing screening and neurological assessment. However, its signals are often difficult to be accurately resolved due to noise interference and weak waveforms, and the need for repeated measurements under multiple sound intensity conditions results in time-consuming data acquisition. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an automatic classification model with high accuracy, robustness and good interpretability to achieve stable and effective recognition performance with minimal ABR data. This study presents FIGNet, a new deep learning model that combines type-2 fuzzy logic with a time-irreversible attention mechanism to address uncertainty and temporal direction in ABR signals. Fuzzy attention helps reduce the impact of noise, while the irreversible attention models the one-way nature of neural responses. Experiments on real ABR datasets show that FIGNet outperforms existing models in both binary and five-class classification tasks. It achieves 93.72% accuracy in binary classification and 84.42% accuracy in five-class classification. Visualization results-including confusion matrices, and accuracy curves under different noise levels-further confirm that FIGNet can focus on key waveform areas and stay reliable even in noisy conditions. These findings demonstrate that FIGNet offers fast, interpretable, and robust performance for clinical ABR analysis, achieving high classification accuracy under both clean and noisy conditions.",Zhang K; Zhao C; Li Z; Li C; Jia D; Chen Y; Yan S; Wang X; Teng Y; Pan H; Chen S,,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2025-09-02,10.1109/jbhi.2025.3604834,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

40897835,Super-Resolution MR Spectroscopic Imaging via Diffusion Models for Tumor Metabolism Mapping.,"High-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) plays a crucial role in characterizing tumor metabolism and guiding clinical decisions for glioma patients. However, due to inherently low metabolite concentrations and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limitations, MRSI data are often acquired at low spatial resolution, hindering accurate visualization of tumor heterogeneity and margins. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework based on conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models for super-resolution reconstruction of MRSI, with a particular focus on mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gliomas. The model progressively transforms noise into high-fidelity metabolite maps through a learned reverse diffusion process, conditioned on low-resolution inputs. Leveraging a Self-Attention UNet backbone, the proposed approach integrates global contextual features and achieves superior detail preservation. On simulated patient data, the proposed method achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values of 0.956, 0.939, and 0.893; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values of 29.73, 27.84, and 26.39 dB; and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) values of 0.025, 0.036, and 0.045 for upsampling factors of 2, 4, and 8, respectively, with LPIPS improvements statistically significant compared to all baselines ( p<0.01 ). We validated the framework on in vivo MRSI from healthy volunteers and glioma patients, where it accurately reconstructed small lesions, preserved critical textural and structural information, and enhanced tumor boundary delineation in metabolic ratio maps, revealing heterogeneity not visible in other approaches. These results highlight the promise of diffusion-based deep learning models as clinically relevant tools for noninvasive, high-resolution metabolic imaging in glioma and potentially other neurological disorders.",Alsubaie M; Perera SM; Gu L; Subasi SB; Andronesi OC; Li X,"Department of Mathematics, College of Khurma University College, Taif Univeristy, Taif, 21944, Saudi Arabia.",Journal of imaging informatics in medicine,2025-09-02,10.1007/s10278-025-01652-x,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Diffusion model; MRSI; Tumor Metabolism; Super-resolution; Deep Learning
40910754,"SmokePath Explorer - a data driven smoke management tool to support prescribed fire planning in California, USA.","SmokePath Explorer is a web-based decision-support tool for California, U.S.A. that quantifies smoke transport probability and population exposure risk across the state, enabling data-driven strategies to minimize impacts while advancing fire management effectiveness. SmokePath integrates the California and Nevada Smoke and Air Committee (CANSAC) high-resolution (2-km) 20-year reanalysis climatology with HYSPLIT trajectory modeling. A total of 1.3 billion transport trajectories were precomputed with initializations four times per day at four distinct height levels capturing diurnal variations and injection height influences across various prescribed fire scenarios to support probabilistic smoke projections. Within the SmokePath online dashboard, users can input fire parameters and select specific months or weeks to assess smoke transport risk. The tool generates risk-level smoke transport contours from precomputed data and summarizes key meteorological variables. The system also provides population exposure estimates, including the total affected population, the number of smoke-sensitive facilities (i.e. educational and healthcare), and impacted USPS ZIP codes. User feedback has been key to developing SmokePath, enhancing usability, data integration, and decision-making for prescribed fire planning. To assess SmokePath's efficacy, we conducted case studies across diverse regions and validated results against independent observation datasets. These use cases assessed the accuracy of the WRF-CANSAC reanalysis dataset, which serves as the meteorological input for fire weather climatology and trajectory modeling. The fire case studies focused on identifying optimal burn windows and quantifying smoke transport patterns from (i) large multi-day prescribed fires, (ii) short duration (single-day) pile burns, and (iii) burns across diverse regions with complex topographic features. In most cases, modeled transport probability aligned with satellite-observed smoke plumes, capturing predominant dispersion patterns. Stakeholder feedback further supported the tool's practical utility - 85% indicated they would use SmokePath for prescribed fire planning, and 62% found it useful during wildfires.ImplicationsWith increasing number of catastrophic wildfires causing billions in damage and significant loss of life, California is set to dramatically expand fuel treatment efforts, including prescribed fire. While essential for wildfire mitigation, prescribed fires emit air pollutants that, if not carefully managed, can degrade air quality and pose serious public health risks. To confront these challenges - and in response to the state's Strategic Plan for proactive and consistent smoke management - we developed SmokePath. The tool provides evidence of expected smoke plume behavior for short-term and long-term planning. SmokePath's features help land managers prioritize prescribed fires during periods with minimal community impact, particularly for vulnerable populations. Beyond prescribed fire planning, SmokePath is a potential powerful asset for wildfire response, delivering climatology-based insights on smoke impacts to decision-makers for swift public communication and mitigation. By rapidly providing smoke risk information, the system will enable more timely public messaging regarding potential smoke exposure and mitigation strategies, particularly for disadvantaged communities. This functionality will help improve risk communication, allowing affected populations to take proactive measures to reduce exposure and protect public health, while advancing the strategic use of prescribed fire as a wildfire mitigation tool.",Zare-Harofteh A; Kramer SJ; Huang S; Scarborough CR; Besong K; Kumar N; Brown T; Hosseinpour F,"Desert Research Institute, Reno, Nevada, USA.",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995),2025-09-05,10.1080/10962247.2025.2553822,2.8,"dashboard(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
40892129,Image-enhanced endoscopy in upper GI tract: State-of-the-art review.,"Early and accurate identification of upper gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies remains a cornerstone for improving clinical outcomes. Conventional white light endoscopy, although the standard diagnostic modality, often fails to detect subtle premalignant and early neoplastic changes. Image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) addresses these limitations by improving visualization of surface structures and vascular patterns. Despite its proven diagnostic value, IEE remains underutilized in resource-limited settings, largely due to lack of training and standardization. Adoption of structured training programs and digital learning tools could help bridge these gaps and enhance the detection of early GI neoplasms. This comprehensive review outlines the clinical utility of IEE in upper GI endoscopy, with a particular focus on narrow band imaging. Practical tips for usage are provided on equipment selection, procedural preparation and standardized examination techniques such as the Systematic Screening Protocol for the Stomach (SSS).

40897881,Fluorescence-guided sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass: first-in-human trial using novel gastric calibration tube.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Fluorescence-guided surgery employs a near-infrared emitting dye or light source to enhance intraoperative visualization. This study reports the first-in-human application of the Endolumik fluorescence-guided calibration tube (EGCT) during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and gastric bypass (GB).<h4>Methods</h4>Under IRB approval (NCT05486325), two surgeons performed 21 laparoscopic SG and 10 GB procedures using EGCT. Evacuation of gastric contents, gastric sleeve/pouch calibration, and leak testing were performed. Surgical and anesthesia providers completed surveys evaluating their EGCT experience.<h4>Results</h4>No device-related adverse events occurred. EGCT was used by 10/5 unique surgical team members during SG/GB, respectively, and by 20/5 anesthesia providers. All surgical team members rated device experience as good or very good compared to the standard bougie. Visualization during gastric sleeve construction was rated as good or very good, and very good for gastric pouch construction. All surgical members reported confidence in the device enabling consistent gastric sleeve or pouch sizing. EGCT increased surgeon confidence level for device introduction during GB. Among anesthesia providers, 84% rated their experience during SG with the device as good or very good, including 89.5% of CRNAs. Additionally, 75%/90% of SG/GB clinicians believed the device reduced the likelihood of adverse events compared to standard devices. The average likelihood to recommend the EGCT was 9 out of 10 among surgeons.<h4>Conclusion</h4>EGCT improved visualization during gastric sleeve and pouch construction and increased confidence during device introduction for GB; surgeons would recommend the device to colleagues.

40897168,[Diseases of the Thymus in domestic mammals: Significance and diagnosis].,"In contrast to human medicine, thymic disorders receive little attention as differential diagnoses in veterinary medicine. The aim of this overview is to provide information on the current state of knowledge concerning the topographical anatomy, physiological development, and involution, function, and diseases of the thymus as well as the diagnosis of thymic disorders in various domestic mammals. Therefore, literature on this topic was searched and summarized. The anatomical extent and developmental/involutionary processes differ significantly from species to species. The thymus reaches its maximum size at the beginning of sexual maturity whereas it is largely absent or persists in mere residual form in adult animals. Dogs and goats represent an exception, as functional thymus tissue may also be found in adults. Imaging is often difficult, depending on the size of the animal and the location of the organ. Due to the poor visualization and mostly unspecific clinical signs, disorders of the thymus pose a diagnostic challenge. The thymus may change in size and structure in response to stress or disease. This can lead to impaired immune function and subsequently to infectious diseases. Neoplasia of the thymus has been widely described in domestic mammals. Most reports are found for dogs and goats. Clinical signs usually appear when the tumor becomes space-occupying due to its size or they become apparent in consequence to the occurrence of paraneoplastic syndromes. These may for example include myasthenia gravis. More than 50% of dogs with a thymoma develop a paraneoplastic syndrome. With the availability of modern imaging, assessing the thymus may in future become simpler and may prove useful in evaluating the health status of young animals.",Diel E; Wehrend A,"Tierklinik für Reproduktionsmedizin und Neugeborenenkunde, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen.","Tierarztliche Praxis.

Suspicious breast calcifications on mammography often prompt further diagnostic evaluation due to concern for malignancy, worrying physicians and patients alike. Here, we present a case of a woman in her 70s whose annual screening mammogram with digital breast tomosynthesis demonstrated two new groups of microcalcifications, confirmed after recall with magnification views. However, because of their superficial location, biopsy was thought to be too technically challenging and short follow-up was recommended. At 6-month mammographic follow-up, there was interval non-visualization of both calcifications. Additional clinical history interrogation revealed that due to a diffuse pruritic rash, the patient had been applying topical betamethasone dipropionate daily to her entire body, including her breasts, when she received her initial mammogram. This case illustrates how corticosteroid ointments and lotions may mimic suspicious calcifications on mammography, reinforcing the importance of guidelines recommending avoidance of topical products on the day of imaging.",Pearce H; Spoont J; Sanchez Aguirre P; Pluguez-Turull C,"University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, USA.",European journal of breast health,2025-09-04,10.4274/ejbh.galenos.2025.2025-6-1,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Breast Imaging; mammography; Breast Cancer Screenings; Pseudocalcifications
40898339,Lasting impact of undergraduate operating room shadowing on novice nurses: a ChatGPT-supported qualitative study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Operating room (OR) shadowing allows nursing students to observe high-stakes teamwork and clinical decision-making. However, the emotional and professional impact of such experiences on novice nurses remains underexplored.<h4>Methods</h4>This qualitative study explored how a single episode of OR shadowing during undergraduate clinical training influenced novice nurses' emotional responses and professional development. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six novice nurses within their first year of clinical practice. Transcripts were analyzed using a ChatGPT-assisted thematic and sentiment analysis approach. Semantic clustering and emotion-frequency visualizations were also applied to enhance interpretive transparency.<h4>Results</h4>Six superordinate themes and 19 subthemes were identified: (1) Communication and Teamwork, (2) Holistic and Empathetic Care, (3) Patient Safety and Ethical Awareness, (4) Professional Identity and Role Formation, (5) Skill Development and Clinical Preparedness, and (6) Transformative and Experiential Learning. Participants expressed a range of emotions-most notably respect, gratitude, admiration, and growth-which were strongly associated with reflections on ethical practice, role modeling, and future aspirations. Visualization techniques revealed that emotionally resonant experiences were often thematically clustered, suggesting shared meaning structures across participants. Despite the brevity of the experience, many participants described lasting effects on their clinical attitudes, ethical awareness, and self-concept as nurses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A single OR shadowing experience during undergraduate education can evoke deep emotional responses and support early professional identity formation among novice nurses. The integration of structured reflection or guided debriefing may enhance these effects. Findings support the inclusion of observational experiences, even brief ones, in undergraduate nursing curricula as a means to cultivate ethical sensitivity, interprofessional awareness, and reflective practice.",Hara K; Tachibana R; Kumashiro R; Inoue T,"Department of Fundamental Nursing, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, 4-24-1 Kuhonji, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto City, Kumamoto, 862-0976, Japan. kentaro-hara@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.",BMC nursing,2025-09-02,10.1186/s12912-025-03770-x,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Nursing Education; Emotional Responses; Reflective Learning; Novice Nurses; Operating Room Shadowing
40889398,Surgical management of biventricular hydrocephalus caused by tuberculosis-induced bilateral obstruction of the foramen of Monro: illustrative case.,"<h4>Background</h4>Occlusion of the foramen of Monro is an exceedingly rare condition in adults and can lead to obstructive hydrocephalus. The authors present the first reported case of biventricular hydrocephalus caused by tuberculosis-induced bilateral obstruction of the foramen of Monro. They also discuss the technical nuances and surgical challenges associated with this condition.<h4>Observations</h4>A 47-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of short-term memory disturbances, ultimately leading to loss of consciousness. Neuroimaging revealed symmetrical biventricular hydrocephalus accompanied by periventricular interstitial edema. A lumbar puncture indicated lymphocytic-dominant pleocytosis and reduced glucose levels. During the endoscopic approach, significant stenosis of the foramen of Monro was noticed and monroplasty and septostomy were performed. Pathological examination revealed granulomatous inflammation. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient demonstrated significant clinical and radiological improvement, with resolution of symptoms and hydrocephalus.<h4>Lessons</h4>Tuberculosis-induced bilateral idiopathic occlusion of the foramen of Monro is an extremely uncommon cause of hydrocephalus. Neuroendoscopy allows for visualization, biopsy, and direct treatment of the obstruction simultaneously. While conservative management may be adequate for asymptomatic cases, neuroendoscopic procedures such as septostomy or foraminoplasty provide a minimally invasive option for restoring CSF flow, avoiding unnecessary shunt insertion in symptomatic cases. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE25349.",Ebrahimzadeh K; Mirahmadi Eraghi M; Hallajnejad M; Mousavian ST; Ansari M; Sabeti S,"Skull Base Research Center, Loghman Hakim Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",Journal of neurosurgery.

The safety was evaluated based on reported adverse events (AEs), including serious AEs, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and safety laboratory parameters. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition was performed precontrast and postcontrast to assess the clinical relevance of images in primary breast tumors, liver, and pancreas relative to reference tissue. PK parameters were calculated from a noncompartmental analysis of the plasma Mn concentrations versus time.<h4>Results</h4>There was a total of 29 AEs reported to all participants of the 2 cohorts. The AEs were mostly of mild to moderate severity and possibly or probably related to the contrast agent. No clinically significant changes in the safety laboratory parameters were reported, except for transiently elevated transaminases observed at the end of the infusion. Clinically relevant low-background MRI scans for clinical visualization of primary breast tumor, liver, and pancreas were obtained at the expanded dose level.

40914558,Reversible increased basement membrane permeability and calcium ion redistribution facilitate ultrasound-enhanced transdermal drug delivery efficiency.,"<h4>Background</h4>Ultrasound-assisted transdermal drug delivery, or sonophoresis, enhances skin permeability, offering a non-invasive alternative for drug administration. However, its clinical application remains limited because of an insufficient understanding of its underlying mechanisms and optimal parameters. This study investigates the factors influencing ultrasound-enhanced drug absorption and examines its biological effects on skin structures and HaCaT cells, providing a comprehensive analysis of its mechanisms.<h4>Methods</h4>In vivo two-photon microscopy was used for real-time visualization of drug penetration in live mice. Ultrasound-induced changes in skin structures were examined using electron microscopy, focusing on alterations in epidermal intercellular junctions and basement membrane structure. Immunofluorescence staining was used to assess keratinocyte adhesion and cytoskeletal changes, while fluorescent calcium probes measured intracellular calcium dynamics in HaCaT cells. Additionally, mechanical stretch experiments were conducted to evaluate cellular responses to mechanical stress after ultrasound exposure.<h4>Results</h4>Ultrasound treatment enhanced drug penetration by inducing structural changes in the epidermis. Ultrasound application altered the basement membrane structure, leading to enlarged pore size and decreased fiber density, which facilitated drug delivery. Nevertheless, these changes were reversible within 2 h after ultrasound treatment. Ultrasound exposure also altered intracellular calcium distribution in HaCaT cells, contributing to changes in cytoskeletal structure and cell adhesion. Furthermore, ultrasound-treated cells exhibited reduced resistance to external mechanical stress. These findings suggested that ultrasound could promote drug delivery by changing skin structures, modulating calcium ion distribution, and altering cell adhesion and morphology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of ultrasound-enhanced transdermal drug delivery, including real-time in vivo observations of drug penetration and the reversible effects on skin structure. These findings provide a better understanding of ultrasound's potential for safe and effective drug delivery, contributing to its future clinical applications.",Zheng Y; Meng X; Zhang E; Guo R; Feng Y; Fan W; Lu J; Lu Y,"Department of Dermatology, The Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Baita West Road 16, Suzhou, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China; Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Guangzhou Road 300, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.",International journal of pharmaceutics,2025-09-04,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2025.126125,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),ultrasound; HaCaT cells; Sonophoresis; Transdermal Drug Absorption; Ultrasonic Transdermal Delivery
40890383,Impact of cone system compatibility on single cone bioceramic obturation in canals prepared with variable taper NiTi rotary files.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study examined how system-matching gutta-percha (GP) cones in conjunction with calcium silicate-based sealers (CSBS) affect the sealing quality of canals prepared with variable taper nickel titanium (NiTi) files, using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Forty-eight extracted human mandibular premolars were instrumented using the ProTaper Ultimate and divided into four groups based on GP cone (system-matching vs. non-matching) and sealer type (PlanB vs. TotalFill). Obturation was performed using the single-cone technique. Sealers were mixed with Fluo-3 dye for CLSM visualization. Micro-CT was used to quantify voids and gaps, while CLSM evaluated sealer penetration area and depth at the coronal, middle, and apical thirds.<h4>Results</h4>There were no significant differences in overall voids and gaps percentages between the cone systems (p = 0.66). System-matching cones however, significantly enhanced sealer penetration into dentinal tubules in terms of area, average, and maximum depth, especially in the apical third (p ≤ 0.001). PlanB demonstrated greater penetration area than TotalFill (p = 0.039).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of system-matching versus non-matching gutta-percha cones does not significantly affect the overall occurrence of voids and gaps in root canal fillings. However, system-matching cones improve sealer penetration into dentinal tubules, which differs among calcium silicate-based sealers. This emphasizes the importance of both cone fit and sealer selection in optimizing the quality of the single-cone obturation technique.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>In canals prepared with variable taper NiTi files, both the compatibility of gutta-percha cones and the properties of calcium silicate-based sealers play a key role in enhancing the quality of the single-cone obturation technique.",Barakat RM; Almohareb RA; Aleid N; Almowais H; Alharbi A; Al-Sharafa M; Alrahlah A,"Dental Clinics Department, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz University Hospital, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, P.O.

40907333,Sakuranetin inhibits osteoclastogenesis and rescues the ovariectomy-induced bone loss by blocking PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathway.,"<h4>Background</h4>Bone remodeling constitutes an intricate physiological process essential for maintaining skeletal integrity. Hyperactivation of osteoclastogenesis precipitates excessive resorption of osseous tissue, consequently engendering osteoporotic pathology. The formulation of effective anti-resorptive therapeutic modalities remains a potential strategy in the clinical management of osteoporosis.<h4>Methods</h4>We elucidated the modulatory effects of sakuranetin (Sak), a prominent member of the natural flavonoid repertoire, on RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining (TRAP), F-actin cytoskeletal visualization, and resorptive lacunae formation assays were employed to quantify its inhibitory capacity in vitro. Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis was subsequently undertaken to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying Sak's bioactivity, with salient pathways corroborated through immunoblotting and immunofluorescence methodologies. Ultimately, an ovariectomized (OVX) murine model was established to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Sak against osteoporosis in vivo.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings demonstrated that Sak exerted profound inhibitory effects on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and concomitant osseous resorptive activity. Transcriptomic analysis elucidated the downregulation of osteoclast-specific molecular markers, concurrent with attenuation of NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signaling cascades following Sak administration. Subsequent experimental investigations revealed that Sakeffectively suppressed phosphorylation of IκB, p65, AKT, and c-Fos, while concurrently impeding nuclear translocation of p65 and c-Fos transcription factors through direct molecular interaction with NF-κB and AKT proteins, thereby substantiating mechanistic inhibition of NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signaling cascades. In the ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic model, Sak administration elicited significant restoration of bone microarchitectural parameters and attenuated osteoclast abundance in vivo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identifies Sak as a potent inhibitor of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, exerting its effects predominantly through the suppression of NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. The remarkable capacity of Sak to attenuate the expression of osteoclast-specific genetic markers and impede critical signal transduction events underscores its considerable potential as a therapeutic candidate for skeletal demineralization and osteoporotic disorders.",Shen B; Du Y; Wang R; Zhang Y; Cao Y; Zhao L; Zhou B; Yang L; Zhu Z,"Department of Spine Surgery, Shanghai East Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.",International immunopharmacology,2025-09-03,10.1016/j.intimp.2025.115460,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Osteoporosis; Osteoclast; NF-κB; Pi3k/akt; Sakuranetin
40900942,In Situ Pulmonary Artery Thrombosis and Low Flow Stasis Artifact in Parenchymal Lung Disease: An Under-Recognized Phenomenon.,"Pulmonary emboli (PE) are a common clinical problem seen when a peripheral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) migrates to the pulmonary arteries. However, emerging literature suggests that not all filling defects in the pulmonary arteries are the result of embolism, and that in situ pulmonary arterial thrombus (ISPAT) or low-flow stasis artifact (LFSA) within the pulmonary arteries can mimic acute PE. The proposed mechanism for ISPAT is chronic stasis due to abnormal perfusion in areas of parenchymal lung disease leading to in situ thrombosis. Similarly, LFSA occurs when stasis leads to persistent visualization of intravenous contrast which is then mistaken for thrombus. The clinical scenarios in which ISPAT and LFSA develop are not yet fully defined. We report here a series of patients with parenchymal lung disease leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch who likely had ISPAT or LFSA and not acute PE. Our aim is to further define parenchymal lung disease as a subgroup of patients who are at high risk for ISPAT. Cases initially diagnosed as acute PE leading to activation of the UCLA pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were all cases of PE that led to PERT activation. Inclusion criteria included absence of DVT, previously diagnosed pulmonary disease, and presence of thrombus only in areas of abnormal parenchyma. Cases were reviewed with radiology to identify cases in which ISPAT was the likely diagnosis, and five representative cases were selected to be discussed. These cases were then analyzed qualitatively for commonalities which are described below. The five representative cases described represent patients with known chronic lung disease who were diagnosed and initially managed as acute PE but, on review, met criteria for either ISPAT or stasis artifact. These cases, which were all rediagnosed as ISPAT or LFSA, were all seen in the absence of DVT, with thrombus specifically located in areas of significant parenchymal lung disease with suspected decrease in ventilation and perfusion in these areas. ISPAT or LFSA have been described in the literature, though its presence specifically in parenchymal lung disease has yet to be described. The authors recommend considering this diagnosis in patient's diagnosed with acute PE when the following are present: significant parenchymal lung disease, absence of DVT, absence of thrombus in the areas of the lung relatively spared of parenchymal lung disease, and suspected baseline decrease in both ventilation and perfusion to the affected areas of the lung. As this phenomenon may be physiologically beneficial, the authors suggest that not all cases of ISPAT or LFSA need anticoagulation, and that treatment should be considered on a case-by-case basis.",Mansour J; Dekitani K; Abtin F; Saggar R; Channick R,Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine University of California Los Angeles Medical Center Los Angeles California USA.,Pulmonary circulation,2025-09-01,10.1002/pul2.70129,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40911870,How to Improve Pancreatic Cancer Network Care Using a Human-Centered Design Sprint.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Pancreatic cancer is considered a complex cancer requiring specific expertise in diagnostic workup and multimodality treatment. Often, multiple health care providers in different hospitals are involved during patient care. This fragmentation of care challenges health care providers in the network to deliver efficient, coherent, and continuous network care. We performed a human-centered design (HCD) sprint in order to find means to improve network care for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The sprint comprised 5 days with different goals: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Experts and stakeholders were approached from the pancreatic cancer network to contribute. By using HCD, a goal was defined, various prototypes were explored, and one prototype was tested. The HCD Sprint led to a shared goal, which was to deliver pancreatic cancer network care in a (virtual) hospital in which there is ""one narrative."" This means that the patient's context and preferences are always clear and taken into account, care is characterized by a short time to diagnosis and treatment, and patient data are easily available for patients and involved clinicians. The accompanying prototypes were (1) network agreements, (2) patient itinerary, (3) transmural trajectory guidance, and (4) data sharing. For the latter, we developed and pilot-tested a real-time data sharing dashboard called CONNECT. The first pilot-test was promising and provided feedback for further development. In this viewpoint paper, we show that a HCD sprint is able to find possible means to improve pancreatic network care in a short time span. A real-time data sharing dashboard (CONNECT) was developed and pilot tested. The next steps include further development of the dashboard, implementation in our network, and long-term evaluation studies.",Hopstaken JS; Koeneman M; Hooijer R; van Rijssel CC; van Voorthuizen T; Oort FA; Blanken CFJM; de Groot M; van Laarhoven CJHM; Stommel MWJ,"Department of Surgery, Radboudumc, Geert Grooteplein 10 (route 618), Nijmegen, 6525 GA, The Netherlands, 31 0243668086.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-09-05,10.2196/55598,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Prototype; Diagnosis; Treatment; Pancreatic; Pancreatic cancer; Implementation; Real-time; Patient; Care; Netherlands; Interview; Continuity Of Care; Patient Care; Clinician; experience; Gastroenterologist; Ehealth; Surgeon; Oncologist; Expert; Stakeholder; Human-centered Design; Continuous Care; Network Care
40888158,Implementation of the Age-Friendly Health Systems Initiative in the Department of Veterans Affairs: 5 Years of Improving Quality for Older Veterans.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>The Age-Friendly Health Systems initiative (AFHS) was developed to spread principles of high-quality care for older adults using the 4Ms Framework: What Matters, Medications, Mentation and Mobility. In 2020, the Veterans Health Affairs (VA) set a goal to become an AFHS, given nearly half of Veterans are over aged 65.<h4>Methods</h4>This quality improvement study followed the Model for Improvement which guided a series of Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles to implement and spread the AFHS model within the VA, as measured by clinical sites receiving AFHS recognition from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). A national AFHS Steering Committee was formed, followed by a 4Ms note template and dashboard. VA ran 3 AFHS Action Communities which included synchronous training sessions and coaching calls in 4Ms care. IHI recognition was tracked over 5 years for VA sites. The Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 guidelines (SQuIRE) were used.<h4>Results</h4>From 2020 to 2025, 455 VA care settings earned Level 1 recognition from IHI at 138/139 (99%) of VA parent facilities. 268/455 (59%) sites have gone on to achieve Level 2 recognition. 66% of Level 1 sites are ambulatory, 7% are acute care, and 24% are nursing homes. Since 2022 when the VA AFHS note template was implemented, 163 000 unique Veterans have been recorded as having been reached with 4Ms care, of whom 71% reside in urban areas, 23% are aged 85 and older, and 59% are aged 65 to 84.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The VA implemented the AFHS initiative at nearly all VA parent facilities over 5 years, spreading the 4Ms model of Age-Friendly care across geographic and care settings. Further study is needed on the clinical impact of and optimal implementation strategies for AFHS. The VA experience offers a promising model for health systems seeking to implement AFHS.",Schwartz AW; Jindal SK; Wozneak KA; Burke RE,"New England Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2025-09-01,10.1177/00469580251366883,1.5,dashboard(abstract),Quality improvement; Geriatric; Veteran; Age-friendly; Pdsa Cycle
