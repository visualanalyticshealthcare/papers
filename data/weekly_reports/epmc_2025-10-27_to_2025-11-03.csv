41145796,Multilayer and crushed stent visualization using photon- counting detector computed tomography - a proof of concept.,"Photon‑counting detector CT (PCD‑CT) enables ultra‑high resolution (UHR, 0.2 mm) and may improve visualization of coronary stents compared with standard‑resolution (SR, 0.4 mm). In this ex- vivo study, we utilized a phantom heart model to simulate physiological attenuation and imitated the most common coronary bifurcation stenting techniques by creating multiple stent layers and stent- crush situations (single layer, crushed, two‑ and three‑layer). We compared UHR and SR PCD‑CT using Bv72 and Bv56 kernels. Objective endpoints were in‑stent lumen visibility, signal-to-noise ratio, and percentage change in stent attenuation; subjective image quality was rated on a 5‑point Likert scale (1 = excellent to 5 = non‑diagnostic). Depending on distribution, two‑sided t‑tests (mean ± SD) or Mann-Whitney U tests (median[IQR]) were applied, p‑values were Bonferroni‑corrected for multiple comparisons. In the pooled Crush cohort, UHR Bv72 improved in‑stent lumen visibility when compared with both, SR Bv72 (single-layer: 68.08 ± 4.30% vs. 79.03 ± 3.79%; crushed: 63.62 ± 4.97% vs. 74.73 ± 2.51%) and SR Bv56 (single-layer: 63.63 ± 4.47% vs. 79.03 ± 3.79%; crushed: 62.18 ± 3.55% vs. 74.73 ± 2.51%), all p < 0.01. The effect was even more pronounced in small stents (single‑layer 65.45 ± 1.91% (SR) vs. 77.11 ± 2.55% (UHR) and crushed 60.67 ± 2.67% vs. 74.00 ± 2.67%), both p < 0.01. Regarding subjective image quality, UHR was associated with better sharpness and less blooming, e.g., UHR Bv72 vs. SR Bv56 (multilayer: sharpness 1[0] vs. 2[0], blooming 1[0] vs. 2[0]; crush: sharpness 1[0] vs. 2[0], blooming 1[0] vs. 2[1]; all p ≤ 0.01) and UHR Bv72 vs. SR Bv72 (multilayer: sharpness 1[0] vs. 1[1], blooming 1[0] vs. 1[1]; crush: sharpness 1[0] vs. 1[1]; all p ≤ 0.05). These findings indicate that UHR PCD‑CT with Bv72 might enable assessment of complex stents in a phantom setting; even though clinical studies are warranted.",Harmel E; Hellbrueck S; Bongiovanni D; Raake P; Kroencke T; Decker JA; Bittner DO,"Department of Internal Medicine I, Cardiology, University Hospital Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.",Scientific reports,2025-10-27,10.1038/s41598-025-25119-9,11.5,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract)",Ultra High Resolution; Photon Counting Detector Computed Tomography; Bifurcation Stent Visualization
41175973,Utilization of an electronic health record dashboard report to monitor unreconciled controlled substance dispenses.,"<h4>Background</h4>A medication is considered unreconciled when there is no documented administration or the dispensed amount does not match the amount administered, wasted, or returned. Unreconciled dispenses pose several issues, including inaccurate accounting of controlled substances, potential financial discrepancies, possible masking of controlled substance diversion, and patient safety concerns. Utilization of an electronic health record (EHR) report of unreconciled dispenses is one of several possible surveillance methods to track unreconciled dispenses and detect potential controlled substance diversion.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study is to determine the extent to which the utilization of an EHR reporting dashboard by nursing leaders decreases the number of unreconciled controlled substance dispenses.<h4>Methods</h4>An existing report available through the EHR will be used to identify a baseline of unreconciled dispenses. A dashboard was built to include the unreconciled dispenses report that provided real-time data as well as a visualization of historical data. This dashboard was integrated into the nursing leadership workflow on several pilot units covering different levels of care and reviewed regularly for potential intervention. Nurse managers were expected to communicate directly with nurses that had unreconciled controlled substance dispenses and re-educate on appropriate documentation procedures.<h4>Results</h4>During the pre-intervention period, there were a total of 26,101 controlled substance dispenses with 256 unreconciled dispenses (0.98%). Following implementation of the dashboard report, there was a non-significant decrease of 0.13% (p = 0.14) with a total of 24,731 controlled substance dispenses and 211 unreconciled dispenses (0.85%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of an EHR dashboard report has the potential to improve the documentation of controlled substances by identifying opportunities to correct unreconciled dispenses. However, workflow barriers can impact the utility of and engagement with the dashboard report.",Le C; Mellett J; Barreto J; Lopez B,"Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.

41146008,Z-GENIE: a user-friendly R/Shiny resource for predicting Z-DNA forming regions in DNA.,"<h4>Background</h4>Z-DNA is a left-handed DNA conformation with a zigzag backbone whose formation depends on base composition, modifications, and environmental factors. Although energetically unfavorable, Z-DNA has been implicated in both normal physiology and disease. The Z-Hunt algorithm predicts Z-DNA potential from thermodynamic principles, but its command-line interface and plain-text outputs limit adoption by users without coding expertise.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce Z-GENIE, an R/Shiny GUI that automates Z-Hunt execution, parses its output, and presents interactive visualizations. Z-GENIE accepts FASTA files, NCBI accession IDs, or manual sequences and produces CSV and BED summaries compatible with genomic browsers. In benchmarks on small to medium genomes (< 20 Mb), Z-Hunt completes in minutes and the full Z-GENIE pipeline (data retrieval, parsing, visualization) finishes in under five minutes. For large genomes (> 50 Mb), Z-Hunt may require up to two hours, whereas Z-GENIE's parsing and BED-file export take < 2 min. In a human ADAM12 case study, Z-GENIE reproduced a published Z-score (3.0 × 10^7) and uncovered orientation-dependent Z-DNA clusters. Another case study compared predictions for Z-DNA in the rice genome (Oryza sativa) with experimental ZIP-Seq and CUT&Tag data; this study highlights the complementarity between in silico and in vivo approaches.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By encapsulating Z-Hunt within an intuitive GUI and offering flexible inputs and downstream-ready outputs, Z-GENIE democratizes genome-wide Z-DNA analysis. Its rapid performance and advanced visualization features should broaden exploration of Z-DNA's roles in health and disease.",Garza Reyna A; Fuentes M; Pisetsky DS,"Department of Integrative Immunobiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27705, USA. aig9@duke.edu.",BMC genomics,2025-10-27,10.1186/s12864-025-12148-x,9.0,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract); data(kw,abstract)",GUI; Sequence Motifs; Shiny Application; Z-dna Genomic Data Visualization; Z-genie; Z-hunt
41146074,The prognostic value of POD24 for multiple myeloma: a comprehensive analysis based on traditional statistics and machine learning.,"<h4>Background</h4>In multiple myeloma, progression within 24 months (POD24) is a strong adverse prognostic factor. However, its impact on overall survival (OS) remains underexplored through machine learning.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively collected clinical data from 155 patients and divided them into POD24 and non-POD24 groups. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, univariate Cox regression, and multivariate Cox regression. We further evaluated the effect of these variables on overall survival using ten machine-learning algorithms.<h4>Results</h4>KM and Cox regression analyses revealed significantly poorer OS in the POD24 group (p < 0.001). Among machine learning models, ANN achieved the best performance in the test set. PCA-based visualization showed clear class separation and prediction consistency with original feature distributions. SHAP analysis identified POD24 as the strongest model-derived predictor in this cohort of mortality. Force plots further demonstrated that non-POD24 substantially contributed to lower predicted death risk.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study suggests that POD24 may be associated to the survival outcomes in multiple myeloma using both traditional statistical and machine learning approaches. Our findings highlight the potential value of POD24 in mortality risk prediction and demonstrate the utilization of ANN-based SHAP interpretation in enhancing model transparency.",Zhang Q; Wang Y; Chen Q; Ma J; Lu C; Chen Y; Shi Y; Shi W; He Z; Yu L; Wang C,"Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China.",BMC cancer,2025-10-27,10.1186/s12885-025-15089-6,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Multiple myeloma; Artificial neural Network; Machine Learning; Overall Survival; Shap; Pod24

40193954,"Lesion Visualization of an Oral Manganese Contrast Agent Compared to Unenhanced MRI and Gadobenate Dimeglumine in Patients Undergoing Liver Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Evaluation of Colorectal Cancer Metastases: Centralized Assessment of a Randomized, Crossover, Phase II Study.","<h4>Objectives</h4>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the visualization capability of orally administered manganese chloride tetrahydrate (ACE-MBCA [Ascelia Pharma-manganese-based contrast agent, also referred to as Orviglance or CMC-001]), a novel liver-specific contrast agent developed by Ascelia Pharma, as a liver-specific MRI contrast agent compared with that of the unenhanced MRI for focal liver lesions in a properly blinded study design. The secondary objective was to compare the performance of ACE-MBCA with gadobenate dimeglumine.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Three independent readers analyzed MRI examinations from a previously completed randomized crossover clinical trial in a blinded manner in a centralized setting. The study included 20 consecutive adult patients with known or suspected liver metastases, who received both ACE-MBCA and gadobenate dimeglumine. The readers evaluated 6 types of MRI scans (unenhanced, enhanced, and combined MRI for both contrast agents) with lesion visualization [lesion border delineation (LBD) and lesion contrast (LC)] as primary outcome. To maintain the blinded nature of the study, all statistical analyses were performed by an independent statistician who was not involved in the image reading process. Differences in primary outcomes were performed using 1-sided paired t tests at a significance level of 0.025 for both parameters. For secondary outcomes (ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI visualization, lesion detection, size measurements, reader confidence, quantitative parameters, and image quality were compared with that of the other scans), descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate differences between categories in comparative analyses, without formal hypothesis testing for most secondary endpoints.<h4>Results</h4>ACE-MBCA-enhanced MRI demonstrated statistically significant superior scoring over unenhanced MRI for visualizing focal liver lesions, with mean LBD scores improving from 1.8-2.3 to 2.4-2.9 and LC scores ranging from 1.8-2.3 to 2.8-3.3 across all 3 readers ( P  < 0.001). Compared with unenhanced MRI, ACE-MBCA detected significantly more lesions across all readers (mean differences 0.4-0.8 lesions, 95% CI: 0.04-1.52), particularly for small lesions (<1 cm), where detection improved from 2-6 to 3-12 lesions. Liver-to-lesion contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios were also significantly higher after ACE-MBCA enhancement. All visualization parameters of ACE-MBCA were comparable to those of gadobenate dimeglumine, with no significant differences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared with unenhanced MRI, ACE-MBCA MRI resulted in superior visualization and a greater number of detected liver lesions.

41165516,Ultrabright NIR-II Nanoparticles for High-Resolution In Vivo Imaging: From Systemic Vasculature Visualization to Pathological Microenvironment Monitoring.,"Highly emissive fluorescence probes are crucial for precise disease diagnosis. To overcome the persistent limitations of low quantum yield in near-infrared-II (NIR-II) organic dyes, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogen, TPE-Hexoxyl, has been strategically designed. By synergistically suppressing π-π stacking and minimizing intramolecular charge transfer, we engineered NIR-II nanoparticles that rank among the brightest organic probes reported (absolute Φ<sub>PL</sub> = 0.9%). In vitro studies demonstrated that TPE-Hexoxyl nanoparticles exhibit exceptional colloidal stability and remarkable photostability. In vivo imaging displayed its high spatial resolution and prolonged tissue retention, enabling dynamic high-contrast visualization of systemic vasculature, cerebral microvasculature, and lymphatic networks. Remarkably, TPE-Hexoxyl nanoparticles show superior sensitivity in detecting tumor lesions in orthotopic 4T1 tumor-bearing mice models and achieve precise spatial mapping of inflammatory regions in inflammatory bowel disease models, underscoring their transformative potential for clinical pathological diagnostics.

41162850,Lower thoracic paravertebral block via posterior pathway of medial arcuate ligament under direct visualization versus transmuscular quadratus lumborum block for postoperative analgesia following retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy: a randomized controlled trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>The analgesic efficacy of transmuscular quadratus lumborum block (TQLB) as a means of decreasing the need for opioid use following laparoscopic nephrectomy has been demonstrated in several studies, but the effect of the lower thoracic paravertebral block via posterior pathway of medial arcuate ligament under direct visualization (LTPB-MAL) in this surgical context remains to be clearly elucidated.<h4>Objectives</h4>To juxtapose the pain-relieving potency of the TQLB and the LTPB-MAL in individuals receiving laparoscopic nephrectomy.<h4>Design</h4>A randomized controlled study.<h4>Setting</h4>University-affiliated tertiary care hospital.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred and two individuals slated for laparoscopic nephrectomy under general anesthesia were assigned to acquire either TQLB or LTPB-MAL by chance, with both groups receiving 25 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine post-surgery. The primary outcome was the total intravenous morphine equivalent doses consumed within the first day post-operatively. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity; interval to first opioids request; rescue analgesics use; and occurrence of nausea/vomiting; time to first ambulation; hospital duration and satisfaction scores.<h4>Results</h4>The patients receiving LTPB-MAL consumed significantly less intravenous morphine equivalent doses than those receiving TQLB in the first 24 h after surgery, with a mean (SD) of 23.5 (7.6) mg versus 33.6 (10.2) mg, P < 0.001, respectively. Time to the first opioid request in the LTPB-MAL group was significantly prolonged compared with the TQLB group, P < 0.001. No considerable discrepancy was observed in pain intensity, rescue pain consumption, satisfaction scores, incidence of nausea or vomiting, or ambulation and length of hospital stay within the two groups.<h4>Conclusion</h4>LTPB-MAL significantly reduces postoperative opioids usage in the first 24 h after surgery and delays the initial opioid request, endorsing it as an enhanced strategy for multimodal analgesia in laparoscopic nephrectomy.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The Ethics Committee of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital granted ethical approval for our study protocol on May 10, 2022 (2022-ke-447).

41148561,Deep learning model integrating contrast-enhanced ultrasound spatiotemporal imaging with clinical data for the differential diagnosis between hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aimed to develop a deep learning model, capable of extracting both spatial and temporal features from contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) data and integrating with patient clinical parameters, for the differential diagnosis between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed the CEUS data (ultrasound contrast agent: SonoVue®-sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles) from 165 ICC patients and 140 date-matched HCC patients. A deep learning model, namely CEUS-CD-Net, was developed to extract spatial-temporal features from dynamic CEUS data and integrate them with patient clinical parameters for the differential diagnosis between HCC and ICC. The performance of CEUS-CD-Net was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with comparisons against other methods including the single-source data-based models (CEUS-Net and CD-Net, based merely on dynamic CEUS or patient clinical data), CEUS static image-based model (sCEUS-Net), time-intensity curve-based model (TIC-Model), and the assessment by radiologists.<h4>Results</h4>CEUS-CD-Net achieved an AUC of 0.884 (95% CI, 0.794-0.938) on the test cohort, significantly outperforming the single-source data-based models of CEUS-Net (0.827 [0.730-0.896]) and CD-Net (0.812 [0.718-0.887]), as well as sCEUS-Net (0.772 [0.669-0.851]) and TIC-Model (0.731 [0.633-0.823]). In the subset of determinate cases, CEUS-CD-Net achieved an AUC of 0.893 [0.806-0.950], which was better than the one obtained by radiologists' assessment (0.790 [0.683-0.868]).

41152796,Convenience sampling of primary school students in Tianjin to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile-based virtual reality experimental learning in oral health education.,"<h4>Background</h4>Oral health education provides schoolchildren with correct information about health and oral health care techniques. Traditional oral health education has poor knowledge transmission effect. Virtual reality (VR) currently has extensive applications and excellent results in medical education and technical learning. However, its application in oral health education for primary school students has not yet been known.<h4>Methods</h4>A convenience sampling approach was employed to recruit 1,416 children in grades 3-5 from 16 districts of Tianjin City who had previously received traditional oral health education. One week prior to the intervention, parents received a quick response code to access the VR experience and were instructed to guide their children through the smartphone-based learning module. Then, medical staff administered questionnaires to the students in the classroom. VR efficacy was assessed by comparing oral health knowledge, attitudes, and technology acceptance between students exposed to VR and controls. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis H-tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests, and multiple linear regression analysis was employed to elucidate the pivotal factors influencing the efficacy of the oral VR experience.<h4>Result</h4>Children in grades 3-5 in Tianjin exhibited high receptivity to mobile-based VR technology, with a perceived ease of use of 9.03 ± 1.36 and a perceived usefulness of 9.40 ± 0.98. Among the students who experienced oral VR, 398 individuals (75%) reported a significant improvement in their attitudes towards oral health care, while 120 (22.6%) perceived a more substantial improvement. Students who experienced oral VR demonstrates a significant improvement in oral health knowledge (experimental group: 13.00(12.00,13.00) vs. control group: 10.00(8.00,12.00), p < 0.001). Schoolchildren in grade 4, with high father educational level, good brushing habits, and prior VR experience, achieved higher oral knowledge scores after the VR experience, with statistically significant differences observed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We present the first application of mobile virtual reality for oral health education in primary schools. Our study demonstrates high student acceptance of VR technology in Tianjin, China, alongside significant improvements in oral health knowledge and attitudes. Given its efficacy, accessibility, and visualization capabilities, mobile VR represents a promising tool for scalable oral health education.<h4>Trial registration</h4>International Standard Registered Clinical/Social Study Number Registry ISRCTN13464089(17/07/2025) ""Retrospectively registered"".",Nie S; Yuan D; Li C; Dai Y; Yang Y; Hu T,"Department of Preventive Dentistry, School of Medicine, Tianjin Stomatological Hospital, Nankai University and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Oral and Maxillofacial Function Reconstruction, Tianjin, China.",BMC oral health,2025-10-28,10.1186/s12903-025-07078-9,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Primary School; Technology Acceptance Model; Oral Health Education; Mobile-based Virtual Reality

41148114,Design and research of a wearable system for spinal deformity rehabilitation based on curvature and electromyography sensors.,"Abnormal spinal curvature poses a significant health risk to children and adolescents, highlighting the importance of maintaining good posture for spinal health. However, current posture detection methods face challenges such as insufficient detection accuracy, discomfort during use, and overall inconvenience. This study aims to design and implement a wearable system that integrates angle sensors and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors to monitor spinal alignment and muscle activity in real-time. The system consists of a smart vest equipped with flexible bending sensors and sEMG electrodes, a microcontroller unit for data processing, and a mobile application for data visualization and user feedback. To validate the system's effectiveness, the study involved 65 eligible undergraduate students wearing the device, collecting sEMG signals under different posture conditions, and conducting posture analysis to evaluate the device's performance. The results showed a significant correlation between asymmetric paraspinal muscle activity and the direction of the spinal curve, with the system achieving an accuracy rate of 90.8% in predicting the curve direction using a logistic regression model. Although the system verifies spinal alignment through indirect measurement rather than direct imaging, the high consistency between sEMG asymmetry and expected biomechanical patterns supports its reliability as a functional screening tool. Wearable devices can provide timely posture correction reminders and personalized rehabilitation plans, offering a noninvasive, user-friendly solution for the prevention and rehabilitation of spinal curvature abnormalities.",Huang H; Gong W; Chen Z; Mei F; Deng J; Wu N; Hong C; Qiu S; Zhao X,"Fifth Clinical Medical College, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.",Science progress,2025-10-28,10.1177/00368504251387233,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Sensors; Rehabilitation; Correction; Scoliosis; Wearable; Hunchback
41145630,Intelligent monitoring system for quality of life of colostomy patients based on deep learning and AR.,"The clinical challenges in monitoring high-incidence complications in patients with colostomy after colorectal cancer surgery have led to the development of an intelligent monitoring system based on deep learning and augmented reality technology in this study. Traditional care relies on subjective scales for assessment, which has issues such as insufficient sensitivity and delayed response. The existing technical systems also have significant limitations in perception dimensions, environmental adaptability, and decision-making timeliness. Therefore, this study proposes a triple-technology integration solution: by fusing impedance sensing, pH-responsive hydrogels, and 3D depth cameras in a heterogeneous manner, a multi-modal perception network is established to achieve the collaborative collection of physiological and biochemical parameters and morphological features; a cross-modal spatio-temporal fusion network is designed, using dynamic attention mechanisms and differential manifold optimization algorithms to solve the feature coupling problem caused by the heterogeneity of multi-source data; an augmented reality visualization system is developed, combining spatial projection optimization and programmable haptic feedback to build a ""visual-tactile-spatial"" multi-dimensional human-machine interaction channel. The system was verified through multi-center randomized controlled trials, confirming its significant improvement in the early warning performance of complications, enhancement of the standardization of nursing operations, and reduction of medical resource consumption. The core innovation lies in the first introduction of the federated learning framework into the field of colostomy care, combined with neural architecture search for lightweight model deployment, and the quantification of health economic benefits through Markov models. This research marks a paradigm shift in postoperative care from experience-driven to data-driven, providing an extensible technical model for the intelligent monitoring of chronic diseases.

41174145,IoT integrated CNN framework for automated detection and quantification of rice and potato crop diseases.,"In modern precision agriculture, early and accurate identification of crop diseases is crucial for reducing yield loss and minimizing pesticide overuse. This study proposes an IoT-enabled framework that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with image processing techniques for automated classification and quantification of diseases in rice and potato crops. A custom-curated dataset was developed, comprising over 1,800 images acquired through smartphone cameras and foldscope devices under natural lighting conditions. The proposed CNN model achieved a classification accuracy of over 95%, with a disease quantification accuracy of 90.5%, calculated using pixel-level segmentation of infected regions. Experimental results revealed infection percentages ranging from 0.68% in early-stage cases to 13.98% in severely affected samples, enabling precise disease severity analysis. The framework includes a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time visualization of classification results and severity scores. Training convergence was demonstrated with a mini-batch loss reduction from 1.0879 to 0.0094 over 200 iterations, and classification confidence scores exceeding 90% for most disease categories. In addition to software implementation, the model was synthesized for hardware deployment using FPGA, demonstrating less than 5% LUT and 1% register usage for 512 × 512 images, ensuring resource-efficient performance in IoT environments.

41171683,Deep Residual Compensation Model for Unsupervised PET Partial Volume Correction.,"Partial volume effect (PVE) arises from the limited spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, causing significant quantitative biases that hinder accurate metabolic activity assessment. To address these problems, we proposed an unsupervised deep residual compensation model (U-DRCM) for PET partial volume correction (PVC). U-DRCM first predicted an initial blur kernel for the PVE-affected PET image based on a conditional blind deconvolution module (CBD module). Then, a conditional residual compensation module (CRC module) was introduced to compensate for the error caused by inaccurate blur kernel prediction. The whole model is unsupervised which only needs a single patient's PET image as the training label and the corresponding MR image as the network input. The performance of U-DRCM was evaluated against several established PVC approaches, including Richardson-Lucy (RL), reblurred Van-Cittert (RVC), iterative Yang (IY), neural blind deconvolution (NBD), and deep convolutional neural network (DeepPVC) using both simulated BrainWeb phantom and real clinical datasets. In the simulation study, U-DRCM consistently outperformed competing methods across multiple quantitative metrics, achieved a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), an improved structural similarity index (SSIM), and a lower root mean square error (RMSE). For the real clinical study, U-DRCM delivered substantial improvements in standardized uptake value (SUV) and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) across various brain volumes of interest (VOIs). Experimental results show that U-DRCM effectively mitigates the impact of PVE, resulting in high-quality PVC PET images with enhanced brain visualization.",Cui J; Wu J; Wu Z; He J; Zeng Q; Chen Z; Feng Y,,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2025-10-31,10.1109/tmi.2025.3627516,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

Nevertheless, achieving precise root apex location and resection can pose significant challenges for surgeons, particularly in complex anatomical situations. The inherent difficulties in accessing and the restricted visualization typically render EMS infeasible in the second molar region. The autonomous robotic (ATR) system, characterized by its automation, precision, and stability, is anticipated to address the limitations inherent in manual operations within complex EMS scenarios. Herein, this report details the successful application of robot-assisted EMS in a maxillary second molar.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 26-year-old female patient presented to our hospital with chronic periapical periodontitis following a previous history of root canal treatment in the left maxillary second molar. The patient data were imported into DentalNavi software to design the drilling path for precise resection while avoiding damage to the maxillary sinus. Through the integration of an optical pose tracking mechanism and the computerized operational system, the robotic arm completed the autonomous resection task of the mesiobuccal root according to the preoperative plan, providing a position reference for the freehand operation of the distobuccal root. No complications were reported during the surgery. Clinical and radiographic assessments at a six-month follow-up indicated satisfactory outcomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The ATR system offers an accurate, safe, and minimally invasive technique for osteotomy and apicoectomy.

Reinfection after prosthesis removal and antibiotic bone cement spacer implantation is one of the reasons for the failure of two-stage arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors predicting the reinfection in periprosthetic joint infection with sinus tracts following prosthesis removal and antibiotic bone cement spacer implantation.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical data of 35 periprosthetic joint infection patients with sinus tract from February 2003 to December 2021 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Follow-up was discontinued either (1) when patients developed reinfection before completing the second stage of the two-stage revision or (2) when patients were free of infection 2-years postoperatively, regardless of whether they had completed the two-stage revision. The sinus tract is defined as an abnormal channel with evidence of communication to the joint or visualization of the prosthesis. Postoperative reinfection was defined as meeting the diagnostic criteria for periprosthetic joint infection, including requiring hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics or surgeries to prevent infection. The Multifactor Cox proportional risk model was used to analyze the risk factors.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 35 patients, 14 (40.0%) of periprosthetic joint infection patients with one or more sinus tracts developed reinfection after removal of prostheses and implantation of antibiotic bone cement spacers. Multivariate analysis showed that age (p = 0.044), C-reactive protein (p = 0.023) and uric acid (p = 0.025) were independent risk factors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We found the following factors associated with reinfection in periprosthetic joint infection with sinus tracts following prosthesis removal and antibiotic bone cement spacer implantation: age, C-reactive protein and uric acid.",Zeng J; Zhu J; Peng B; Zhang C; Zeng Y,"The First Clinical Medical School of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Jichang Road 12#, District Baiyun, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.",BMC infectious diseases,2025-10-28,10.1186/s12879-025-11849-8,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Risk factor; Arthroplasty; Sinus Tract; Periprosthetic Joint Infection; Antibiotic Bone Cement Spacer

Recent development in technology seems to have potential in assistance in pre-surgical planning, by providing patient-specific physical models of complex anatomy. To date, the application of 3D-printed models for craniopagus twinning separation has not been reported in Saudi Arabia or in the wider Middle East.<h4>Objective</h4>This descriptive study describes the process and establishes the use of 3D-printed anatomical surgical models for the pre-surgical planning of three recent cases of craniopagus twin separation performed at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. These models are the first of their kind in the country and are a major milestone in neurosurgical planning.<h4>Methods</h4>High-resolution MRI and CTA imaging data were collected for three cases of craniopagus twins. The imaging data were segmented and processed to create 3D models of the skull, brain, and shared vasculature using specialized software. Multi-material 3D printing was then employed to produce physical models that accurately represented different anatomical structures, allowing for enhanced distinction and visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Three sets of 3D-printed models were successfully developed. The 3D-printed models provided an accurate and detailed representation of the shared anatomy, allowing the surgical team to visualize and manipulate the complex cranial fusion points and vascular connections. The models were particularly valuable in reducing intraoperative uncertainty and mitigating the risk of complications. This is the first documented use of 3D printing for craniopagus twin separation in Saudi Arabia.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As the first such application in the region, this study paves the way for broader use of 3D printing in complex neurosurgical cases across Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.

41146526,Activity-Triggered Chemiluminescent Probe for α-L-Fucosidase Detection from In Vitro to In Vivo.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most prevalent malignancies with high mortality, necessitates early intervention and prognostic monitoring to improve patient survival. However, the lack of ideal detection methods remains a critical challenge. α-L-Fucosidase (AFU), a key lysosomal hydrolase, has emerged as a promising biomarker for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis. Herein, we developed a chemiluminescent probe (<b>AFU-CL</b>) capable of specifically responding to AFU. <b>AFU-CL</b> enables rapid and highly selective AFU detection, exhibiting exceptional sensitivity (limit of detection = 4.87 × 10<sup>-4</sup> mU/mL) and superior signal-to-noise ratios compared to conventional fluorescent probes. At the cellular level, AFU-CL enabled real-time visualization of endogenous AFU activity in cultured HCC cells (MHCC-97H), demonstrating distinct signal patterns between malignant and normal hepatocytes (MIHA). Progressing to in vivo imaging, the probe successfully achieved in situ visualization of tumor sites in HCC-bearing mouse models, with its specific chemiluminescent signals clearly distinguishing tumor tissues from normal tissues. Most significantly, this detection capability was effectively translated to clinical applications, as AFU-CL-based analysis reliably differentiated serum samples from HCC patients and healthy controls, confirming the probe's potential for clinical diagnosis. This strategy provides a promising platform for early HCC diagnosis and elucidating the functional role of AFU in cancer progression.",Xu L; Liang E; Tan L; Che T; Zhi S; Cheng K,"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of New Drug Screening, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for New Drug Screening, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Key Laboratory of Infectious Diseases Research in South China, Ministry of Education, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China.",Analytical chemistry,2025-10-27,10.1021/acs.analchem.5c04001,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41101332,Design of a fisheye arthroscope with an ultra-wide field of view for viewing joints.,"The field of view (FOV) is a critical parameter in optical endoscopic systems that directly influences a physician's ability to inspect internal anatomical structures thoroughly and accurately without repositioning the device. This study designs and optimizes a rigid arthroscope equipped with a fisheye lens to achieve an ultra-wide 200° field of view, thereby enhancing joint visualization. The fisheye lens is specifically redesigned and optimized to function as the objective lens, and a gradient-index (GRIN) rod is employed to relay the image from the objective to the eyepiece. The device is optimized for the short working distances of arthroscopy, while its ~0.7-500 mm refocusing range (via minor eyepiece adjustment) also makes it adaptable to endoscopic applications that require longer working distances. Image-quality metrics are used to evaluate aberrations, particularly those caused by the increased viewing angle. While wide viewing angles typically amplify off-axis aberrations, the optimized design reduces and balances these residuals to preserve high image quality, and its performance is benchmarked against a high-definition arthroscope featuring a 70° field of view. Overall, the fisheye arthroscope achieves a substantially wider field of view, with aberrations deliberately balanced so that RMS spot sizes remain below the Airy disk, thereby enhancing visualization during clinical joint examinations.",Fahim S; Rezaei-Latifi A; Latifi AR,"Department of Physics, Faculty of Sciences, University of Hormozgan, Bandar Abbas, Iran.",Biomedical physics & engineering express,2025-10-29,10.1088/2057-1976/ae1400,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Joints; Field Of View; Relay; Grin Lens; Fisheye Arthroscope; Rms Radius
41172293,Dual-Targeting Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Simultaneous Mitochondrial Injury Assessment and Fibrosis Monitoring in Pulmonary Fibrosis.,"Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are pivotal organelles that maintain cellular homeostasis; their dysfunction initiates pathological cascades associated with both fibrosis and oncogenesis. Bleomycin (BLM), a widely utilized anticancer drug, inhibits tumor growth by inducing DNA damage. However, its clinical application is constrained by severe pulmonary toxicity. Here, we develop a novel fluorescent probe, <b>BDSTI</b>. In contrast to existing probes that target a single organelle, <b>BDSTI</b> allows for efficient colocalization of mitochondria and ER, facilitating the synchronous observation of their interactions. It also exhibits the capability to detect intracellular polarity and viscosity dynamics induced by BLM concentration gradients. BLM disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential and triggers the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). High-resolution imaging further confirms its role in inducing mitochondrial morphological abnormalities. Notably, <b>BDSTI</b> enables the visualization of BLM-induced lung injury through <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> imaging of pulmonary fibrosis models in tumor-bearing mice. Notably, <b>BDSTI</b> enables visualization of BLM-induced lung injury through <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> imaging of pulmonary fibrosis models in tumor-bearing mice.

41052938,Advantages of 12° Endoscope in Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic Surgery for Lumbar Disc Herniation.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study introduces the application of a 12° endoscope in unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) decompression surgery for lumbar disc herniation and discusses its advantages in UBE procedures.<h4>Methods</h4>From December 2019 to December 2020, 75 patients (33 men and 42 women) were treated with UBE decompression using a 12° endoscope. Patient ages ranged from 26 to 78 years (mean 53.2). Pre- and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for low back and leg pain were recorded. Surgical outcomes were evaluated using MacNab criteria, with operative time and complications documented.<h4>Results</h4>The 12° endoscope demonstrated superior maneuverability with a distortion-free visual field. Compared with 30° endoscopes, it showed better applicability within the anatomical working triangle while providing broader visualization than 0° endoscopes. This enabled effective decompression of the superior articular process medial edge, nerve root canal, and lateral recess. Low back pain VAS scores decreased from 7.3 ± 1.3 to 1.9 ± 1.2 (<i>P</i> < 0.001), while leg pain scores improved from 8.1 ± 1.8 to 1.6 ± 1.0 (<i>P</i> < 0.001). At the 12-month follow-up, MacNab criteria outcomes were excellent in 65.3%, good in 25.3%, and unsatisfactory in 9.3% of cases (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> test, <i>P</i> = 0.002).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The 12° endoscope demonstrates clinical value as a feasible, safe, and effective option for UBE surgery in lumbar disc herniation treatment.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Key clinical advantages of the 12° endoscope include direct visualization of key anatomical structures, minimized bone resection (particularly at the medial spinous process base), and a reduction in instrument crowding. These technical benefits contribute to effective decompression, improved patient outcomes (as measured by VAS and MacNab criteria), and potentially a shorter learning curve for surgeons adopting the UBE technique.<h4>Level of evidence: 3</h4>",Wu W; Xie Y; Xue Y; Cui M; Zeng X; Zhang Y; Yang C; Wu Y,"Department of Orthopedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",International journal of spine surgery,2025-10-27,10.14444/8771,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Lumbar disc herniation; Minimally Invasive Spinal Surgery; Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy; 12° Endoscope
41171746,Micro-Computed Tomography as a complementary tool for histopathological diagnosis of oral soft tissue lesions - Proof of concept.,"<h4>Background</h4>Accurate diagnosis of oral soft tissue lesions is critical for effective treatment, yet conventional histopathological examination, the gold standard, faces limitations. These include two-dimensional (2D) visualization and malorientation, which can obscure critical diagnostic features, like epithelial-connective tissue interfaces. Micro-computed tomography (µCT) offers a non-destructive, high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging alternative to address these challenges. Still, its use for soft tissue visualization is limited. We tested a method with specific radio-opaque staining and µCT scanning settings to visualize oral soft tissue biopsies as a proof of concept.<h4>Methods</h4>Biopsies from 12 patients with different oral mucosa lesions were stained with Lugol's iodine, scanned at 3µm resolution with 70kV energy, and the resulting volumes were compared to histopathological sections by specialists in oral radiology and oral pathology.<h4>Results</h4>µCT produced 2D images with tissue architecture comparable to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections, distinguishing epithelium, connective tissue, and keratin, while 3D reconstructions revealed topographic details, such as ulceration depth and vascular patterns, unattainable in histopathology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings highlight µCT potential as a complementary diagnostic tool, enhancing topographic rendering while preserving tissue integrity. Standardized protocols and broader validation, particularly for precancerous and malignant lesions, are essential for clinical adoption, promising improved diagnostic accuracy in oral pathology.",Kats L; Gabet Y; Shpunt U; Vered M,"Department of Oral Pathology, Oral Medicine and Maxillofacial Imaging, Goldschleger School of Dental Medicine, Gray Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.",PloS one,2025-10-31,10.1371/journal.pone.0335602,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41161323,Single-Use versus Reusable Gastroscopes for the initial Assessment of patients with Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: A Prospective Randomised Non-Inferiority Trial.,"<h4>Background and study aims</h4>Recently, several single-use endoscopes have been developed. However, clinical performance remains unclear. This trial aims to compare the performance of single-use gastroscopes (SUG) with that of reusable gastroscopes (RUG), in the context of emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Patients with suspected UGIB requiring EGD between March 2023 and April 2024 were randomized, one of which received EGD with a SUG, the other with a RUG. The primary outcome was the complete assessment of the upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) for the presence of a bleeding site.<h4>Results</h4>148 patients were included between 03/2023 and 04/2024. A complete assessment of the UGIT was achieved in 72 of 74 patients with the SUG and in 71 of 74 patients with the RUG, (97.3% vs. 95.9%; p<0.001), however, the bleeding site was identified significantly more frequently in the reusable group (83.8% vs. 68.9%, p=0.033). The need for a therapeutic intervention did not differ between the groups (55.4% vs. 50.0%, p=0.510). Five crossovers to a RUG occurred, largely due to better visualization and user experience. <b>Conclusions: </b>SUG are non-inferior to RUG in the complete assessment of the UGIT in patients with signs of upper GIB, however, a significantly higher rate of bleeding site identification, superior visualization quality, greater acceptance by endoscopists, and a trend toward more effective therapeutic performance was achieved with RUG.",Römmele C; Ayoub M; Scheppach MW; Muzalyova A; Wanzl J; Tadic V; Braun G; Weber T; Roser D; Nagl S; Messmann H; Ebigbo A,"Gastroenterology, University Hospital Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.",Endoscopy,2025-10-29,10.1055/a-2735-1114,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

Previously, most cases were incidentally detected during surgery or in autopsy specimens. Doppler evaluation may also demonstrate these anomalies; however, the sensitivity is poor due to suboptimal visualization of the entire course. With the advent of multidetector CT angiography, these anomalies are increasingly being detected. Although majority of cases are incidentally detected on scans performed for evaluation of congenital heart defects, these anomalies assume clinical importance when central venous cannulation or pacemaker insertion is contemplated through the anomalous side. Prior knowledge of the anomalous anatomy is also important before cardiothoracic surgeries.

We developed a deep learning model to classify insertion depth during VL as shallow, glottic zone, or deep.<h4>Study design</h4>A deep learning model was trained on 298,955 annotated frames from 132 neonatal VL videos from two NICUs on one platform with fivefold cross-validation. 31 clinicians were surveyed regarding preferred device feedback modalities.<h4>Results</h4>The model detected glottic zone and shallow insertion depths with F1 scores of 0.894 and 0.718, respectively. Deep insertion events were rare (2.7%) with low performance (F1 = 0.034). Most clinicians preferred visual, minimal prompts over voice or haptic feedback.<h4>Conclusion</h4>AI-enabled VL may support blade-insertion depth assessment and training.

41174749,Toward global reproductive justice: a universal framework for evaluating equity and autonomy in in-vitro fertilization policies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Equitable and ethical access to in-vitro fertilization (IVF) remains challenging globally. Existing evaluation frameworks often overlook critical dimensions of reproductive justice. This study develops and validates a Universal IVF Justice Framework, designed to systematically evaluate national IVF policies regarding equity and reproductive autonomy.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic literature review (PubMed, Scopus; January 1, 2010 to June 11, 2025) to identify key policy dimensions and indicators, followed by expert consultations and pilot testing to ensure reliability. The framework was validated through comprehensive document reviews and double-coding of IVF policies from 24 diverse countries. Visualization tools were created to illustrate outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Analysis revealed three overarching dimensions that shape national IVF policy outcomes: economic and structural conditions, cultural and social contexts, and healthcare system factors. Substantial variation emerged across countries. At the micro-level, country-specific analyses exposed targeted strengths and weaknesses, supporting localized reform efforts. Visualizations such as radar and scatter plots highlighted performance disparities. At the macro-level, high-income countries generally scored higher, driven by broader insurance coverage, inclusive legal protections, and greater geographic access. In contrast, low- and middle-income countries often faced challenges in affordability, rural service delivery, LGBTQ+ inclusivity, and psychosocial support.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Universal IVF Justice Framework offers an empirically-grounded and ethically informed approach for evaluating IVF policies globally. By clearly identifying policy strengths and critical gaps, it supports evidence-based decision-making and targeted reforms aimed at enhancing equity and reproductive autonomy in IVF services worldwide.",Qiu RM; Muthakana R; Mao W,"Duke Science & Society, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.",Reproductive health,2025-10-31,10.1186/s12978-025-02172-1,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Global Health; Equity; Autonomy; Women’s Health; Policy Evaluation; Reproductive Justice; Ivf Policy

41152386,Through every lens: assessing the impact of chemical modifications on antibody-conjugates using in vivo imaging.,"Chemical modification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and their fragments gives rise to imaging probes and targeted therapies. Depending on the isotope used, radiolabeled mAbs enable positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and can also be applied as cytotoxic therapies. Fluorescent mAb conjugates are used for a range of preclinical applications with clinical utility for intraoperative visualization of tumors. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) enhance the therapeutic efficacy of mAbs and are the topic of extensive clinical development. In all these cases, chemical modifications can significantly affect mAb tumor targeting and clearance. Whole-body imaging techniques provide crucial insights into the in vivo consequences of these changes by directly tracking antibody conjugate distribution and clearance. This review examines in vivo imaging studies that compare ""parental"" and ""modified"" mAbs imaged under identical conditions to assess the effects of the cargo itself (e.g. fluorophore, chelator, drug), as well as the chemical conjugation methods. Additionally, we also describe studies that evaluate alternative strategies, including pretargeting, Fc modifications and pre- or co-dosing strategies that seek to tune the biodistribution of a given conjugate. Overall, we highlight the critical role of imaging in characterizing the in vivo performance of mAb conjugates, underscoring how these insights can inform both therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, and enable clinical translation.",Edupuganti VVSR; Escorcia FE; Schnermann MJ,"Chemical Biology Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA.",Npj imaging,2025-10-28,10.1038/s44303-025-00109-8,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41162757,Revisiting meniscal anatomical variants of the knee: a high-resolution 7-Tesla MRI study.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To examine anatomical variants of meniscal root insertions among asymptomatic individuals using high-resolution 7-T MRI.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This prospective study, approved by the local ethics committee, involved 57 knees from 48 participants (mean age 31.8 years; 19 females), being examined on a clinical 7-T MRI scanner with sagittal isotropic 0.24 mm 3D double echo steady state (DESS) sequence. Two radiologists identified the number and location of each meniscal root insertion. Two other radiologists repeated this evaluation, noting meniscofemoral ligaments. Inter-rater reliability was calculated.<h4>Results</h4>Majority of the posterior lateral meniscus roots featured double insertions (66.7%), followed by single (31.6%) and triple insertions (1.8%). Single roots mainly inserted into the intercondylar area (77.8%), the remaining into the posterior slope of the posteromedial eminence (22.2%). Double roots typically had a major insertion at the posteromedial aspect of the anterior cruciate ligament and a minor root at the posterior slope of the lateral eminence (78.9%). The remaining roots of both menisci featured only single insertions. Anterior medial roots inserted along the medial tibial edge (71.9%) and into the intercondylar area (28.1%). Inter-rater reliability for describing the posterior lateral meniscal root insertions was perfect (κ = 1), and strong for identifying all insertion sites (κ = 0.808). Meniscofemoral ligaments were prevalent (87.7%) with a broad heterogenous fan-shaped femoral attachment observed using the 3D DESS sequence.<h4>Conclusion</h4>7-T 3D-DESS imaging allows high-resolution visualization of the meniscal roots with excellent inter-rater reliability, highlighting anatomical variability mainly in the posterior root of the lateral meniscus.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Anatomical variations of the number and insertion sites of meniscal roots are documented in anatomical and imaging studies. Findings High-resolution 3D dual-echo steady state on a 7-T MRI facilitates the visualization of the number of roots and their respective osseous insertions for both menisci.

41152940,Preliminary evaluation of mixed reality navigation with single-vertebra registration in spinal surgery.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To develop a mixed reality navigation system based on single-vertebra registration and to preliminarily validate its feasibility in clinical surgery, providing a potential reference for spinal surgical navigation registration methods.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a portable, stand-alone, optical-based mixed reality navigation system for spinal surgery using a head-mounted display. The system integrates registration and real-time localization functions, enabling single-vertebra registration via anatomical landmarks and interactive visualization through the HoloLens 2 platform. System performance was evaluated in both laboratory and clinical settings by measuring localization time, fiducial registration error (FRE), and target registration error (TRE). Preoperative assessments were conducted on patient-specific 3D-printed vertebral models, and intraoperative evaluations were performed on exposed vertebrae during surgery. Additional trials with novice surgeons were performed to assess the learning curve. For selected cases requiring pedicle screw placement, surgeons qualitatively evaluated the intraoperative visualization of preplanned screw trajectories in terms of anatomical congruence, feasibility, and display clarity.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 37 spinal surgery patients were included, covering cervical, thoracic, and lumbar segments. The average preoperative navigation time based on 3D-printed models was 2.96 ± 0.26 min, compared with 3.11 ± 0.25 min intraoperatively (p = 0.002). The FRE was 1.37 ± 0.54 mm preoperatively and 1.42 ± 0.52 mm intraoperatively (p = 0.178). The TRE was 1.52 ± 0.56 mm preoperatively and 1.75 ± 0.61 mm intraoperatively (p = 0.001). Among four pedicle screw placement cases, three were rated satisfactory intraoperatively, and one showed an approximately 5 mm deviation due to minor patient positional changes. The learning curve indicated that procedure time stabilized at approximately 2.7 min after about 15 practice cases.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The single-vertebra registration-based mixed reality navigation system enables rapid and accurate vertebral localization in both preoperative and intraoperative settings, with TREs within clinically acceptable limits. The system is portable, easy to operate, and provides an intuitive, immersive navigation interface without relying on external tracking devices.

41168021,Clinical Applications of Laryngeal Ultrasonography: A Review.,"Laryngeal ultrasonography (LUS) is a modern evolution of ultrasound technology that has advanced considerably since its clinical introduction in the 1970s, offering a noninvasive, radiation-free, and cost-effective imaging technique that is gaining renewed attention for its clinical applications in otolaryngology. Although available for decades, LUS remains underused in routine practice. This contemporary review synthesizes recent advances across five domains: tumor and lesion detection, vocal fold (VF) imaging, swallowing assessment, perioperative and emergency airway evaluation, and pediatric applications. Evidence shows that LUS achieves diagnostic accuracy comparable to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and flexible laryngoscopy for many laryngeal disorders, while offering advantages in accessibility, bedside use, and patient comfort. Studies confirm its high sensitivity and specificity for VF immobility, and show that LUS can provide quantitative markers of dysphagia. In perioperative and emergency care, LUS supports airway screening, intubation confirmation, and postoperative monitoring. In children, it is especially valuable as a safe, noninvasive, and well-tolerated alternative to endoscopy for assessing VF mobility and nodules. Limitations include reduced visualization in calcified cartilage or obesity, signal attenuation with increasing depth, operator dependence, and incomplete evaluation of the oral and esophageal phases of swallowing. Despite these challenges, technological refinements and growing clinical experience continue to broaden its role. LUS is a versatile imaging tool with the potential to complement, and in selected cases replace, more invasive or resource-intensive methods in otolaryngology.",Holm JR; Prosser BD; Jiang JJ,"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,2025-10-29,10.1016/j.jvoice.2025.10.014,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Computed tomography (CT); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Laryngeal Ultrasonography (Lus); Laryngoscopy: Perioperative Monitoring; Vocal Fold (Vf)
41160389,The role of capsule endoscopy in Crohn's disease.,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by heterogeneous manifestations with significant morbidities. Diagnosing and managing CD remains challenging due to its variable clinical presentation, complexities in assessing disease extent and activity, and lack of a definitive diagnostic marker. Over the last years, there has been a switch towards a treat-to-target approach in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Capsule endoscopy (CE) has emerged as a non-invasive, complementary tool for CD diagnosis and monitoring. CE is patient friendly being wireless and enables direct visualization of the entire small bowel in one sitting. CE plays a role in the diagnostic workup of suspected CD and in cases of in IBD unclassified (IBDU). In established CD, CE plays a role in monitoring mucosal healing, a key therapeutic target linked to improved long-term outcomes. CE findings significantly influence treatment strategies, leading to therapy escalation, adjustment, or avoidance of unnecessary surgical interventions. Moreover, CE disease activity assessment by means of the Lewis score is able to predict disease flares, thus having also a prognostic role. In conclusion, the non-invasive nature of CE, combined with its diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications, establishes it as an essential tool in the comprehensive management of CD across all disease stages. This review provides a comprehensive update on CE's evolving role in optimizing care of patients with CD.",Nandi N; Becq A; Michelon M; Sidhu R,"Academic Unit of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK - nicoletta.nandi@nhs.net.",Minerva gastroenterology,2025-10-29,10.23736/s2724-5985.25.03867-7,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41174252,Post mortem laboratory detection of Helicobacter spp. in swine.,"Gastric ulcers in pigs are a major health issue, reducing productivity and welfare. Colonization of the gastric mucosa by Helicobacter spp., particularly Helicobacter suis, is considered a potential etiological factor. This study evaluated the prevalence of gastric lesions and compared three diagnostic methods -impression cytology, urease test, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time PCR) for detecting Helicobacter spp. in pigs. Post mortem samples were collected from 137 slaughtered pigs, with three mucosal samples per stomach (fundus, pylorus, pars oesophagea), totaling 411. A subset of 20 samples, representing all stomach regions and diverse cytology/urease outcomes, was analyzed by Real-Time PCR targeting H. suis and H. pylori (ureA and 16 S rRNA genes). Macroscopic evaluation frequently revealed ulcerative or pre-ulcerative changes. The highest detection rates occurred in the fundic region (66% by cytology; 45% by urease test), supporting preferential colonization of glandular mucosa. Bacterial presence was also observed in the pars oesophagea, suggesting colonization varies with anatomical site and lesion severity. Real-Time PCR detected H. suis in 80% and H. pylori in 20% of samples, confirming its superior sensitivity and ability to differentiate species, which conventional tests cannot provide. Cytology enabled direct visualization of spiral-shaped bacteria, while the urease test was useful mainly at higher bacterial loads. In conclusion, combining macroscopic scoring with cytology, urease testing, and PCR allows comprehensive assessment of gastric lesions and Helicobacter infection. These results highlight the diagnostic advantages of molecular methods and the value of integrated approaches for surveillance and management of gastric disease in swine production.",Krepelková Z; Karaffová V; Bárdová K; Andrašková S; Novotný J,"Clinic of Swine, University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy, Komenského 73, Košice, 04181, Slovakia.",Veterinary research communications,2025-11-01,10.1007/s11259-025-10961-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Swine; Real-Time PCR; Gastric Lesions; Impression Cytology; Urease Test; Helicobacter Spp.
41146410,Successful Treatment with a 6.3-Fr Disposable Digital Flexible Ureteroscope and Holmium Laser Lithotripsy in a 50-Year-Old Man with Large Bilateral Ureteral Stones and Hydronephrosis.,"BACKGROUND This report describes a 50-year-old man with large bilateral ureteral stones and hydronephrosis. Bilateral impacted large ureteral stones present significant clinical challenges and can lead to serious complications, such as hydronephrosis, urinary tract infections, and renal function impairment. Due to their size and location, treatment often requires advanced techniques and specialized equipment to achieve optimal outcomes while minimizing complications. In the present case, use of the smallest 6.3-Fr flexible ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy effectively managed the condition, demonstrating its utility in treating complex ureteral stones. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old man received a diagnosis of bilateral impacted ureteral stones. The right ureteral stone measured 22×10×10 mm, and the left stone was 11×10×8 mm, accompanied by hydronephrosis. After antibiotic therapy, flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy was performed using a 6.3-Fr disposable digital flexible ureteroscope. Holmium laser fragmentation was followed by stone fragment retrieval using a vacuum-assisted ureteral access sheath. Postoperative computed tomography confirmed complete stone clearance and significant improvement in hydronephrosis. The patient had an uneventful recovery without significant complications. CONCLUSIONS The 6.3-Fr disposable flexible ureteroscope is highly effective for large impacted ureteral stones. Its small diameter minimizes ureteral trauma, enhances irrigation, and provides superior visualization. The vacuum-assisted ureteral access sheath facilitates efficient stone retrieval, reducing operative time and complications. This case highlights the potential advantages of the 6.3-Fr ureteroscope in treating complex urolithiasis, especially in patients with challenging anatomical conditions.

41145786,Photon-counting CT outperforms dental CBCT in detecting small accessory canals in root-filled teeth in a phantom study.,"Accurate visualization of dental structures in root-filled teeth is critical for endodontic assessment but challenging due to artifacts from root canal (RC) fillings. This study compares photon-counting-detector CT (PCD-CT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) for detecting small accessory canals in the presence of RC fillings. A phantom model with four bovine teeth containing RC fillings and five artificial accessory canals (1000-200 μm) per tooth was embedded in a bovine rib. The phantom was scanned with clinical PCD-CT (ultra-high-resolution protocol) and dental CBCT (endodontic protocol). Canal visibility was evaluated using signal-to-noise criteria, and canal diameters were compared with micro-CT measurements, serving as the reference. Blooming artifacts from RC fillings were quantified using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of attenuation profiles. PCD-CT detected all canals down to 400 μm and 81.5% at 200 μm, while CBCT reliably detected canals ≥ 800 μm, with detection dropping to 47.2% at 400 μm and none at 200 μm. Measurement errors for canal diameters were lower with PCD-CT. Artifact widths varied between modalities, with no clear superiority. PCD-CT provided higher detectability and measurement fidelity for small accessory canals in root-filled teeth compared to a dental CBCT, with similar filling-related blooming, supporting the potential of PCD-CT in post-treatment endodontic imaging.",Rau S; Rau A; Lang F; Fink A; Weiß J; Kellner E; Bamberg F; Jung BA; Schmelzeisen R; Pichotka M; Altenburger M; Russe MF; Semper-Hogg W,"Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Str. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany. stephan.rau@uniklinik-freiburg.de.",Scientific reports,2025-10-27,10.1038/s41598-025-24439-0,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Tomography; X-ray computed; Cbct; Photon-counting Detectors; Photon-counting Ct
41176564,Indocyanine green fluorescence in parathyroidectomy: enhancing efficiency through real-time adenoma identification.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Intraoperative identification of parathyroid adenomas can be challenging due to their anatomical variability and the limitations of preoperative imaging. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging on operative efficiency and surgical outcomes in parathyroidectomy, employing a standard near-infrared (NIR) endoscopic system.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a prospective interventional study with retrospective controls. Patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism were included. The study group received intravenous ICG for intraoperative fluorescence imaging to aid parathyroid gland identification. Standard protocols, including preoperative imaging, intraoperative quick parathyroid hormone (qPTH) measurements, and frozen section analysis, were followed in both groups. Operative times and clinical outcomes were compared between ICG-assisted and standard procedures.<h4>Results</h4>Seventy-six patients were included: 19 in the ICG group and 57 in the control group. The median net operative time (cutting-to-end) was significantly shorter in the ICG group (59 vs. 79 min; p = 0.002), while entry-to-cutting time was slightly longer (44 vs. 35 min; p = 0.014). Although the total operative time was shorter in the ICG group (109 vs. 123 min), this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.060). A ≥ 50% reduction in qPTH was achieved in 94.7% vs. 89.5% (p = 0.672), and adenoma confirmation was 100% vs. 96.5% (p = 1.0), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ICG fluorescence is a cost-effective adjunct to standard parathyroidectomy, offering real-time gland visualization and potentially reducing operative times. Its integration into the routine surgical workflow may enhance intraoperative efficiency and outcomes.",Mizrakli Y; Hirschfeld Z; Pitaro J; Gavriel H; Muallem-Kalmovich L,"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Shamir Medical Center (formerly Assaf Harofeh Medical Center), Zerifin, Israel. mizrakli@tauex.tau.ac.il.",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,2025-11-01,10.1007/s00405-025-09679-0,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),"Hyperparathyroidism; Parathyroid adenoma; Parathyroidectomy; Intraoperative Imaging; Near-infrared (Nir) Imaging; Indocyanine Green (Icg),"
40328243,Contrast Agent-Specific Parameter Optimization for T 1 -Weighted Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo Imaging : Use Cases for Gadoterate Meglumine and Gadobutrol at 1.5T and 3.0T.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study is to derive a contrast agent-specific theoretical framework to optimize acquisition parameters for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the physiochemical properties of gadolinium-based contrast agents, focusing on fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences. The goal is to enhance the lesion-to-background contrast for improved diagnostic sensitivity in clinical applications.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Signal equations for fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences were derived for nonenhancing and enhancing tissues using gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol, characterized by distinct longitudinal (r 1 ) and transverse (r 2 /r* 2 ) relaxivities. Simulations were conducted at 2 field strengths, 1.5T and 3.0T, and various scenarios were considered, including hypothetical lesions with T 1 ratios ranging from 1.1 to 1.8. The signal behavior was analyzed across a range of initial conditions, including different spin densities and field-strength dependent variations in tissue relaxation times. The optimal flip angle and repetition time combinations were determined to maximize contrast. In vivo validation was performed on 2 patients undergoing contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain, using the proposed acquisition parameters.<h4>Results</h4>The modeling and simulations revealed that the flip angle that maximizes signal intensity for a contrast-enhancing lesion (Ernst angle) differs from the flip angle that maximizes T 1 -dependent contrast between lesion and healthy tissue in unenhanced MRI (Pelc angle) and also differs from the flip angle that maximizes the same in contrast-enhanced MRI. The theoretical simulations indicated possible contrast gains of 24%-28% using optimized parameters. The in vivo acquisitions demonstrated contrast gains of 19%-44% for a diffuse enhancing lesion and 91% for a weakly enhancing focal lesion, when comparing the optimized acquisition parameters to manufacturer's default settings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Adjusted repetition time and flip angle values, derived using the proposed framework, improved the image contrast between healthy and diseased tissues, enhancing the visualization of abnormalities. This approach can be used to optimize routine clinical MRI protocols and balance scan time with contrast enhancement. This may translate to more precise lesion detection, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis or treatment monitoring in clinical practice.",Gkotsis DE; Bherwani A; Kapsalaki EZ; Bishop CJ; Schwarz AJ,"GE HealthCare, Pharmaceutical Diagnostics, London, United Kingdom (D.E.G., A.B., C.J.B., A.J.S.); Radiology Department, Diagnostic Center Euromedica, Athens, Greece (E.Z.K.); and Department of Radiology, University of Thessaly, School of Medicine, Larissa, Greece (E.Z.K.).",Investigative radiology,2025-11-01,10.1097/rli.0000000000001205,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Parameter optimization; Contrast-enhanced Mri; Gadolinium-based Contrast Agents; Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo Imaging
41152881,Interaction effect of age and axial length-to-corneal radius ratio on myopia in children and adolescents: a cross-sectional study in China.,"<h4>Background</h4>Myopia has emerged as a significant public health concern in China. Despite age and axial length-to-corneal radius ratio (AL/CR) being widely recognized as independent factors influencing myopia in children and adolescents, very few studies have investigated the combined effects of these two factors or the extent of their interaction. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the association and interaction between age and AL/CR and the prevalence of myopia in children and adolescents, providing evidence for early myopia prevention and control.<h4>Methods</h4>In 2022, three primary schools in Shenzhen were selected via random cluster sampling. Students who had lived in Shenzhen for over 6 months were administered surveys, and underwent myopia screenings (visual acuity and noncycloplegic autorefraction) and ocular biometric measurements. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the interaction between age and AL/CR using both multiplicative and additive models. A generalized additive model was used to evaluate the relationship among age, AL/CR, and myopia prevalence, with the results presented through visualization analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3,220 participants were included (mean age of 8.95 ± 1.77 years; mean AL/CR ratio of 3.01 ± 0.13). The overall prevalence of myopia was 47.67%. After adjusting for sex, parental myopia, reading and writing posture, per capita monthly income, and anterior chamber depth, a significant multiplicative interaction between age and AL/CR on myopia prevalence (OR = 2.147, 95% CI 1.553-2.968) was observed. Additive interaction analysis further revealed a relative excess risk due to interaction of 10.816 (95% CI 8.027-13.605), an attributable proportion of 0.700 (95% CI 0.636-0.763), and a synergy index of 3.971 (95% CI 3.065-5.143).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The interaction between age and AL/CR was associated with a greater likelihood of myopia, with both positive multiplicative and additive effects observed. Older age and increased AL/CR ratios were associated with a greater likelihood of myopia in children and adolescents, emphasizing the importance of early prevention strategies.",Mu J; Zhong H; Zhu H; Jiang M,"Shenzhen Eye Hospital, Shenzhen Eye Medical Center, Southern Medical University, No.18 Zetian Road, Shenzhen, 518040, Guangdong, China. 1014120300@qq.com.",Journal of translational medicine,2025-10-28,10.1186/s12967-025-07190-y,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Age; Myopia; Generalized Additive Model; Additive Interaction; Multiplicative Interaction; Axial Length-to-corneal Radius Ratio
41172270,"Distinguishing Fractures in Posterior Distal Tibia and Ankle: A Review of Posterior Malleolar, Pilon, and Pilon-Variant Definitions and Treatments.","» Inconsistent terminology and overlapping definitions for posterior distal tibia/ankle fractures (posterior malleolar, pilon-variant, posterior pilon) hinder standardized care and outcomes. This study critically evaluates classifications and treatments, proposing clear definitions based on fragment morphology, articular involvement, and biomechanics:» 1. Posterior malleolar fractures: Involve the non-weight-bearing posterior tibial margin, typically from rotational injuries. Nonoperative management suffices if the syndesmosis is stable (smaller fragments). In the case of an unstable syndesmosis, surgical fixation by a posterolateral (PL) approach is recommended for direct visualization, reduction, and stable fixation, although this may vary case by case.» 2. Posterior pilon-variant fractures: Intermediate severity, affecting the posteromedial (PM) tibia and partially compromising the weight-bearing surface. Characterized by large PM fragments. Fixation by a PM approach is recommended, promoting faster union and reducing neurovascular risk compared with PL, although this is ultimately up to the surgeon's preference.» 3. Posterior pilon fractures: Involve disruption of the weight-bearing articular surface with posterior plafond extension, resulting from high-energy axial compression (e.g., falls). Features include comminution, articular impaction, and potential involvement of posterior/medial columns, resembling classic pilon but posteriorly localized. Severe soft-tissue damage necessitates staged management: initial external fixation followed by definitive internal fixation. Addressing comminuted fragments requires a combined PL and PM approach. For a large fragment with no comminution, minimally invasive anterior cannulated screws can be used.» This taxonomy directly links fracture patterns to surgical urgency (nonoperative, single-stage, staged), fixation strategies (approach selection-PL, PM, or combined), and prognostic implications. By integrating anatomical precision with clinical practicality, the framework resolves current terminology disparities, enhances diagnostic reproducibility, and aims to improve outcomes for these complex injuries.",Sanford CG; Cho T; Yoon KW; Gadangi P; Liu J,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Toledo Medical Center, Toledo, Ohio.",JBJS reviews,2025-10-27,10.2106/jbjs.rvw.25.00048,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41152477,Comparative Analysis of Image Quality of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography in Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease in Sedated vs. Non-sedated Patients: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.,"To evaluate the impact of sedation on image quality in cardiovascular computed tomography (CCT) in congenital heart disease (CHD). CCT plays an important role in CHD assessment. CCT image quality can be compromised by 'patient-based' artifacts, and sedation is thought to minimize these. ""Optimal"" quality must be carefully considered given the risk of neurodevelopmental delay from cumulative effect of sedation. This was a single-center retrospective study of all consecutive CHD CCT scans performed on pediatric patients (< 12 years). Patients were categorized into three subgroups based on age and four subgroups based on CCT indication. Image analysis was scored by blinded raters using a 4-point Likert scale for image quality, visualization of structure in question, and reporting of elements of diagnosis. Additionally, the raters commented if scan is of diagnostic quality. The study was reported of diagnostic quality if it answered the clinical question. Interobserver analysis was conducted in a subgroup of 100 cases. A total of 291 congenital CCT scans were reviewed, of which 154 met inclusion criteria (age range 0.03-11.6 years; 63% male), including 83 sedated scans. Diagnostic quality was comparable between sedated and non-sedated scans in the overall cohort (94% vs. 99%, p = 0.2), as well as across age and indication subgroups, despite differences in certain image quality parameters. The mean dose length product (DLP) was 25.1 ± 33.6 mGy·cm in the sedated group and 24.8 ± 36.5 mGy·cm in the non-sedated group, with no significant differences across age subgroups (< 2 months: p = 0.2; 2months-4 years: p = 0.6; 4-12 years: p > 0.9). Inter-rater reliability analysis demonstrated good to excellent agreement. Our study demonstrates overall high diagnostic quality of CCT in children with CHD, with no significant difference between sedated and non-sedated groups, despite the presence of artifacts. Radiation dose burden was also comparable between the two groups. Future multicenter studies with larger sample sizes and varied scanner platforms are needed to validate and expand upon these findings.",Alloah Q; Cheong D; Jhaveri S; Glover K; Kwon EN; Rajagopal HG,"Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Cohen Children's Medical Center, Northwell, NY, USA. qalloah@unmc.edu.",Pediatric cardiology,2025-10-28,10.1007/s00246-025-04051-9,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Congenital heart disease; Sedation; Image Quality; Cardiovascular Computed Tomography; Pediatric Imaging
41168395,First-in-human study of a novel bifunctional PET tracer [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 targeting FAP and hypoxia.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Preclinical studies have demonstrated that [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga/[<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04, a bivalent agent containing an extra hypoxia-sensitive 2-nitroimidazole (NI) group, exhibited favorable tumor binding affinity and improved tumor uptake and retention than [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga/[<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-DOTA-FAPI-04. This study aims to further investigate the value of clinical application for [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 PET/CT via a direct head-to-head comparison with [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 50 patients underwent paired [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT within 1 week interval. Among these, four patients underwent serial dynamic [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 PET scans for dosimetry evaluation, and the others underwent scans at 60 min and 120 min. Additionally, we calculated the SUV<sub>max</sub> differences (ΔSUV<sub>max</sub>) by [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 minus [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT for further analysis. Immunohistochemistry for FAP and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) was performed in 22 primary tumors.<h4>Results</h4>The effective absorbed dose of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 PET/CT was calculated as 1.95E-02 mSv/MBq. Tumor uptake of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 showed rapid uptake and steady values (average SUV<sub>max</sub> 11.6-13.0 from 3 to 120 min). [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 exhibited significantly higher uptake in tumor lesions compared to [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT, particularly in primary tumors (P < 0.05), nodal metastases (P < 0.001), bone metastases (P < 0.001), and liver metastases (P < 0.05). That of FAP expression was correlated with that of HIF-1α (r = 0.661, P < 0.001), and the expression of HIF-1α showed a positive correlation with ΔSUV<sub>max</sub> (r = 0.528, P = 0.011).<h4>Conclusion</h4>[<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 showed significantly higher tumor uptake and retention over [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04, with particularly enhanced visualization of hypoxic lesions, suggesting that hypoxia-sensitive moiety may play an important role in detection of tumors.

41173371,"Application of an ecological approach to assessment of nutrition in school-aged children- a report from the ""Biomarkers of Nutrition for Development: Knowledge Indicating Dietary Sufficiency (BOND-KIDS)"" Project Working Group 3.","The global health community must extend its attention beyond the ""first 1000 days"" to include school-aged children (i.e., the ""next 7000 days"") given the critical windows of development during this period. An opportunity exists to leverage school settings to implement programs for supporting child health and nutrition. Historically, many school-based programs evaluate ""learning"" or academic achievement as a priority outcome, with less attention paid to the ""learner."" This has left gaps in studying the impact school nutrition programs and interventions may have on children's health and development, and how to measure these outcomes. The ""Biomarkers of Nutrition for Development: Knowledge Indicating Dietary Sufficiency (BOND-KIDS)"" Project primarily focused on these gaps - specifically, the need for better tools to measure the functional impact of school-based nutritional interventions on the health and development of school-aged children, ages 5-19 years. Functionally, BOND-KIDS applied an ecological approach via the organization of 4 interacting thematic working groups (WG): 1) Biology (internal environment), 2) Environment (external; home, school, physical), 3) Assessment, 4) Translation and implementation. This report represents the work of WG 3: Assessment, which addresses the specific need for better assessment tools, and also includes general considerations for nutritional assessment in children. We included the evidence, relevance, and feasibility of current approaches in assessing dietary intake, nutritional status, and key functional outcomes for the developing school-aged children. The findings will help to determine context-specific approaches to assess the need for and impact of interventions designed to improve the diet, nutrition, and health of school-aged children.

41166314,Tropistry: A registry-based modular platform to improve care of neglected tropical diseases in nonendemic settings-Study protocol with two targeted conditions: acute schistosomiasis and cutaneous/mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are increasingly encountered in nonendemic settings due to migration, international travel, and global mobility. Their clinical management is often challenging: evidence from endemic regions is limited or not directly applicable, and healthcare providers are frequently unfamiliar with their diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, there is substantial heterogeneity in diagnostic workup, therapeutic choices, and follow-up strategies, which may affect patient outcomes and complicate guideline development. Given the sporadic presentation of these diseases across individual centers and the overall low caseload in nonendemic settings, conducting randomized controlled trials to define optimal strategies is largely unfeasible. To address these gaps, we designed Tropistry, a modular, multicenter registry that integrates harmonized data collection with embedded expert-informed clinical guidance.<h4>Methods</h4>Tropistry is an ambispective, multicenter registry planned for implementation across Belgian and European sites. Its modular structure will allow the sequential integration of disease-specific components, initially focusing on acute schistosomiasis and cutaneous/mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (CL/MCL), selected for their sporadic occurrence, clinical complexity, and lack of standardized management. Data will be collected through REDCap-based electronic case report forms aligned with up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations to ensure harmonized and comparable data collection. Embedded expert-informed guidance will support clinicians unfamiliar with these diseases, complemented by expedited access to ITM experts via TROPmail and aggregated feedback through an interactive R Shiny-based dashboard. A structured evaluation framework will assess feasibility, usability, data quality, user engagement, and treatment adherence to ensure the platform's utility and validity.<h4>Expected impact</h4>By centralizing harmonized data on diagnostic and therapeutic practices, Tropistry aims to address critical knowledge gaps in managing NTDs in nonendemic settings. For the initial targeted conditions, it will help clarify optimal strategies, such as the combination of corticosteroids and praziquantel for acute schistosomiasis and best practices for therapy and follow-up in CL/MCL. Beyond data collection, Tropistry will provide embedded expert-informed guidance, interactive dashboards, and direct access to ITM experts to support clinicians and promote standardized care. Its modular design will enable expansion to other challenging NTDs, while the built-in evaluation framework ensures continuous assessment and optimization of feasibility, usability, and clinical utility. Ultimately, Tropistry seeks to strengthen collaboration between reference centers and non-specialized facilities and generate robust real-world evidence to inform clinical practice, guideline development, and future trials.",Bea-Serrano C; Alcedo S; Berens-Riha N; van Henten S; van Griensven J; Van Den Broucke S; Soentjens P; Gobbi F; Bottieau E,"Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Clinic University Hospital of Valencia, INCLIVA Biomedical Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.",PloS one,2025-10-30,10.1371/journal.pone.0335032,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
41160808,A software framework for infrared spectral analysis in harm reduction drug checking.,"<i>Background:</i> Drug checking is a harm reduction intervention that uses chemical analytical methods to provide information on the composition of illicit drug mixtures.
