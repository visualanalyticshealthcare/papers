41601167,Transforming Trauma Care: Interactive Dashboard Boosts Trauma Center Verification and Performance.,"Managing and analyzing trauma registry data is critical for optimizing trauma care and maintaining verification by organizations such as the American College of Surgeons. However, the volume and complexity of these data can be challenging to hone in on what is important. This study describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an interactive trauma registry dashboard developed for enhancing compliance with trauma center verification standards. Developed using R programming, the dashboard consolidates trauma metrics into a layered, web-based interface featuring interactive visualizations and modular components tailored to performance improvement and compliance tracking. The primary data source is the trauma registry, with optional integration of external files. Implementation of the dashboard streamlined reporting processes by eliminating the need for multiple static reports, reducing analysis time, and enhancing communication among trauma team members. Monthly reviews of performance indicators supported real-time monitoring of compliance with American College of Surgeons standards. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the dashboard improved operational efficiency and facilitated data-driven decision-making. This project demonstrates how applied informatics tools can enhance trauma program performance and verification readiness while supporting broader quality improvement efforts in clinical practice.",Szydziak E; Mon NO; Cardozo-Stolberg S; Santos-Revilla G; Augustin G; Angus LDG,"Department of Surgery, Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, NY.","Computers, informatics, nursing : CIN",2026-01-28,10.1097/cin.0000000000001480,10.9,"visualization(abstract); dashboard(kw,title,abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract); informatics(abstract)",Quality improvement; Registries; R Programming Language; Interactive Dashboard; Dashboard Systems
41587987,A magnetically actuated robotic capsule endoscope for in-situ visualization and microneedle-mediated targeted drug delivery in gastrointestinal tract.,"Capsule endoscopy has revolutionized gastrointestinal (GI) diagnosis but is limited to imaging, often requiring invasive procedures for subsequent therapy. This work presents a magnetically actuated robotic capsule endoscope (MARCE) that integrates controllable magnetic navigation, real-time visualization, and targeted drug delivery via microneedle patches to bridge the gap between diagnosis and therapy. The MARCE features a retractable micro-camera for continuous monitoring of the GI tract, dual-layer hyaluronic acid microneedle patches enabling multi-point drug administration, and an electrothermally triggered protective cover to prevent premature dissolution in GI fluids. Sized similarly to conventional clinical capsules (11.8 mm in diameter and 21.5 mm in length), the MARCE demonstrates controlled epinephrine release from its microneedle patches (up to 0.4 mg) and provides sufficient magnetic actuation force (~0.58 N) and torque (~18.4 N mm) for intestine locomotion and penetration. Driven by a custom-developed electromagnetic actuation system, the MARCE achieves precise 3D locomotion with an average positional error <1.5 mm controlled microneedles penetration (with a peak force of 0.15 N), and successful drug delivery across multiple lesions in ex-vivo porcine intestinal tissue. This integrated platform streamlines diagnostic-therapeutic workflows, offering a minimally invasive solution for GI disorders such as bleeding, with potential to enhance patient comfort and treatment precision.",Chen W; Sui J; Cao X; Huang J; Chen F; Zhao K; Li Y; Liu X; Yuan Z; Zhang J; Jiang L; Xie X; Wang C,"State Key Laboratory for High Performance Tools, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Minimally Invasive Surgical Instruments and Manufacturing Technology, School of Electromechanical Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.",Microsystems & nanoengineering,2026-01-26,10.1038/s41378-025-01145-5,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",
41586954,Deep learning reconstruction accelerated reduced field-of-view DWI in rectal cancer: mucosa-submucosa-muscularis visualization and T staging.,"<h4>Objective</h4>We compared the image quality and diagnostic performance of deep learning reconstruction (DLR) accelerated reduced field-of-view (rFOV<sub>DL</sub>) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with standard-reconstructed full field-of-view (fFOV<sub>STA</sub>) DWI in rectal cancer.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This prospective study enrolled 173 participants with biopsy-confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma from November 2022 to August 2023 undergoing rFOV<sub>DL</sub> and fFOV<sub>STA</sub> DWI scans. Two radiologists evaluated qualitative image quality, objective image quality, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) independently. T and N staging were evaluated in 94 participants undergoing radical surgery. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated using histopathologic results as the gold standard. ADC values were analyzed for correlations with histopathologic staging.<h4>Results</h4>We observed that rFOV<sub>DL</sub> DWI reduced acquisition time by 30% compared to fFOV<sub>STA</sub> DWI. rFOV<sub>DL</sub> DWI outperformed fFOV<sub>STA</sub> DWI in all qualitative image quality metrics (p ≤ 0.013), especially in mucosa-submucosa-muscularis visualization, spatial resolution, overall image quality, and diagnostic confidence, accompanied by comparable objective image quality (p ≥ 0.054). When applied with T2-weighted imaging, rFOV<sub>DL</sub> DWI significantly enhanced primary T-staging accuracy than fFOV<sub>STA</sub> DWI (p < 0.001), especially for early-stage tumors (T1 or T2). Tumor ADC values of rFOV<sub>DL</sub> DWI were lower than those of fFOV<sub>STA</sub> DWI, yet remained solid inverse correlations with histopathologic T-staging (p < 0.001). Higher inter-reader agreements of locoregional staging and ADC measurements were obtained by rFOV<sub>DL</sub> DWI.<h4>Conclusion</h4>rFOV<sub>DL</sub> DWI significantly improved image quality than fFOV<sub>STA</sub> DWI, with a 30% reduced acquisition time. rFOV<sub>DL</sub> DWI facilitated higher primary T-staging accuracy, especially for early-stage rectal cancer (T1-T2).<h4>Relevance statement</h4>Reduced acquisition time and improved imaging quality highlighted the clinical feasibility of applying DLR to rFOV DWI. rFOV<sub>DL</sub> DWI could significantly enhance primary T-staging accuracy, especially for early-stage rectal cancer (T1-T2), facilitating more precise treatment management.<h4>Key points</h4>Applying deep learning reconstruction (DLR) to reduced field-of-view (rFOV) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) improved mucosa-submucosa-muscularis visualization and reduced acquisition time. DLR-based rFOV DWI significantly enhanced primary T-staging accuracy for rectal cancer, especially for early-stage tumors (T1 or T2).

41593265,Shaping the Future of Evidence Generation: Real-World Data to Drive Healthcare Transformation and Patient-Centered Decisions.,"The increasing complexity of healthcare decision making and the demand for real-world evidence call for a transformation in how Medical Affairs departments generate and communicate evidence. In response, AstraZeneca Spain implemented a structured stakeholder-driven framework aligned with the Clinical Evidence 2030 and Medical Affairs 2030 visions, aiming to deliver high-impact, timely, and tailored insights across each therapeutic area. An ambitious evidence generation vision was developed around two core components: (1) enhanced therapeutic area knowledge leading to improvements in guideline-directed medical therapy for patients and (2) strategic use of evidence for the company, leading to improved efficiency in delivering healthcare innovation for patients. The first component encompasses a broad spectrum of study modalities, such as the generation of real-world data on the use of medicines, health economics and outcomes research, predictive analytics, clinical management, and patient experience studies using diverse data sources, including real-world databases, registries, and electronic health records. Studies address different research questions and data gaps, including disease burden, treatment patterns, economic modeling, patient experience through ethnographic research, and knowledge derived from artificial intelligence-driven analytics. The second component seeks to ensure that the evidence generated is used strategically. First, it should be the basis for the development of a powerful Value Story that conveys the clinical, economic, and humanistic value of a pharmaceutical product and creates confidence in regulators, payers, and prescribers, thereby strengthening its therapeutic positioning. Second, the evidence generated needs to be presented to stakeholders in a dynamic manner, enhancing decision-making processes and fostering real-time engagement with healthcare providers and payers. Here, we present a data visualization tool that was developed to this end, termed ATLAS. Third, results from real-world evidence studies can be used to inform outcome-based agreements with payers. This type of innovative value strategy that goes beyond traditional financial agreements represents a method to ensure that the clinical and economic value delivered by a product is reflected in healthcare pricing and reimbursement models, facilitating broader access and timely patient care. AstraZeneca Spain's evidence generation approach represents a significant contribution to the evolution of Medical Affairs into a strategic driver of healthcare innovation and, ultimately, patient benefit. It implies an effort in the consolidation of unique features such as the increase in robust methodological capabilities and versatility in the design of studies, the leverage of predictive analytics, the development of advanced data visualization tools, the emphasis on patient-centered research, and the collaboration with partners expert in emerging technologies. The ultimate goals of an ambitious evidence generation vision like this are to provide the data needed for decision making at all levels, to identify opportunities to enhance diagnosis, to accelerate access to innovative therapies, and to ensure more patients receive optimal care.",Medina J; Sánchez-Covisa J; Nuevo J; Galvez-Fernandez M; García A; Pimentel B; Fitas E; Fernández E; Walton RN; Petrovska M; Pérez Domínguez A,"Medical Affairs Department, AstraZeneca Spain, C. del Puerto de Somport 21-23, Fuencarral-El Pardo, 28050, Madrid, Spain.",Pharmaceutical medicine,2026-01-28,10.1007/s40290-025-00599-2,6.3,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); data(title,abstract); electronic health record(abstract)",
41586896,Visualizing xenobiotics and metabolites in zebrafish by VUV-laser desorption post-ionization mass spectrometry imaging.,"Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables spatial mapping of chemical distributions across complex surfaces, with broad applications spanning materials analysis, life sciences, and clinical diagnostics. However, conventional ionization sources often suffer from limited ionization efficiency, creating a trade-off between detection sensitivity and spatial resolution. Post-ionization technology addresses this constraint by incorporating a secondary ionization step, significantly enhancing ionization yield and establishing itself as a leading approach for advancing mass spectrometry techniques. In this study, we have independently developed a vacuum ultraviolet-laser desorption post-ionization mass spectrometry (VUV-LDPI-MS) system, which significantly enhances detection sensitivity through the implementation of post-ionization technology. By integrating low-photon-energy long-wavelength laser desorption with the soft-ionizing capability of VUV light, this technique enhances the detection of chemical species within biological tissues-including both exogenous drugs and endogenous metabolites. The method achieved a theoretical detection limit of 8.3 pg/spot for methylene blue (MB), while markedly reducing substrate effects and sample background interference. Imaging results revealed that endogenous compounds closely aligned with zebrafish tissue anatomy, whereas the spatial distribution of exogenous MB strongly correlated with optical images. Successful application to zebrafish tissue sections enabled clear visualization of both MB and intrinsic metabolites. VUV-LDPI-MSI offers superior ionization efficiency with minimal sample preparation, presenting a robust alternative to conventional LDI-MS approaches and holding considerable promise for future technological development.",Li A; Lu S; Shang X; Zhang H; Xie M; Lu Q; Hu Y,"MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Spectral Analysis and Functional Probes, College of Biophotonics School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2026-01-26,10.1007/s00216-026-06344-1,4.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Zebrafish; Mass Spectrometry Imaging; Vacuum Ultraviolet Light; Laser Desorption Post-ionization
41586530,A Prospective Randomized Clinical Study on Comparative Analysis of SaCo VLM LMA and Endotracheal Intubation in Patients Undergoing Tympanoplasty.,"To overcome these issues, video-assisted laryngeal masks (VLMAs) have been developed, allowing for real-time visualization of glottic structures through integrated camera systems. Data can be provided for patient longevity and durability, comparing ETT and SaCoVLM LMA placement times, number of attempts, hemodynamic responses, stability in head and neck positions, and postoperative changes (throat guarantee, dysphagia, dysphonia, and laryngospasm) across sections in tympanoplasty procedures. In our randomized prospective clinical search, after cases were divided into 2 groups, demographic and operation information, airway device placement trial and duration, hemodynamic data, and postoperative complications were recorded. Patient demographics were homogeneous. Anesthesia duration, operative times, insertion times, and the number of attempts were shorter in the SaCoVLM LMA group. Hemodynamic data showed higher arterial pressures and heart rates immediately after insertion, at 1-minute and 5-minute postinsertion. Postoperative complications were less widespread in the SaCoVLM LMA group. In conclusion, our data analysis suggests that the SaCo VLM LMA may be advantageous over the ETT regarding insertion time, cardiovascular stability, and postoperative complications. However, it should be noted that the placement may shift during use, especially during head rotation, potentially leading to ventilation problems.",Selcuk Kusderci H; Oterkuş M; Ozdemir D; Doger C; Akdeniz S; Kayikci E,"Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Samsun University, Faculty of Medicine.",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,2026-01-26,10.1097/scs.0000000000012493,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Tympanoplasty; Endotracheal Intubation; Saco Vlm Video Laryngeal Mask
41603218,Preoperatively Predicting Risk Stratification for GISTs ≤2 cm by Radiomics Model: A Dual-center Study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Small gastrointestinal stromal tumors (SGISTs, maximum diameter≤2 cm) still carry a risk of malignancy, and their preoperative evaluation remains a significant challenge. Radiomics, an emerging technique for analyzing image data, has yet to be employed to assess the risk stratification of SGISTs. To develop and validate a CT radiomics model for the preoperative prediction of risk stratification in patients with SGISTs.<h4>Method</h4>This study enrolled 133 patients with SGISTs, including 97 in the low-grade group and 36 in the high-grade group. Patients were randomly assigned to a training set (n = 93) and a testing set (n = 40) at a ratio of 7:3. Radiomics features were extracted from preoperative CT images, and dimensionality reduction was performed using the LR-LASSO to identify the most predictive features for constructing the radiomics model. Clinical features were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to develop a clinical model. Subsequently, the optimal radiomics and clinical features were integrated to establish a combined model. Model performance was evaluated using ROC curve analysis, and a corresponding nomogram was generated to facilitate clinical application. The Delong test was used to compare the ROC curves, with a p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>Univariable clinical analysis identified maximal tumour diameter as the only significant predictor, with the clinical model achieving an AUC of 0.641 (95% CI: 0.533-0.748). Among the radiomics signatures derived from multiphase CT (non-contrast to delayed phases), the model based on portal venous phase images demonstrated the highest discriminative ability, yielding the best AUC values in both the training set (AUC = 0.848, 95% CI: 0.764-0.931) and the testing set (AUC = 0.824, 95% CI: 0.696-0.953). The combined model, which integrated radiomics features with maximum tumour diameter, demonstrated improved performance, attaining an AUC of 0.862 (95% CI: 0.743-0.975) in the training set and 0.859 (95% CI: 0.743-0.975) in the testing set. Notably, the predictive performance of both the radiomics and combined models was significantly greater than that of the clinical model (DeLong test, P < 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the AUC values of the radiomics and combined models. Calibration curves indicated a good fit, and the DCA demonstrated that both the radiomics model and the combined model provided greater clinical benefits.<h4>Discussion</h4>The radiomics model demonstrated superior performance to the clinical model for the preoperative prediction of risk stratification in SGISTs. As a visualization tool, the nomogram of the combined model plays a critical role in optimizing early surgical resection decisions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The radiomics model could serve as an effective tool for non-invasive risk stratification of SGISTs, offering clear advantages over risk stratification models based solely on conventional clinical parameters. This approach could support improved preoperative clinical decisionmaking.",Wu RJ; Tan Y; Zhang ZX; Feng Y; Wu YM,"Department of Medical Imaging, Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Province, Taiyuan, China.",Current medical imaging,2026-01-27,10.2174/0115734056419448251211063018,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),computed tomography; Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors; Radiomics; Nomogram.; Risk Stratifications
41603993,Impact of arthroscopic experience on the learning curve in interlaminar endoscopic lumbar discectomy: a single-center prospective cohort study of 240 patients.,"<h4>Study design</h4>Prospective single-center observational cohort study.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess whether prior arthroscopic experience is associated with a shorter learning curve in uniportal interlaminar endoscopic lumbar discectomy (IELD), primarily in terms of operative efficiency, and to descriptively evaluate perioperative complications and patient-reported outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>In accordance with STROBE guidelines, 240 consecutive patients with single-level lumbar disc herniation (MSU A/B, non-calcified, symptom duration ≤ 3 months) underwent IELD between 2021 and 2023 at a single academic orthopedic center. Procedures were performed by three spine surgeons without prior endoscopic experience; one surgeon had performed more than 300 shoulder arthroscopies. Operative time was analyzed using cumulative sum (CUSUM) methodology and linear regression. Missing outcome data were handled using last observation carried forward. Complications were recorded descriptively and stratified by learning phase and surgeon. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for back and leg pain were assessed preoperatively and at 3 and 12 months.<h4>Results</h4>All surgeons demonstrated a three-phase learning curve consisting of learning, improvement, and stabilization phases. Operative efficiency stabilized after approximately 50 cases across surgeons. The surgeon with prior arthroscopic experience reached the CUSUM inflection point earlier (case 12) compared with the other surgeons (cases 24-26). The overall major complication rate was 9.2% and was highest during the initial learning phase. ODI and VAS scores improved significantly at 3 and 12 months (all p < 0.001), with no statistically significant between-surgeon differences at final follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Prior arthroscopic experience was associated with earlier adaptation during the initial learning phase of IELD, as measured by operative time. Following procedural stabilization, no statistically significant differences were detected in operative efficiency, major complication rates, or patient-reported outcomes between surgeons. These findings suggest that arthroscopic experience may facilitate early adaptation to endoscopic visualization and workflow but does not independently determine long-term clinical outcomes.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>III.",Sienkiel T; Gąska M; Koszyk P; Lipik E; Jasiewicz B,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Hospital, Zakopane, Poland. sienkiel.tomasz@gmail.com.","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",2026-01-28,10.1007/s00586-026-09758-8,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Learning Curve; Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery; Surgical Education; Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy; Interlaminar Approach; Cusum Analysis; Arthroscopic Experience
41586915,Efficacy of intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) and FLOW 800 in the surgical management of intracranial aneurysms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intraoperative assessment of aneurysm clipping remains technically challenging, particularly in identifying misclippings, aneurysmal remnants, and vessel compromise. Indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) provides real-time visualization but lacks hemodynamic quantification. FLOW 800 is a semi quantitative analysis tool that enhances blood flow evaluation. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the combined diagnostic efficacy of ICG-VA and FLOW 800 in intracranial aneurysm surgery, focusing on intraoperative outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review was conducted in five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251014600). Twelve studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (344 aneurysms), of which eight contributed quantitative data to the meta-analysis (277 aneurysms). Pooled proportions of misclipping, aneurysmal remnant, vascular stenosis/occlusion, and clip repositioning were calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses, meta-regression, leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, and assessment of publication bias (funnel plot) were performed. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool.<h4>Results</h4>The pooled intraoperative detection rates using ICG-VA and FLOW 800 were: misclipping 9.36% (95% CI: 4.75-17.64), aneurysm remnant 6.55% (95% CI: 3.29-12.65), vessel stenosis or occlusion 6.90% (95% CI: 3.28-13.96), and clip repositioning 8.13% (95% CI: 4.05-15.63). Retrospective studies showed higher detection rates than prospective ones. Meta-regression identified study design as a significant predictor for all outcomes (p < 0.0001), while older patient age was associated with increased remnant detection (p = 0.0247) and clip repositioning (p = 0.0073). Funnel plots revealed slight asymmetry, and GRADE evaluation indicated moderate certainty for misclipping and clip repositioning, and low certainty for remnants and stenosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The combined use of ICG-VA and FLOW 800 enhances the intraoperative detection of misclipping, residual aneurysm, and flow disturbances not evident with ICG-VA alone. These findings support its role as a complementary intraoperative tool. However, due to limited validation against angiographic standards, it should not replace DSA. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm its clinical utility and encourage broader adoption in neurosurgical practice.",Turpo-Pequeña AG; Santos-Vargas SA; Loza-Chipa HR; Lamas FM; Espinoza-Laura GA; Núñez-Basurco CS; Medina-Neira DN; Benites-Bustamante VA; Osorio-Pacheco RR; Turpo-Peqqueña JR; Huanca-Quispe G; Vizcarra-Vizcarra CA; Gómez B; Rivillas JA; Hernández-Mayori R,"Faculty of Human Medicine, Center for Research and Medical Studies (CIEM), Universidad Católica de Santa María, Arequipa, Perú. albert.turpo@estudiante.ucsm.edu.pe.",Acta neurochirurgica,2026-01-26,10.1007/s00701-026-06779-6,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Intracranial aneurysm; Indocyanine green; Intraoperative Imaging; Flow 800
41588820,Dual-Window Broadband Near-Infrared Mechanoluminescence in MgO-Based Phosphors.,"Near-infrared (NIR) mechanoluminescence (ML) offers a self-powered and non-invasive route for stress visualization and biomechanical imaging, yet most NIR ML materials remain constrained by narrow emission bandwidths and reliance on dark-field conditions. Here, we report two complementary MgO-based ML systems spanning the NIR-I and NIR-II windows, establishing MgO as a robust platform for broadband mechanoresponsive emission. MgO:Cr<sup>3+</sup> delivers tunable NIR-I ML (700-1000 nm; full width at half maximum, FWHM, 94-188 nm) under diverse mechanical stimuli, including friction, impact, tension, compression, bending, and twisting, while MgO:Ni<sup>2+</sup> produces ultrabroadband NIR-II ML (1000-1700 nm; FWHM 225 nm) readily detectable under ambient lighting. Mechanistic studies reveal that ML arises from the synergistic interplay of local piezoelectric polarization, dislocation-mediated charge separation, and triboelectric effects at organic-inorganic interfaces, whereas the observed spectral variations stem from crystal-field modulation and lattice distortions. Co-doping of Cr<sup>3+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> further differentiates optical and mechanical excitation pathways-optical excitation induces Cr<sup>3+</sup>-sensitized Ni<sup>2+</sup> emission, whereas mechanical excitation directly activates their low-lying levels. These insights unify mechano-to-photon conversion in centrosymmetric oxides and provide design principles for broadband, durable, and environmentally adaptive ML materials, advancing applications in multimodal sensing, structural health monitoring, and noninvasive biomechanical imaging.",Cai Y; Chang J; Zhang J; Liu J; Wang S; Wu M; Zhang JC,"College of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Faculty of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2026-01-26,10.1002/adma.202522739,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Biomechanical Imaging; Broadband Emission; Mgo Phosphor; Multiple Mechanical Sensing; Near‐infrared Mechanoluminescence
41587227,"Central Neuromuscular Reactivation Using Digital Mindfulness and Motor Imagery Intervention for Chronic Knee Pain in Patients With Obesity: Prospective, Single-Center Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Chronic musculoskeletal pain, particularly in patients with obesity, poses significant challenges due to increased pain sensitivity, reduced mobility, and systemic inflammation. Obesity aggravates mechanical constraints on the joints and increases systemic inflammation, exacerbating certain medical conditions and making conventional therapeutic approaches less likely to succeed. Conventional therapies often show limited efficacy, necessitating innovative approaches.<h4>Objective</h4>This pilot study evaluated the short-term effectiveness of a mindfulness and motor imagery-based intervention delivered via an app (SAS YUZIT), on the pain, functionality, and quality of life of patients with obesity and chronic knee pain.<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective, single-center study was conducted over 1 month by including 30 patients (BMI >30 kg/m2) experiencing chronic knee pain (≥3 months) who did not need surgery. Patients underwent two video-guided motor imagery sessions, focusing on neuromuscular reactivation. Functional scores, including the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) score, were assessed before and after intervention. Paired t tests were used to analyze score improvements, with P<.05 deemed significant.<h4>Results</h4>Significant improvements were observed across all parameters. The mean overall SANE score improved by 51% (P<.001). The minimal clinically important difference was therefore approximately 6.7 points. The observed mean improvement (25 points) exceeded this threshold by more than threefold, indicating a clinically meaningful improvement in functional status. The mean (SD) KOOS score increased by 56% (P<.001) from 40.89 (16.7) to 63.79 (14.6). The mean (SD) SF-36 scores showed substantial enhancements in both physical (from 39.7 [20.8] to 65.9 [18.8]; +66%; P<.001) and mental components (from 47.2 [23.1] to 64 [21]; +36%; P<.001). Patient satisfaction with this method was rated 4.5/5, and no adverse effects were reported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Video-guided motor imagery demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing pain and improving the functionality and quality of life of patients with obesity and chronic knee pain. By targeting central neuromuscular circuits through guided visualization exercises, this non-invasive intervention addresses central activation dysfunction, a proposed novel concept in neuromuscular disorders that originates from hypotheses derived from clinical observations. This interesting concept requires further exploration to ensure its neurophysiological validation through future studies with larger sample sizes, control groups, and long-term follow-ups, all of which could explore CAD as a therapeutic target.",Murgier J; Garet B; Murgier S; Zunzarren G,"Aguilera Private Clinic, Rue de l'estagnas, Biarritz, 64100, France, +33 0973032124.",JMIR formative research,2026-01-26,10.2196/82270,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Obesity; Motor imagery; Knee Pain; Digital Mindfulness; Central Neuromuscular Reactivation

To develop and validate a CT-based DL model combined with nutritional biomarkers to predict 3-year overall survival (OS) in ESCC, and to investigate transcriptomic differences between DLS-based risk groups.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective multicenter study included 662 postoperative ESCC patients from three hospitals and 16 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). DL features extraction from CT images based on the Crossformer architecture. Skeletal muscle index was measured at the L3 vertebra to assess low skeletal muscle mass (LSMM). Cox regression was used to build clinical, DL, and combined models. Model performance was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index). Transcriptomic analysis of the TCGA cohort was performed to identify metabolic pathway differences between DLS-based risk groups.<h4>Results</h4>The DL model achieved a C-index of 0.743 (95% CI: 0.683-0.803) in the internal validation cohort and 0.692 (95% CI: 0.576-0.809) in the external cohort. Pathological T and N stages, Neuroaggression, Vascular invasion, and LSMM were identified as independent clinical predictors. The combined model achieved a C-index of 0.753 (95% CI: 0.697-0.808) internally and 0.725 (95% CI: 0.613-0.838) externally. DLS-based risk stratification revealed significant differences in metabolic activity between groups, supporting its biological relevance.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The combined model enables preoperative OS prediction in ESCC. DLS-based stratification reflects transcriptomic metabolic heterogeneity and enhances the biological interpretability of imaging features.<h4>Critical relevance statement</h4>This study developed a CT-based DLS and combined it with nutritional markers for prognostic modeling in ESCC. Transcriptomic analysis of DLS-based groups revealed metabolic heterogeneity, enhancing the biological interpretability of the DL model.<h4>Key points</h4>A combined DLS and nutritional model enables individualized preoperative survival prediction in ESCC.

41604719,Preclinical magnetic resonance imaging in the presence of Alpha-DaRT seeds: mitigation of metal artifacts. ,"Diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy (Alpha-DaRT) involves implanting stainless steel seeds containing 70-200 kBq of224Ra into solid tumors. The decay of224Ra generates alpha particles and short-lived alpha-emitting atoms, which diffuse and deposit absorbed dose up to millimeters from the seed. The investigation of diffusion length from the alpha-emitting daughters is ongoing through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided pre-clinicalin-vivostudies. However, the metallic seeds cause metal artifacts in MRI, distorting signals and degrading images. Overcoming these artifacts is essential for accurate tumor assessment and treatment planning. This study aimed to reduce metal artifacts in images acquired with 7 T preclinical MRI in the presence of Alpha-DaRT seeds using an orthotopic colorectal adenocarcinoma animal model.&#xD;Approach: Inert seeds were placed in gelatin phantoms and the dorsal cavity of a mouse carcass. For thein-vivoanimal model, NOD scid gamma mice with HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma tumors (∽5-7 mm) were injected with inert seeds. MRI sequence parameters such as echo and repetition times, slice thickness, and readout bandwidth were tested using the phantom and refined with carcass imaging, leading toin-vivoimaging.&#xD;Main results: Multiple sequence protocols were tested on gelatin phantoms and compared to the original T2w rapid acquisition relaxation enhanced sequence protocol. A T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequence reduced metal artifacts in the gelatin phantom from 2.910 ± 0.001 mm to 1.426 ± 0.001 mm in the sagittal reformat, resulting in a 51% reduction. Validation in the mouse carcass confirmed high-quality soft-tissue imaging.In-vivoimages with live mice showed a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in metal artifact volume with the optimized sequence.&#xD;Significance: A T2-weighted turbo spin echo protocol effectively minimized metal artifacts from Alpha-DaRT seeds in a colorectal adenocarcinoma animal model, allowing for clearer visualization of seed placement within the tumor and improving the accuracy of pre-clinical studies.",Cyr M; Rudko D; Behmand B; Enger SA; Levesque IR,"Department of Oncology, McGill University Faculty of Medicine, 845 Sherbrooke Street W, Montreal, Quebec, H3A0G4, CANADA.",Biomedical physics & engineering express,2026-01-28,10.1088/2057-1976/ae3e9e,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41588632,MRI Analysis of the Axial Plane Orientation of the Achilles Tendon: Implications for Level-Specific Percutaneous Repair Trajectories.,"<h4>Background</h4>Percutaneous Achilles tendon repair has become increasingly favored because of its lower rate of wound complications compared with open techniques. However, its success rates are limited and rely on precise tendon capture, which can be challenging because of limited intraoperative visualization. Previous clinical and cadaveric studies have reported frequent cases of incomplete or eccentric suture placement with this approach. Although not the only factor in improving the results of percutaneous Achilles repair, understanding the positional anatomy of the Achilles could be helpful in improving capture of the tendon. This study aimed to characterize the level-dependent axial orientation of the distal Achilles tendon using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), focusing on levels relevant to percutaneous needle passage to improve the accuracy of repair.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective review of MRI scans from 82 individuals without Achilles pathology was performed. The axial orientation of the tendon was measured at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 cm proximal to its calcaneal insertion, relative to both the transmalleolar (TM) axis and the insertional tendon axis. Tendon width was also measured at each level. All measurements were performed using multiplanar reconstructed images, and differences across levels were analyzed using a linear mixed effects model with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A separate age-matched cohort of patients with acute Achilles rupture (n = 82) was also analyzed to compare orientation patterns between normal and ruptured tendons.<h4>Results</h4>The Achilles tendon orientation exhibited level-dependent variation in external rotation proximally when measured relative to the TM axis, increasing from 2.1 degrees (95% CI, 0.8-3.4) at 3 cm to a peak of 11.2 degrees at 7 cm (95% CI, 9.3-13.1) and 9 cm (95% CI, 9.6-12.8), with a slight decrease at 11 cm. When referenced to the insertional axis, a transition from internal to external rotation was observed between 5 and 7 cm (Δ = +6.6 degrees, <i>P</i> < .001). The narrowest tendon width was also noted at 5 cm (13.3 mm), with greater width observed both proximally and distally. In the ruptured cohort, the tendon demonstrated a more externally rotated configuration at the rupture zone compared with normal tendons.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Achilles tendon demonstrates level-dependent variation in axial orientation along its length, with a general tendency toward external rotation at more proximal levels. Although there are currently no established guidelines regarding needle trajectory during percutaneous repair, these findings suggest that a uniform axial needle path may not align with native tendon anatomy at all levels. Adjusting the direction of suture passage based on the specific level of repair may enhance procedural accuracy during percutaneous Achilles repair. Notably, these MRI-based recommendations have not been validated with cadaveric or other biomechanical testing.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Level III, diagnostic retrospective study.",Kim J; Sacks J; Masry SE; Ward L; Ellis S; Deland J,"Foot and ankle service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.",Foot & ankle international,2026-01-26,10.1177/10711007251398000,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),MRI; Rotation; Percutaneous; repair; Tendon; Achilles; Minimal Invasive; Axial
