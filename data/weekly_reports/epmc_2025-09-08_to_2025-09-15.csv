40925597,Investigating Information Visualization to Combat Information Overload in Electronic Health Records: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>Electronic health records (EHRs) have been linked to information overload, which can lead to cognitive fatigue, a precursor to burnout. This can cause health care providers to miss critical information and make clinical errors, leading to delays in care delivery. This challenge is particularly pronounced in medical intensive care units (ICUs), where patients are critically ill and their EHRs contain extensive and complex data.<h4>Objective</h4>We propose to study the effect of an information visualization dashboard on ICU providers' cognitive fatigue in 4 major US medical centers. In this randomized controlled trial, we will compare 2 leading EHRs with a visualization dashboard-based EHR called AWARE.<h4>Methods</h4>This crossover randomized trial will collect physiological and objective data using a screen-mounted eye-tracking device to assess cognitive fatigue among ICU providers. The study will involve 120 ICU providers from 4 US medical centers, with each site using its institutional EHR as the control and the AWARE EHR as the intervention. Participants will be randomly assigned to use either their institutional EHR or the AWARE EHR first, followed by the other EHR, with the order of EHR use and patient case order randomized by the study team. The AWARE tool is designed to integrate within an existing EHR system and provides clinical support tools, such as the ability to trend data points from body systems at a glance. Data analysis will include eye-tracking metrics, performance measures, and validated surveys to evaluate EHR usability and its impact on clinical decision-making. Primary outcomes include the number of cognitive fatigue instances per patient case, time to complete each case, overall usability of the session, number of mouse clicks per case, provider performance scores from questions asked during each patient case, and perceived usability of each EHR. Secondary outcomes include the number of eye fixations per patient case and perceived workload of each EHR.<h4>Results</h4>This EHR usability study was funded in 2021 and initiated in 2022, with a completion date of 2025. Data collection began in August 2023. As of now, 3 of the 4 study sites have completed data collection, with a total of 113 completed sessions thus far. Data collection is ongoing at the fourth site. Preliminary analysis is ongoing, and we expect to begin publishing results in late 2025.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Findings from this research may inform improvements in EHR interface design and usability, which may enhance provider performance, streamline care delivery, and improve patient safety outcomes.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05937646; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05937646.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/74247.",Khairat S; Morelli J; Boynton MH; Bice T; Gold JA; Carson SS,"Carolina Health Informatics Program, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.",JMIR research protocols,2025-09-09,10.2196/74247,20.4,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract); electronic health record(kw,title,abstract)","Electronic Health Records; Eye-tracking; Information Overload; Ehr Usability; Information Visualization, Cognitive Fatigue"
40921828,Effect of music therapy and relaxation visualization intervention on mask anxiety in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy-a randomized controlled trial.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT) often experience mask anxiety due to the use of thermoplastic masks for immobilization. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a combined music therapy and relaxation-visualization intervention in reducing mask anxiety among HNC patients receiving RT at a tertiary care super-specialty oncology hospital in central India.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 216 HNC patients scheduled for RT were randomized into either the intervention group (N = 108) or the control group (N = 108). Mask anxiety was assessed using a modified distress thermometer (MDT) at baseline and after five RT sessions. Participants in the intervention group listened to pre-recorded soft instrumental, non-lyrical music and practiced a guided relaxation-visualization technique during their first five RT sessions. The control group received standard medical care.<h4>Results</h4>Of the enrolled participants, 208 were included in the final statistical analysis (intervention group: N = 100; control group: N = 108). At the end of five RT sessions, the intervention group showed a statistically significant reduction in mask anxiety scores [median (IQR): 2 (2)] compared to the control group [median (IQR): 6 (1)], with p < 0.001. No adverse events were reported. However, four participants discontinued the intervention, citing distracting thoughts and difficulty concentrating.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings support the potential of music therapy combined with relaxation-visualization as an effective non-pharmacological intervention to alleviate mask anxiety in HNC patients undergoing RT. Integrating such complementary strategies into routine oncology practice may enhance emotional well-being, promote treatment adherence, and improve overall treatment outcomes. Further large-scale validation is warranted.<h4>Registration number of the clinical trial</h4>CTRI/2023/02/049409 (Registered prospectively on 02/02/2023).",Joshi AM; Mehta SA; Tandiya P; Sonwani V; Pervez S; Jain S; Singh R; Wadhwani S,"Department of Psycho-Oncology, HCG Cancer Center, Khasra No. 50, 51, Mouja Wanjri, Bande Nawaz Nagar, Near Automotive Square, Kalamna Ring Road, Nagpur, 440026, Maharashtra, India. dranjali.j@hcgel.com.",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2025-09-08,10.1007/s00520-025-09901-z,11.5,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract)",Radiotherapy; Head And Neck Cancer; Music Therapy; Mask Anxiety; Relaxation-visualization

40921061,Need Analysis of Clinician-Oriented Integrated Precision Oncology Decision Support Tools: Qualitative Descriptive Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The rapid advancement of next-generation sequencing has significantly expanded the landscape of precision medicine. However, health care professionals face increasing challenges in keeping pace with the growing body of oncological knowledge and integrating it effectively into clinical workflows. Precision oncology decision support (PODS) tools aim to assist clinicians in navigating this complexity, yet their current functionalities only partially address clinical needs. A lack of comprehensive needs assessment may result in unaddressed requirements, limiting the effectiveness of these tools in real-world practice.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to explore clinicians' needs and expectations regarding the functionalities of integrated PODS tools, providing insights into essential features that could enhance their usability and impact.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a qualitative investigation at Peking University Cancer Hospital to explore clinicians' needs and expectations for the functions of integrated PODS tools. Data were collected through 143 structured participant observations during multidisciplinary team meetings and 17 in-depth semistructured interviews with a diverse group of oncology specialists, including physicians, surgeons, molecular biologists, radiotherapists, radiologists, and pathologists. Thematic analysis was applied to identify key functional requirements, and a requirements framework was formed.<h4>Results</h4>Three overarching functional needs emerged: (1) better access to oncological knowledge, including support for therapy selection (guidelines, conferences, and consensuses), clinical trials, drug and treatment information, and complex case knowledge, as well as improved diagnostic and prognostic insights; (2) clinical contextualization and resource navigation, referring to the process of contextualizing scientific knowledge within real-world clinical settings, including access to clinical trials and drugs, along with predictive models for treatment response; and (3) support abilities in the decision-making process, highlighting the need for integration of flexible biological knowledge and phenotypic data; automated patient information synthesis; improved data visualization; and optimized retrieval, recommendation, and question-answering functionalities. A functional framework for integrated PODS tools was proposed based on these findings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study conducted a qualitative descriptive observation and interview in the use, needs of integrated PODS tools. PODS tools serve as complex, multilevel decision support systems. A clear understanding of clinicians' actual needs is crucial for their refinement and practical adoption. By capturing perspectives directly from oncology professionals, this study provides actionable insights into the functional enhancements required for PODS tools, ultimately aiming to bridge the gap between genomic advancements and clinical decision-making in precision oncology.",Zheng S; Feng Y; Long J; Li X; Zhang M; Chen H; Du X; Duan H; Jia S; Wu N; Lu X,"College of Biomedical Engineering & Instrument Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.",JMIR human factors,2025-09-08,10.2196/67476,5.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw); data(abstract),Artificial intelligence; Needs Analysis; Structured Observation; Functional Framework; Precision Oncology Decision Support; Semistructured In-depth Interview
40939420,Enhancing data interoperability in human biomonitoring studies: the HBM data toolkit.,"Harmonization and aggregation of heterogeneous data from Human Biomonitoring (HBM) studies is critical to enhance the reliability of conclusions and move towards FAIR (i.e., Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data. We introduce the HBM Data Toolkit developed by the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologisch Onderzoek - VITO) with the primary goal of optimizing data integrity and interoperability, key steps towards FAIR, while using flexible templates and ensuring data confidentiality. The HBM Data Toolkit was built in 2023-2024 and made available for stakeholders (via https://hbm.vito.be/tools) within the Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC eu-parc.eu). The toolkit consists of 4 modules including data harmonization, data validation, derived variables, and summary statistics calculation. A Python package was created to interpret the templates, making validation and transformation possible. Using Pyodide and WebAssembly, the toolkit runs entirely in the web browser, enabling secure, local execution of Python code without uploading any data. In the validation module, input files in common format (i.e., Excel) were used to configure data templates, aligning with standards and formats as specified under the HBM4EU project (hbm4eu.eu) and PARC. The HBM Data Toolkit allows harmonized data storage in the Personal Exposure and Health (PEH) data platform. Formatted and validated HBM data were made compatible with the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) platform. In the derived variables calculation module, the toolkit also allows users to calculate imputed censored data and standardize/normalize the biomarker data. Furthermore, summary statistics (e.g., geometric mean, percentiles) can be calculated and further visualized in the European HBM dashboard and integrated into the Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring (IPCHEM). In conclusion, the current toolkit proves effective in advancing data quality, harmonization, and aggregation in HBM studies. With local execution, user-friendly codebooks, and standardized schemas, it supports a unified framework that enables consistent analysis and interpretation across diverse studies and datasets.",Peeters R; Rodriguez Martin L; Zhang F; Willems H; Gilles L; Theunis J; Bessems J; de Souza CMT; Baken S; Devriendt D; Govarts E,"VITO Health, Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), Boeretang 200, 2400, Mol, Belgium; KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Leuven.AI, Leuven, Belgium; Flanders Make@KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,2025-09-11,10.1016/j.ijheh.2025.114669,4.8,"dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Validation; WEB interface; Data Quality; Data Harmonization; Human Biomonitoring; Fair Data; Gdpr; Schema-based Tool
40916111,Implementing a Home Infusion Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection Dashboard: Considerations for Dashboard Development.,"Dashboards are commonly used in healthcare to monitor and respond to safety and quality data, but few data describe how to best implement dashboards in home infusion therapy. We developed a dashboard for a collaborative of home infusion agencies to monitor an important safety outcome, central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). We used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to understand key components of implementing a CLABSI surveillance dashboard in a home infusion therapy environment. We interviewed seven primary users of the dashboard to understand how the dashboard was implemented, including barriers and facilitators to its implementation. In this qualitative analysis, we used elements of the TAM to develop a new framework that describes how a dashboard can be implemented and used in a healthcare setting to support others who are developing and implementing quality or safety dashboards in home infusion therapy settings.",Hannum SM; Oladapo-Shittu O; Marsteller J; Cosgrove SE; Klein E; Gurses AP; Keller SC,,Home healthcare now,2025-09-08,10.1097/nhh.0000000000001368,4.4,"dashboard(title,abstract); data(abstract)",
40925635,Development and Implementation of a New Process to Improve Safety of Urgent Direct Admissions.,"<h4>Background</h4>Direct admission can help reduce emergency department crowding, improve patient satisfaction, and decrease costs, yet there is opportunity to improve standardized processes to do so safely and efficiently. We designed and implemented a new process for urgent direct admission (UDA) at our children's hospital with the SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound) aim to increase the number of UDAs between transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) within 12 hours from direct admission by 50% in 12 months.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared unanticipated ICU transfers within 12 hours of admission (outcome) before and after implementing a standardized UDA process. Process measures included number of UDA orders and admissions; balancing measures included rapid response calls within 12 hours of admission.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 2950 UDA orders were placed postimplementation. The average number of UDA admissions between ICU transfers increased from 41.4 to 162.6. Referring clinicians found the process easy to use and preferable to the previous system.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Implementation of a standardized UDA process improved patient safety and efficiency by increasing UDA use and reducing ICU transfers. Key components of the process included the following: clinical criteria for UDA, an electronic health record order including clinical decision support, automatic notification to admissions management, streamlined communication across the patient placement department, the referring clinician, and the family, and a quality metrics dashboard.",Hart J; Kuhn E; Nord E; Kerman C; Fieldston E; Kane E,"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",Hospital pediatrics,2025-09-10,10.1542/hpeds.2024-008239,4.0,dashboard(abstract); clinical decision support(abstract); electronic health record(abstract),
40945546,Towards modeling evolving longitudinal health trajectories with a transformer-based deep learning model.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Health registers provide valuable insights into individuals' health trajectories. This study explores the use of deep learning to model and analyze these trajectories using a nationwide longitudinal dataset containing coded features such as clinical codes, procedures, and drug purchases.<h4>Methods</h4>We introduce Evolve, a transformer-based deep learning model designed to provide continuous multi-label predictions over time. The model predicts disease onsets at each time step conditioned on the health history up to that time step and the time until a given 5-year forecast window. Evolve is evaluated against several baseline models for basic prediction performance. Additionally, we analyze health trajectories by tracking changes in prediction probabilities and in the latent embedding neighborhood to identify important events.<h4>Results</h4>Evolve performed comparably to baseline models in disease onset prediction while offering unique trajectory modeling capabilities. The model identified early predictive events and demonstrated that changes in embedding space could indicate shifts in health trajectories. Visualization of evolving health trajectories showed how individuals may become most similar to others with similar profiles and outcomes over time.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Evolve model seems promising at enabling continuous health monitoring, early disease detection, and retrospective analysis, making it a promising tool for personalized healthcare interventions.

40946219,Point-of-Care Meat Freshness Evaluation: Myoglobin-Involved Redox Reaction Analysis via Smartphone Imaging.,"Meat freshness is essential for ensuring food safety and protecting consumer health. However, substantial resource waste often occurs when consumers rely on their senses to assess meat. Herein, we developed a smartphone-based platform utilizing the biocompatible redox indicator resazurin to visualize meat freshness through specific redox reactions. Spectrophotometric and coloration analysis confirmed that myoglobin (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) exhibits reducing activity, with higher Fe<sup>2+</sup> content in fresh meat that correlates to stronger reducing capacity. This enhanced reducing capability produces more distinct color transitions as resazurin (blue) is reduced to resorufin (pink). Combined with color heatmaps extracted from RGB data of smartphone images, our approach has successfully evaluated the freshness of pork, beef, and chicken within 30 min, demonstrating its broad applicability and rapid detection capability. This low-cost (<$0.02 per test), nontoxic, and user-friendly (no instruments needed) visualization method shows great promise for promoting home-based meat freshness testing, thereby reducing resource waste while safeguarding consumer health.",Zhu H; Jiang Y; Wei YP; Ma MY; Wang JT; Liu XP; Wang L; Mao CJ,"Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Functionalized Materials, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, PR China.",Analytical chemistry,2025-09-14,10.1021/acs.analchem.5c02941,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40934489,Horizon Scanning Methods for Health Care Technology Innovation Identification: Rapid Scoping Review of Patent Research Studies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Patents are an early sign of innovation, yet their role in horizon scanning for health care remains unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>This study investigates the role of, and methods for, patent analysis in advancing health care technology innovation in a sector that is characterized by diverse health care technologies and significant research investment. Patents are critical early indicators of innovation, supporting horizon scanning and weak signal detection. The study aimed to identify intellectual property sources, evaluate methods for patent retrieval and analysis, and outline objectives for using patent data to anticipate trends and inform health care strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>A rapid scoping review was conducted following Cochrane Rapid Review Methods recommendations and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, with a preregistered protocol on the Open Science Framework. Searches in Embase, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science targeted records published 2020 onward to capture the most recent sources, methods, and tools. Three independent reviewers screened studies using Rayyan (Qatar Computing Research Institute). We included any study type published since 2020 that provided patent sources data, methods, and tools applied to the study of health care technologies. Our data extraction included bibliographic details, study characteristics, and methodological information. Risk of bias assessments were not undertaken. Narrative and tabular methods, supplemented by visual charts, were used to synthesize findings.<h4>Results</h4>Our searches identified 1741 studies, of which 124 were included after title, abstract, and full-text screening, with 54% being original research, 43.5% reviews, and the remainder being conference abstracts (2.5%). Most studies (68%) relied solely on patent databases, while others searched the gray and published literature. Research objectives of the included studies were grouped into 10 themes, with trend analysis (50%) and the provision of recommendations for future research, policy, and strategy development (20%) being the most common. Our review identified up to 47 patent databases, with 27% of studies using multiple sources. Whenever time limits were reported, the mean time horizon for patent searches was 24.6 years, ranging from 1900 to 2019. Automated approaches, used in 33% (n=43) of studies, frequently used tools such as Gephi (Gephi Consortium) for network visualization. Disease mapping based on National Institute for Health and Care Excellence classification indicated that cancer (19%) and respiratory conditions (16%), particularly COVID-19, were key areas.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patent data are valuable for identifying technological trends and informing policy and research strategies. While patents provide crucial insights into emerging technologies, inconsistent deduplication practices across studies pose the risk of data inflation, accentuating the need for transparency and rigor. Finally, this review emphasized the importance of data transformation and visualization in detecting emerging trends, with Python and R being the most commonly used programming languages for developing custom tools.",Garcia Gonzalez-Moral S; Pennock E; Ewedairo O; Green E; Elgey J; Mkwashi A,"NIHR Innovation Observatory, Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, The Catalyst Room 3.12, 3 Science Square Newcastle Helix, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 5TG, United Kingdom, 44 0191 2082262.",Interactive journal of medical research,2025-09-11,10.2196/70323,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Patent analysis; Horizon Scanning; Health Care Innovation; Medtech; Rapid Scoping Review
40938506,Bimodal ECG and PCG Cardiovascular Disease Detection: Exploring the Potential and Modality Contribution.,"Early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is crucial for improving patient outcomes and alleviating healthcare burdens. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) and phonocardiograms (PCGs) offer low-cost, non-invasive, and easily integrable solutions for preventive care settings. In this work, we propose a novel bimodal deep learning model that combines ECG and PCG signals to enhance the early detection of CVDs. To address the challenge of limited bimodal data, we fine-tuned a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on large-scale audio recordings, leveraging all publicly available unimodal PCG datasets. This PCG branch was then integrated with a 1D-CNN ECG branch via late fusion. Evaluated on an augmented version of MITHSDB, currently the only publicly available bimodal dataset, our approach achieved an AUROC of 96.4%, significantly outperforming ECG-only and PCG-only models by approximately 3%pts and 11%pts, respectively. To interpret the model's decisions, we applied three explainability techniques, quantifying the relative contributions of the electrical and acoustic features. Furthermore, by projecting the learned embeddings into two dimensions using UMAP, we revealed clear separation between normal and pathological samples. Our results conclusively demonstrate that combining ECG and PCG modalities yields substantial performance gains, with explainability and visualization providing critical insights into model behavior. These findings underscore the importance of multimodal approaches for CVDs diagnosis and prevention, and strongly motivate the collection of larger, more diverse bimodal datasets for future research.",Calzoni A; Savardi M; Silvestri M; Benini S; Signoroni A,"Department of Information Engineering, University of Brescia, Via Branze 38, Brescia, 25123, Italy. alessia.calzoni@unibs.it.",Journal of medical systems,2025-09-12,10.1007/s10916-025-02245-5,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Cardiovascular diseases; Electrocardiogram; Phonocardiogram; Multimodal Fusion; Transfer Learning; Bimodal Learning; Explainability
40929291,Deep feature engineering for accurate sperm morphology classification using CBAM-enhanced ResNet50.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>Male fertility assessment through sperm morphology analysis remains a critical component of reproductive health evaluation, as abnormal sperm morphology is strongly correlated with reduced fertility rates and poor assisted reproductive technology outcomes. Traditional manual analysis performed by embryologists is time-intensive, subjective, and prone to significant inter-observer variability, with studies reporting up to 40% disagreement between expert evaluators. This research presents a novel deep learning framework combining Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with ResNet50 architecture and advanced deep feature engineering (DFE) techniques for automated, objective sperm morphology classification.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We propose a hybrid architecture integrating ResNet50 backbone with CBAM attention mechanisms, enhanced by a comprehensive deep feature engineering pipeline. The framework incorporates multiple feature extraction layers (CBAM, GAP, GMP, pre-final) combined with 10 distinct feature selection methods including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Chi-square test, Random Forest importance, variance thresholding, and their intersections. Classification is performed using Support Vector Machines with RBF/Linear kernels and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms. The model was rigorously evaluated on two benchmark datasets: SMIDS (3000 images, 3-class) and HuSHeM (216 images, 4-class) using 5-fold cross-validation.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed framework achieved exceptional performance with test accuracies of 96.08 ± 1.2% on SMIDS dataset and 96.77 ± 0.8% on HuSHeM dataset using deep feature engineering, representing significant improvements of 8.08% and 10.41% respectively over baseline CNN performance. McNemar's test confirmed statistical significance ([Formula: see text]). The best configuration (GAP + PCA + SVM RBF) demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, including recent Vision Transformer and ensemble methods.<h4>Conclusions and clinical impact</h4>This research demonstrates the effectiveness of attention-based deep learning combined with sophisticated feature engineering for sperm morphology analysis. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing clinically interpretable results through Grad-CAM attention visualization. Clinical implications include: (1) standardized, objective fertility assessment reducing diagnostic variability, (2) significant time savings for embryologists (from 30-45 minutes to <1 minute per sample), (3) improved reproducibility across laboratories, and (4) potential for real-time analysis during assisted reproductive procedures, ultimately enhancing patient care and treatment outcomes in reproductive medicine.",Kılıç Ş,"School of Computer Science, CHART Laboratory, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.",PloS one,2025-09-10,10.1371/journal.pone.0330914,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40919956,Fully Endoscopic Microvascular Decompression for Hemifacial Spasm Using 2-Dimensional/3-Dimensional Endoscopy: Clinical Analysis of 204 Cases.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm (HFS) is commonly conducted under a microscope. We report a large series of fully endoscopic MVDs for HFS and describe our initial experience with 3-dimensional (3D) endoscopy.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical data of 204 patients with HFS who underwent fully endoscopic MVD using 2-dimensional (2D) and 3D endoscopy (191 and 13 patients, respectively) from July 2017 to October 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were grouped according to timing of surgery within the study period: early, middle, and late. The mean follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 3-87).<h4>Results</h4>At last follow-up, surgery had achieved cessation or significant reduction of spasms in 198 patients (97.1%). Complications immediately after surgery were as follows: facial weakness, 7 patients; hearing loss, 11 patients; tinnitus, 1 patient; infection, 1 patient; dysphagia, 1 patient; and cerebrospinal fluid leakage, 1 patient. The patients who experienced infection, dysphagia, and leakage recovered before discharge. Ten patients had complications that were present at last follow-up (1 tinnitus, 3 facial weakness, 6 hearing loss). The rate of complete or significant remission of spasms in the early, middle, and late groups was 95.6%, 97.1%, and 98.5%, respectively; the corresponding complication rates were 5.9%, 5.9%, and 2.9%, respectively. Compared with the 2D endoscope, the 3D endoscope provided subjectively enhanced stereoscopic vision and depth perception, which facilitated the operation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Fully endoscopic MVD for HFS offers wide visualization of the neurovascular conflict area and minimizes brain injury caused by retraction. Once technical proficiency is achieved, surgical outcomes are favorable and complications are low. Despite the drawbacks such as a slight sense of vertigo during use and high cost, the 3D endoscope provides a stereoscopic view.

40921102,Camera-assisted and navigated single-position prone transpsoas lateral lumbar interbody fusion: illustrative case.,"<h4>Background</h4>Single-position prone transpsoas lateral lumbar interbody fusion (PTP-LLIF) is an evolving minimally invasive surgery technique that merges the biomechanical and anatomical advantages of prone positioning with the LLIF approach. While PTP-LLIF enhances lumbar lordosis restoration and operative efficiency by eliminating patient repositioning, it presents unique ergonomic and visualization challenges for surgeons. This technical report describes a novel modification of the technique using the Teligen camera to improve intraoperative visualization and reduce surgeon fatigue.<h4>Observations</h4>The approach follows standard PTP-LLIF workflow with modifications allowing the use of retractor-mounted optical cameras and integrated navigation. The system enables real-time visualization of disc preparation and cage placement while minimizing reliance on repeated fluoroscopic imaging.<h4>Lessons</h4>Integration of the Teligen system improves ergonomic posture for the surgeon, reduces the frequency of radiation exposure, and provides continuous visual access for both the lead surgeon and the operative team. Enhanced intraoperative efficiency and teaching opportunities are also noted.

40926228,Construction of a nomogram for hypertriglyceridemic severe acute pancreatitis that includes metabolic indexes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Current scoring systems for hypertriglyceridaemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) severity are few and lack reliability. The present work focused on screening predicting factors for HTG-SAP, then constructing and validating the visualization model of HTG-AP severity by combining relevant metabolic indexes.<h4>Methods</h4>Between January 2020 and December 2024, retrospective clinical information for HTG-AP inpatients from Weifang People's Hospital was examined. CT scans of included patients were evaluated for muscle and fat parameters. To identify independent predictors of HTG-SAP, univariate regression, least absolute contraction and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and multivariable logistic regression were conducted. Meanwhile, the nomogram was created for model visualization, and the model was verified for accuracy, consistency, stability, and utility by calibration, clinical decision curve (DCA), as well as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.<h4>Results</h4>Altogether 244 HTG-AP patients were enrolled, and they were categorized as a severe group (N = 44) or a non-severe group (N = 200) in line with Atlanta classification criteria. The analysis showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum creatinine(Scr), visceral adipose tissue index (VATI), serum albumin(ALB), and triglyceride and glucose (TyG) index independently predicted the HTG-AP severity prediction model, and a nomogram was constructed for visualization, with an internally validated Harrell's consistency index (c-index) of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.943-0.989), besides, calibration curves, ROC, and DCA all revealed that the nomogram had good predictive ability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>LDH, Scr, VATI, ALB, and TyG independently predict HTG-SAP, and our constructed prediction model has high sensitivity and specificity, which can early identify HTG-AP severity, with a view to giving appropriate interventions to the patients in time, delaying the progression of the patients' conditions, and reducing the complications.",Wang Z; Liu Y; Zhang X; Wang C; Tian J; Zhao H; Tian Q; Qu H,"Department of Clinical Medical College, Shandong Second Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, 261053, China.",Lipids in health and disease,2025-09-09,10.1186/s12944-025-02702-7,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),acute pancreatitis; Severity; Nomogram; Early Prediction; Hypertriglyceridemic
40928630,Minimally invasive and standardized thoracoscopic surgery for stage III empyema using a variable-view rigid endoscope.,"Thoracoscopic surgery for stage III acute empyema is often limited by poor visualization and anatomical complexity. We developed a standardized, minimally invasive approach using a variable-view rigid endoscope and fixed port placement, regardless of disease extent or patient physique. The variable-view endoscope enabled a wide, adjustable field of view without moving the camera shaft, allowing safe access even in the confined thoracic space. This setup facilitated comprehensive adhesiolysis and decortication via a bidirectional approach by surgeons on both ventral and dorsal sides. Among 43 consecutive patients, all but one underwent successful thoracoscopic management, with favorable clinical outcomes and minimal complications.",Iizuka S; Oki T; Nakamura T,"Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital, 2-12-12, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 430-8558, Japan.",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2025-09-10,10.1007/s11748-025-02195-2,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Pleural; Empyema; Thoracic Surgery; video-assisted; Thoracoscopes
40940321,Label-free volumetric imaging of porcine kidney tissue over extended areas using dynamic MHz-OCT.,"Dynamic optical coherence tomography (dOCT) enables high-resolution, label-free 3D tissue imaging with functional contrast, offering a potential advancement in kidney transplant viability assessment. Currently, no widely accepted non-invasive method provides an objective evaluation of transplant viability, as conventional imaging lacks the resolution to assess microvascular integrity and cellular dynamics. However, the clinical use of available dOCT systems is limited by prolonged imaging times that hinder clear visualization of tissue dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper presents a swept-source 3.2 MHz-OCT system for dynamic, high-speed, extended-area imaging. The system integrates an optimized inter-volume scan protocol and a micrometer-precision linear robot, enabling extended‑scale tissue imaging over an area of about 2.6 × 2.6 mm<sup>2</sup>. Using freshly excised porcine kidney tissue, we demonstrate recent advancements and challenges in MHz-dOCT for kidney imaging. Identified anatomical features are thoroughly examined, compared across resolutions, and validated through histology to assess the system's clinical potential.",Burhan S; Göb M; Pieper M; Laedtke T; Grahl T; Münter M; Schulz-Hildebrandt H; Hüttmann G; König P; Huber R,"Institute of Biomedical Optics, Universität zu Lübeck, Peter-Monnik-Weg 4, 23562, Lübeck, Germany.",Scientific reports,2025-09-12,10.1038/s41598-025-15032-6,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40936409,Novel and unscrutinized immune entities of the zebrafish gut.,"The zebrafish model offers a unique opportunity to study gut immunity due to its diverse applicability within several fields of research, combined with an evolutionarily conserved immune system, transparency, and genetic tractability. This review highlights recent advances in understudied immune cell types in the zebrafish gut, emphasizing their potential to illuminate immune processes of the vertebrate immune system. The biological function of the gut is highly conserved in zebrafish, which makes them a relevant model to study intestinal immune cells with advanced molecular and imaging techniques that enable in vivo visualization of immune mechanisms and cell trajectories. Rodent and pig models have successfully contributed to our understanding of many aspects of the immune system, while zebrafish have so far been underestimated in their potential role in furthering our knowledge in this field. We suggest how future study directions can help elucidate the complex nature of gut immunity and highlight similarities between mammalian and zebrafish immune systems. Provided that immune cell functions are conserved, zebrafish can offer great opportunities for translational studies and have an important impact in improving human health.",Andersen-Civil AIS; Mantel M; Soh J; Mostowy S; Brugman S; Vanwalleghem GC,"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark.",FEBS letters,2025-09-12,10.1002/1873-3468.70161,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Zebrafish; Microbiota; Translational Research; Gut Immunity; Host–pathogen Interactions
40925997,Antibody-bottlebrush prodrug conjugates for targeted cancer therapy.,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are effective targeted therapeutics but are limited in their ability to incorporate less-potent payloads, varied drug mechanisms of action, different drug release mechanisms and tunable drug-to-antibody ratios. Here we introduce a technology to overcome these limitations called 'antibody-bottlebrush prodrug conjugates' (ABCs). An ABC consists of an IgG1 monoclonal antibody covalently conjugated to the terminus of a compact bivalent bottlebrush prodrug that has payloads bound through cleavable linkers and polyethylene glycol branches. This design enables the synthesis of ABCs with tunable average drug-to-antibody ratios up to two orders of magnitude greater than those of traditional ADCs. We demonstrate the functional flexibility and manufacturing efficiency of this technology by synthesizing more than 10 different ABCs targeting either HER2 or MUC1 using drugs with potencies spanning several orders of magnitude as well as imaging agents for ABC visualization and photocatalysts for proximity-based labeling of the ABC interactome. ABCs display high target engagement, high cell uptake and improved efficacy in tumor models compared to conventional HER2-targeted ADCs, suggesting promise for clinical translation.",Liu B; Nguyen HV; Jiang Y; Wang AX; Lensch V; Sun Z; Boyer ZH; Raftopoulos PA; Dai Y; MacNicol PL; Wang Y; Jyotsana N; Wang W; Bhagchandani S; Hemdev S; Shieh P; Kristufek SL; Boucher M; Downes M; Evans RM; MacMillan DWC; Johnson JA,"Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.",Nature biotechnology,2025-09-09,10.1038/s41587-025-02772-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40935303,Advances in optical imaging in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a leading cause of neurological disability, imposes a critical need for early and precise diagnosis due to its complex pathological heterogeneity, which directly impacts treatment efficacy and patient prognosis. Although conventional imaging techniques (e.g., CT, MRI) provide structural insights, their inherent limitations in molecular specificity, sensitivity for subtle lesions, and real-time dynamic monitoring necessitate the development of complementary approaches. Optical imaging, including fluorescence, bioluminescence, and photoacoustic imaging, have emerged as powerful tools, enabling non-invasive, real-time, and molecular-specific visualization of pathological cascades with high spatiotemporal resolution. In the field of TBI diagnosis, optical imaging has become a research hotspot. In this review, we systematically explore the mechanisms of optical imaging methods and discuss the latest advances in their use for TBI diagnosis and TBI biomarker identification, and further discusses the possible future development of optical imaging in early diagnosis of TBI. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: (1) Highlights the limitations of current clinical imaging (CT/MRI) in detecting traumatic brain injury (TBI).

40938431,Resection of thoracic meningioma with hoth augmented reality system: technical note and operative video.,"<h4>Background</h4>Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technology in the field of neurosurgery. It allows surgeons to view three-dimensional (3D) patient anatomy overlaid onto the surgical field in real time. In this technical report, we describe the preoperative and intraoperative use of the Hoth AR system for resection of a thoracic meningioma.<h4>Methods</h4>Prior to surgery, the 3D model of the patient's tumor and surrounding anatomy is rendered from the patient's preoperative imaging, and it is uploaded into the AR headset. Once the patient is positioned in the operating room, registration is performed by tracing reference points on the skin while wearing the headset. The surgeon wears the headset while operating, and they can toggle on-off and transparency of each component of the model using voice commands to best visualize the 3D rendering overlaid on the patient's anatomy.<h4>Results</h4>We provide a video case demonstrating the use of the Hoth AR system for resection of a thoracic meningioma. The system was able to register the model to the patient accurately in under 30 s. It was used to accurately plan the incision preoperatively, determine levels for laminectomy intraoperatively, and for precise localization of the tumor prior to opening the dura.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This case describes the clinical integration of a novel AR system for preoperative localization and intraoperative visualization during a resection of a thoracic meningioma. As AR systems continue to evolve and become more accessible, they are poised to become a standard tool in the surgical arsenal.",Ibrahim N; Shiino S; Nguyen K; Shapiro S; Janssen A; Dumont A,"Tulane Medical Center, Department of Neurosurgery, 131 S.

40944851,Dynamic functional examination of the peritoneal dialysis catheter using color Doppler ultrasound. In vitro technical evaluation and in vivo application.,"<h4>Background</h4>Peritoneal dialysis catheter malfunction compromises dialysis adequacy. Standard imaging methods in the case of peritoneal catheter malfunction include abdominal X-ray, fluoroscopic catheter peritoneography, and computed tomography. Ultrasound has only recently been utilized to evaluate the intraperitoneal part of the catheter. In clinical routine, catheter function is assessed by the time needed to fill or drain a defined quantity of peritoneal dialysis fluid. Visual functional testing of the catheter can be performed by fluoroscopy or by contrast-enhanced ultrasound. We developed and tested a color Doppler ultrasound technique for dynamic imaging of the peritoneal catheter based on signal generation by dialysis fluid flow.<h4>Methods</h4>The feasibility of the color Doppler approach was evaluated utilizing a phantom. Furthermore, the technique was applied in 28 peritoneal dialysis patients, most of whom presented peritoneal catheter malfunction.<h4>Results</h4>Color Doppler examination improved the catheter visualization, especially in cases in which the catheter is embedded between the intestinal loops. Furthermore, this technique highlighted catheter side hole occlusions by adhesions or intraluminal thrombi.

40940598,Illuminating the Uncinate: Advanced Indocyanine Green Fluorescence and Ultrasound-Guided Robotic Enucleation of a Pancreatic Insulinoma in a Challenging Position.,"Insulinoma is a rare, functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET) that typically presents with clinical manifestations associated with fasting hypoglycemia in accordance with Whipple's triad. Although most insulinomas have benign biological behavior, the severity of hypoglycemic symptoms necessitates prompt diagnosis and management. Surgical resection remains the treatment of choice, and parenchyma-sparing techniques, such as enucleation, are preferred when the tumor is solitary. However, when the tumor is located in anatomically challenging regions, the surgical approach can present significant difficulties, limiting the use of parenchyma-sparing surgery. We report the case of a 54-year-old female with an insulinoma localized to the uncinate process of the pancreas in a critical position due to its close proximity to the mesenteric vessels. The tumor was successfully managed with robotic enucleation using the da Vinci XI platform. Intraoperative imaging with ultrasound, complemented by indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging, provided real-time visualization of the hypervascular lesion and its relationship to nearby vascular structures, allowing for precise demarcation and safe resection. This case illustrates the advantages of combining advanced intraoperative imaging techniques with robotic surgery to achieve a parenchyma-sparing resection with minimal morbidity. The discussion highlights current literature and emerging evidence on the use of ICG and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence in pancreatic surgery, underscoring its potential to improve outcomes in the management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.",De Palma C; Delvecchio A; Ferraro V; Stasi M; Casella A; Filippo R; Caringi S; Calbi R; Inchingolo R; Longo FR; Troia M; Memeo R; Tedeschi M,"IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Pancreatic Surgery, Rozzano, Milan, Italy. cataldo.depalma@st.hunimed.eu.",Annals of surgical oncology,2025-09-12,10.1245/s10434-025-18310-9,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40928605,Prop scan versus roll scan: selection for cranial three-dimensional rotational angiography using in-house phantom and Figure of Merit as parameter.,"This study introduces a novel optimization framework for cranial three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA), combining the development of a brain equivalent in-house phantom with Figure of Merit (FOM) a quantitative evaluation method. The technical contribution involves the development of an in-house phantom constructed using iodine-infused epoxy and lycal resins, validated against clinical Hounsfield Units (HU). A customized head phantom was developed to simulate brain tissue and cranial vasculature for 3DRA optimization. The phantom was constructed using epoxy resin with 0.15-0.2% iodine to replicate brain tissue and lycal resin with iodine concentrations ranging from 0.65 to 0.7% to simulate blood vessels of varying diameters. The phantom materials validation was performed by comparing their HU values to clinical reference HU values from brain tissue and cranial vessels, ensuring accurate tissue simulation. The validated phantom was used to acquire images using cranial 3DRA protocols, specifically Prop-Scan and Roll-Scan. Image quality was assessed using Signal-Difference-to-Noise Ratio (SDNR), Dose-Area Product (DAP), and Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). Imaging efficiency was quantified using the Figure of Merit (FOM), calculated as SDNR<sup>2</sup>/DAP, to objectively compare the performance of two cranial 3DRA protocols. The task-based optimization showed that Roll-Scan consistently outperformed Prop-Scan across all vessel sizes and regions. Roll-Scan yields FOM values ranging from 183 to 337, while Prop-Scan FOM values ranged from 96 to 189. Additionally, Roll-Scan (0.27 lp/pixel) delivered better spatial resolution, as indicated by higher MTF 10% value than Prop-Scan (0.23 lp/pixel). Most notably, Roll-Scan consistently detecting 2 mm vessel structures among all regions of the phantom. This capability is clinically important in cerebral angiography, which is accurate visualization of small vessels, i.e. the Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA), Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA), and Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA). These findings highlight Roll-Scan as the superior protocol for brain interventional imaging, underscoring the significance of FOM as a comprehensive parameter for optimizing imaging protocols in clinical practice. The experimental results support the use of the Roll-Scan protocol as the preferred acquisition method for cerebral angiography in clinical practice. The analysis using FOM provides substantial and quantifiable evidence in determining the acquisition methods. Furthermore, the customized in-house phantom is recommended as a candidate to optimization tools for clinical medical physicists.",Hariyati I; Sulistyani A; Gregorius M; Aribowo H; Prawoto U; Yana DD; Salamah T; Lubis LE; Soejoko DS,"Department of Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, 16424, Indonesia.",Physical and engineering sciences in medicine,2025-09-10,10.1007/s13246-025-01632-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Optimization; Fom; Imaging Performance; 3D Angiography; In-house Phantom
40930817,Clinical Evaluation of Susceptibility-weighted MR Imaging for the Detection of Intramammary Micro- and Macrocalcifications in 70 Female Patients at 1.5T.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The ability to accurately detect and characterize intramammary micro- and macrocalcifications without ionized radiation has significant clinical implications for early breast cancer assessment. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the feasibility of detecting intramammary calcifications using 3D multi-echo gradient echo (ME-GRE) magnitude and true susceptibility-weighted images (tSWI) compared to digital mammography (DM) in patients with different breast sizes and densities of breast parenchyma at 1.5T.<h4>Methods</h4>Two board-certified radiologists evaluated digital mammograms of 70 patients and compared them to the corresponding SW-based images concerning detection of intramammary calcifications and determination of their sizes. The clinical performance of both SW-based techniques in accurately detecting and assessing intramammary calcifications was determined. In addition an interobserver agreement was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Compared to DM, visualization of calcification lesions using both SW-based techniques is influenced by: 1) Morphology (shape and homogeneity) of calcifications; 2) Spatial arrangement of calcifications. Closely adjacent calcifications may not be distinguishable in the SW-based images as individual lesions. Overlapping susceptibility effects resulted in a single, larger lesion; 3) The (in-phase or out-of-phase cycle) echo time value selected in the imaging protocol plays a crucial role in visualizing the lesions; and 4) Lesion size was overestimated by up to 2.0 mm when comparing SW-based techniques to DM. An almost perfect interobserver agreement was found for the analysis. Microcalcifications could not be visualized. A sensitivity of 13.0% and specificity of 99.7% for the diagnosis of macrocalcifications could be provided with both SW-based techniques.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings highlight the potentials and limitations of SW-based techniques at 1.5 T for characterizing intramammary micro- and macrocalcifications. The high specificity of SW-based techniques in combination with higher magnetic field strengths could revolutionize breast cancer screening and management.",Lebenatus A; Tesch K; Straub S; Strathmann EA; Bautz L; Schäfer KFW; Bauerschlag DO; Jansen O; Salehi Ravesh M,"Department of Radiology and Neuroradiology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.",Magnetic resonance in medical sciences : MRMS : an official journal of Japan Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,2025-09-10,10.2463/mrms.mp.2025-0037,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Susceptibility Weighted Imaging; Digital Mammography; True Susceptibility Weighted Imaging; Intramammary Micro- And Macrocalcifications
40944755,Feature-based multimodal 3D/2D and 3D/3D registration framework for pedicle screw registration and evaluation.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Accurate pedicle screw placement is crucial for ensuring safety during spine surgery. This study aims to develop and validate a feature-based 3D to 2D registration framework to integrate pre-operative MR with intra-operative X-ray images for estimating the pedicle screw trajectory and achieving robust 3D visualization. The method aims to overcome intensity mismatches and tissue non-correspondence issues inherent to multimodal registration.<h4>Methods</h4>A feature-based registration framework was proposed, leveraging vertebral endplates as key features due to their consistency after pedicle screw insertion. The segmented MR images were forward-projected and registered to intra-operative X-ray images using a binary image matching similarity measure, with optimization achieved through CMA-ES. Validation was performed by mapping the registered trajectory position onto pre-operative MR images and further evaluating the accuracy through 3D to 3D registration of pre-operative MR and post-operative CT images.<h4>Results</h4>The framework effectively estimated the pedicle screw trajectory by registering intra-operative images onto pre-operative MR, with errors consistently below 2.5 mm for entry point, endpoint, and directional trajectory. The 3D to 3D registration validated the accuracy, demonstrating precise alignment between trajectory positions across modalities.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed feature-based registration framework provides fast and accurate 3D trajectory information. This method improves surgical precision and offers robust evaluation metrics, making it a reliable tool for spine navigation and clinical diagnosis during pedicle screw placement procedures.",Kiran U; Anitha H; Bhat SN; Naik RR,"Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, 576104, India.","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",2025-09-13,10.1007/s00586-025-09342-6,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Vertebral Pose Estimation; Trajectory Error; 3D To 3D Registration; Pedicle Screw Registration; Vertebral Endplate Registration
40944627,Dual-Frequency HIFU-Activated Multifunctional Nanoparticles for Trimodal Synergistic Therapy and Immune Responses with Real-Time US/MRI Guidance.,"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been employed in clinical practice for tumor treatment via thermal ablation. However, the high energy requirements of HIFU raise safety concerns, and insufficient therapeutic efficacy can lead to potential tumor recurrence. To address these issues, we developed multifunctional theranostic nanoparticles (PFP@POMP@MnO<sub>2</sub>-Ce6 NPs) and utilized dual-frequency HIFU technology to enhance therapeutic efficiency at lower energy levels. This approach achieved efficient and rapid thermal/cavitation/sonodynamic synergistic therapy, leveraging long-term therapy through immune responses and precise monitoring via US/MRI dual-modal imaging. The NPs are composed of polymer micelles that encapsulate perfluoropentane (PFP), with their surface modified by MnO<sub>2</sub> and sonosensitizer Chlorin e6 (Ce6). The results indicated that dual-frequency HIFU irradiation triggered the vaporization of PFP within the NPs, enhancing both the thermal and cavitation effects of HIFU, which led to an increase in the area of thermal damage in the phantoms. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the NPs, when combined with dual-frequency HIFU, could achieve synergistic antitumor effects, inducing 94.1 ± 1.5% (<i>p</i> < 0.01) tumor cell death in vitro and ablation of directly treated tumors without recurrence in vivo. Most interestingly, the synergistic therapy suppressed the growth of distal tumors (93.4 ± 1.1% growth inhibition), indicating enhanced immune responses, which was further supported by immunohistochemical (IHC) results of a 69.3 ± 1.5% increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and a 61.2 ± 1.5% increase in F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration. It ensured the longevity of the treatment effects and reduced the likelihood of tumor recurrence. Moreover, the NPs' dual-modal imaging (US/MRI) capabilities provided real-time guidance and improved tumor visualization, confirming their utility as potent theranostic agents. This therapeutic approach, facilitated by multifunctional nanoparticles and in synergy with dual-frequency HIFU, provided precise imaging guidance, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and elicited an immune response, thereby effectively addressing the limitations inherent to traditional HIFU therapy.",Nan Z; Shi L; Liu H; Han X; Chen J; Wu D; Wan M; Feng Y,"The Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, People's Republic of China.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2025-09-13,10.1021/acsami.5c09753,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Immune responses; Synergistic Therapy; Dual-modal Imaging; Dual-frequency Hifu; Multifunctional Theranostic Nanoparticle

We used 2022 Medicare claims data to identify drug-specific beneficiary utilization. Medical claims with <i>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> diagnosis codes for each indication were evaluated to estimate relative indication-specific utilization. We examined published clinical guidelines to identify and propose therapeutic alternatives for each drug and the most prevalent, FDA-approved indication. For negotiation price benchmarks, we report (1) the list price, (2) the estimated net price after manufacturer discounts, (3) the minimum statutory discount, and (4) the ceiling of the MFP. All price benchmarks were estimated at the product level, for a 30-day equivalent dosing, using Medicare Part D dashboard and IQVIA data. We also estimated net prices for the proposed therapeutic alternatives.<h4>Results</h4>Four drugs were identified to have 1 (deutetrabenazine, linaclotide, and nintedanib-esylate) or no (rifaximin) therapeutic alternative. Eight of the 15 selected drugs will have the ceiling price set by the minimum statutory discount. Four products (acalabrutinib, semaglutide, linagliptin, and sitagliptin/metformin) will include therapeutic alternatives and MFPs from the first round of negotiation. The selection of therapeutic alternatives and estimation of price benchmarks by CMS will set the initial conditions for subsequent price negotiation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These analyses identify the likely ceiling price and various initial price offer scenarios for the second round of Medicare price negotiation.
