40240653,Machine learning approaches for assessing medication transfer to human breast milk.,"The human milk/plasma (M/P) drug concentration ratio is crucial in pharmacology, especially for breastfeeding mothers undergoing treatment. It determines the extent to which drugs ingested by the mother pass into breast milk, potentially affecting the infant. This study conducted a comprehensive evaluation of multiple machine learning algorithms to assess their effectiveness in predicting the M/P ratio. The dataset consists of 162 drugs and 11 predictor variables. M/P ratios were categorized into two groups of (0, 1) and (≥ 1), and a refined three-category system: (0, < 0.5), (0.5, < 1), and (≥ 1). The ML techniques utilized include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks. We implied the five-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for data visualization. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used in the KNN model selection to balance complexity and explanatory power. In our study, KNN achieved average accuracies of 79% for the two-category system and 60% for the three-category. Random Forest models show 77 and 64% average accuracy, respectively. SVM achieved similar results with 78 and 67%, while Neural Networks have the overall best result among the other models with average accuracies of 82 and 76% accuracy. The study highlights the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques in predicting M/P ratios, offering valuable insights for risk assessment during drug development. These predictive models can serve as a valuable tool for estimating drug transfer into breast milk, helping to bridge knowledge gaps in drug safety for lactating individuals. Further validation and refinement by incorporating larger datasets can enhance their reliability and applicability. Advancing these techniques can support safer medication use and informed clinical decision-making for lactating individuals.",Zhao Z; Zou P; Fang Y; Si T; Li Y; Yi B; Zhang T,"School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, SUNY-Binghamton University, PO Box 6000, Binghamton, NY, 13902, USA.",Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,2025-04-16,10.1007/s10928-025-09972-9,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Pharmacokinetics; Breast milk; Machine Learning; Milk To Plasma Concentration Ratio (M/p Ratio)

39537359,Multisample motif discovery and visualization for tandem repeats.,"Tandem repeats (TRs) occupy a significant portion of the human genome and are a source of polymorphisms due to variations in sizes and motif compositions. Some of these variations have been associated with various neuropathological disorders, highlighting the clinical importance of assessing the motif structure of TRs. Moreover, assessing the TR motif variation can offer valuable insights into evolutionary dynamics and population structure. Previously, characterizations of TRs were limited by short-read sequencing technology, which lacks the ability to accurately capture the full TR sequences. As long-read sequencing becomes more accessible and can capture the full complexity of TRs, there is now also a need for tools to characterize and analyze TRs using long-read data across multiple samples. In this study, we present MotifScope, a novel algorithm for the characterization and visualization of TRs based on a de novo <i>k</i>-mer approach for motif discovery. Comparative analysis against established tools reveals that MotifScope can identify a greater number of motifs and more accurately represent the underlying repeat sequences. Moreover, MotifScope has been specifically designed to enable motif composition comparisons across assemblies of different individuals, as well as across long-read sequencing reads within an individual, through combined motif discovery and sequence alignment. We showcase potential applications of MotifScope in diverse fields, including population genetics, clinical settings, and forensic analyses.",Zhang Y; Hulsman M; Salazar A; Tesi N; Knoop L; van der Lee S; Wijesekera S; Krizova J; Kamsteeg EJ; Holstege H,"Section Genomics of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Aging, Department of Clinical Genetics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",Genome research,2025-04-14,10.1101/gr.279278.124,7.0,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract)",
39331546,Effect of White Matter Uncertainty Visualization in Neurosurgical Decision-Making.,"Fiber tracking is a powerful technique that provides insight into the brain's white matter structure. Despite its potential, the inherent uncertainties limit its widespread clinical use. These uncertainties potentially hamper the clinical decisions neurosurgeons have to make before, during, and after the surgery. Many techniques have been developed to visualize uncertainties; however, there is limited evidence to suggest whether these uncertainty visualization influences neurosurgical decision-making. In this article, we evaluate the hypothesis that uncertainty visualization in fiber tracking influences neurosurgeon's decisions and confidence in their decisions. For this purpose, we designed a user study through an online interactive questionnaire and evaluate the influence of uncertainty visualization in neurosurgical decision-making. The results of this study emphasize the importance of uncertainty visualization in clinical decision-making by highlighting the influence of different intervals of uncertainty visualization in critical clinical decisions.",Siddiqui F; Brouwers HB; Rutten GJ; Hollt T; Vilanova A,,IEEE computer graphics and applications,2025-04-14,10.1109/mcg.2024.3462926,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",
40239236,BenchXAI: Comprehensive benchmarking of post-hoc explainable AI methods on multi-modal biomedical data.,"The increasing digitalization of multi-modal data in medicine and novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms opens up a large number of opportunities for predictive models. In particular, deep learning models show great performance in the medical field. A major limitation of such powerful but complex models originates from their 'black-box' nature. Recently, a variety of explainable AI (XAI) methods have been introduced to address this lack of transparency and trust in medical AI. However, the majority of such methods have solely been evaluated on single data modalities. Meanwhile, with the increasing number of XAI methods, integrative XAI frameworks and benchmarks are essential to compare their performance on different tasks. For that reason, we developed BenchXAI, a novel XAI benchmarking package supporting comprehensive evaluation of fifteen XAI methods, investigating their robustness, suitability, and limitations in biomedical data. We employed BenchXAI to validate these methods in three common biomedical tasks, namely clinical data, medical image and signal data, and biomolecular data. Our newly designed sample-wise normalization approach for post-hoc XAI methods enables the statistical evaluation and visualization of performance and robustness. We found that the XAI methods Integrated Gradients, DeepLift, DeepLiftShap, and GradientShap performed well over all three tasks, while methods like Deconvolution, Guided Backpropagation, and LRP-α1-β0 struggled for some tasks. With acts such as the EU AI Act the application of XAI in the biomedical domain becomes more and more essential. Our evaluation study represents a first step towards verifying the suitability of different XAI methods for various medical domains.",Metsch JM; Hauschild AC,"Institute for Medical Informatics, University Medical Center Göttingen, Germany.

40239232,Portable ECG and PCG wireless acquisition system and multiscale CNN feature fusion Bi-LSTM network for coronary artery disease diagnosis.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of mortality, especially among aging populations, making timely and accurate diagnosis essential. In this work, a portable wireless device powered by artificial intelligence for CAD detection is proposed, which synchronously captures electrocardiograms (ECG) and phonocardiograms (PCG) signals and transmits them for real-time analysis and visualization. To ensure the reliability of the acquired signals, a Hidden Semi Markov model is applied to validate data quality. Then, a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) feature fusion model extracts critical features from the PCG and ECG signals. All these features and signal information are later processed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network. Our network achieves impressive metrics and maintains reliable performance in practical tests. This straightforward diagnostic system offers a practical and technically feasible solution for the effective diagnosis of CAD, leveraging advanced neural network architectures for robust clinical application.",Lin J; Wang S; Xuan W; Chen D; Liu F; Chen J; Xia S; Dong S; Luo J,"Ministry of Education Key Lab. of RF Circuits and Systems, College of Electronics & Information Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China.",Computers in biology and medicine,2025-04-15,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110202,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); data(abstract),CAD; Wireless Device; Bi-lstm; Multiscale Cnn Feature Fusion; Pcg And Ecg
40235327,Molecular signatures of endodontitis and pulpal inflammation: a comprehensive gene expression and multi-parameter analysis using GSE77459 microarray data.,"Pulpal inflammation remains a significant endodontic challenge requiring improved molecular understanding for effective diagnosis and treatment. Current diagnostic methods largely depend on clinical assessments, necessitating molecular-level insights. This study aimed to analyze comprehensive gene expression profiles in pulpitis to identify potential diagnostic markers and understand underlying molecular mechanisms. We analyzed the GSE77459 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus, comprising twelve pulpal tissue samples (six irreversible pulpitis and six normal controls). Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneTitan Multichannel Instrument. Pain assessment utilized visual analog scale (VAS) readings, with values >30mm indicating moderate to severe pain. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using GEO2R, implementing a false discovery rate of 5%. Statistical significance was evaluated through adjusted p-values, log2 fold changes, and comprehensive visualization techniques including Volcano plots, Mean-Difference plots, and UMAP analysis. The analysis identified significant expression changes between inflamed and normal pulp tissues. Three genes showed notable upregulation: SNORD113-3 (log2FC: +0.71), RN5S290 (log2FC: +0.70), and SH3GL2 (log2FC: +0.67). Key downregulated genes included IGHV3-72 (log2FC: -1.66), IGKV1-5 (log2FC: -1.57), and IGHD (log2FC: -1.57). UMAP analysis revealed distinct clustering patterns between disease and control samples, while maintaining proximal positioning, indicating subtle yet consistent transcriptional differences. Statistical analysis showed that 62% of differentially expressed genes had significant adjusted p-values (<1e-8), with 25% exhibiting absolute log2FC values >1.2. This study reveals specific molecular signatures associated with pulpal inflammation, particularly highlighting the downregulation of immunoglobulin-related genes and upregulation of RNA processing factors. These findings provide potential molecular markers for pulpitis diagnosis and suggest new directions for therapeutic interventions in endodontic treatment.",Boreak N,"Department of Restorative Dental Sciences, College of Dentistry, Jazan University, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia. nboraak@jazanu.edu.sa.","Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",2025-04-15,10.14715/cmb/2025.71.3.12,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
40241005,Global burden of TBL cancer in older adults: the role of dietary factors (1990-2021).,"<h4>Background</h4>The incidence and mortality rates of trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers (TBL) continue to rise globally. Despite a trend of increasing cases among younger populations, the majority of patients with TBL remain concentrated in the 50 + age group. A comprehensive analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database reveals that fruit-deficient diets significantly contribute to both mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with TBL, particularly in patients aged 55 and older, thus posing a major global health challenge. This highlights the critical need to address the burden of this dietary risk factor in older populations. Leveraging the unparalleled value of GBD research in assessing health impacts, this study emphasizes the importance of mitigating the influence of poor dietary habits on elderly populations. The goal is to support informed public health decisions and strategies that can advance global health outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Between 1990 and 2021, this study systematically analyzed key indicators for patients with TBL aged 55 + , including morbidity, mortality, DALYs, age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs), age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs), and age-standardized DALYs (ASDRs). A thorough risk association analysis was conducted regarding the role of fruit-poor diets in TBL incidence. Data visualization and graphing were performed using JD_GBDR (V2.32) to explore disease characteristics and risk factors, enabling rigorous analysis of the impact of dietary patterns on TBL outcomes in this demographic.<h4>Results</h4>From 1990 to 2021, the global incidence of TBL has shown a marked increase in individuals aged 55 and older. By 2021, cases are projected to reach 2.02 million, with deaths rising to 1.8 million. Over the past 30 years, morbidity has surged by 116.82%, mortality by 99.88%, and DALYs by 80.56%. Notably, within the TBL patient group aged over 55, insufficient fruit intake has emerged as a key factor, contributing to 56,583 deaths-a 39.33% increase in mortality since 1990-and 1,200,556 DALYs, reflecting a 26.48% rise. These figures underscore the significant role of inadequate fruit intake in the disease progression of older patients with TBL, directly influencing mortality rates and DALY outcomes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study reveals an overall upward trajectory in global morbidity, mortality, and DALYs among patients with TBL aged 55 and older between 1990 and 2021. The growing impact of inadequate fruit intake on both mortality and disability-adjusted life years highlights the severity of this risk. Regional variations may occur due to local factors, including environment, healthcare access, and economic conditions. This research offers valuable insights into the global burden and distinct risk factors of TBL in older populations, with particular emphasis on the influence of dietary factors.

40249068,Feasibility of Qualitative Evaluation and Quantitative T2 Mapping of Peripheral Nerves and Muscles Using GRAPPATINI.,"<h4>Background</h4>Quantitative T2 mapping holds promise for evaluating peripheral nerve and muscle disorders, but current methods lack speed and diagnostic feasibility. As a proof of concept, T2 mapping may be applied to assess the abnormality of the common peroneal nerve (CPN), leading to denervation of the tibialis anterior muscle and subsequent foot drop.<h4>Purpose</h4>To evaluate the GRAPPATINI sequence (a combination of generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition [GRAPPA] and model-based accelerated relaxometry by iterative non-linear inversion [MARTINI]) for qualitative assessment and quantitative T2 mapping in patients with foot drop. We hypothesized that GRAPPATINI would yield comparable qualitative image quality to conventional T2-weighted (T2w) turbo spin echo (TSE) while detecting T2 differences between abnormal and normal nerves and muscles.<h4>Study type</h4>Prospective, cross-sectional study.<h4>Population</h4>27 subjects (13 females; mean age: 54.4 years; range: 17-85 years) with clinical suspicion or diagnosis of foot drop.<h4>Field strength/sequence</h4>3-Tesla, with GRAPPATINI T2 mapping (spin echo) and T2w-TSE Dixon for unilateral MRI of the knee region.<h4>Assessment</h4>Three radiologists, blinded to the sequence type and clinical data, evaluated nerve and muscle visualization, diagnostic confidence, and abnormal signal detection. Quantitative T2 values were measured in six manually segmented muscles and in the CPN and tibial nerve.<h4>Statistical tests</h4>Wilcoxon rank sum tests compared T2 values between abnormal and normal muscles/nerves (p < 0.05 indicates statistical significance). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) assessed interobserver agreement.<h4>Results</h4>Qualitative scores for nerve visualization, muscle visualization, and diagnostic confidence were similar between GRAPPATINI and T2w-Dixon (p = 1.0). T2 values were significantly higher in all abnormal versus normal muscles (66.5 vs. 45.7 ms) and in all abnormal versus normal nerves (66.8 vs. 60.5 ms).<h4>Data conclusion</h4>GRAPPATINI provided comparable qualitative image quality to T2w imaging while enabling quantitative T2 mapping to detect abnormalities in muscles and nerves in patients with foot drop.<h4>Evidence level</h4>2.<h4>Technical efficacy</h4>Stage 2.",Lu AZ; Lin Y; Hilbert T; Igbinoba Z; Shakoor D; Cai X; Sneag DB; Tan ET,"Department of Radiology and Imaging, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York, USA.",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,2025-04-18,10.1002/jmri.29803,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Peripheral Neuropathy; Foot Drop; Common Peroneal Nerve; T2 Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Neurography; Grappatini

40251373,Comparative analysis of indocyanine green dosages for optimal fluorescence imaging in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of different doses of Indocyanine Green (ICG) for fluorescence imaging during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, specifically between 0.5 to 3 h, to determine the optimal dose that would enhance clinical practice. A total of 80 patients with benign gallbladder diseases were enrolled fluorescence-guided laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to four groups based on the dose of ICG administered (n = 20 each): 0.25 mg, 0.50 mg, 1.00 mg, and 2.50 mg. Key clinical data were collected during the perioperative period, focusing on the delineation of the liver, identification of the cystic duct-common bile duct junction, and fluorescence intensity contrast analysis. The effectiveness of extrahepatic bile duct visualization was evaluated subjectively by three experienced hepatobiliary surgeons via surgical videos and images, categorized as ""excellent,"" ""good,"" or ""poor."" Successful fluorescence imaging was achieved in all patients without the requiring conversion to open surgery. Significant differences were observed among the four groups in several metrics: intraoperative blood loss, bile duct identification time, fluorescence intensity contrast values, and the number of cases rated ""excellent"" by the surgeons (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed for the remaining statistical indicators (P > 0.05). The findings based on the data suggest that a dose of 0.25 mg ICG within the 0.5-3 h window is optimal, yielding the highest fluorescence contrast between the extrahepatic bile duct and liver while garnering the best subjective evaluations.

40245024,Exploring mobility patterns and social health of older Canadians living at home to inform decision aids about housing: A mixed-methods study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Many tools support housing decisions for older adults but often overlook mobility patterns and social health. We explored these factors in older Canadians living at home to inform housing decisions.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a mixed-methods study with 20 older adults (65+) from Quebec and Alberta living independently or in senior residences with outdoor mobility. Data collection included sociodemographic information, GPS tracking, walking interviews, daily journals, and in-depth interviews. Data from interviews, which explored physical and social assets and barriers to social health and mobility, were analyzed using deductive content analysis in NVivo 12. GPS data were subjected to spatial analysis in QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) to map activity spaces and mobility patterns by the number and distance of activities, activity types, and modes of transportation. Daily journals were transcribed into an Excel spreadsheet and compared with GPS data. Overall analysis was guided hierarchically by qualitative data, utilizing verbatim narratives and visualization (activity space maps) to illustrate data convergence.<h4>Results</h4>Among 20 participants, 14 completed all activities, including GPS trackers. GPS maps showed participants mostly left home to drive for shopping or walking. Over 14 days, participants made an average of 10.4 (±5.8) trips and traveled 186.9 km (±130.4), averaging 16.8 km (±29.8) per day. Transportation modes included car (n=9), walking (n=5), and bus (n=2). Daily journals revealed that participants typically traveled alone. Interviews identified physical assets as libraries and supermarkets (n=10), while social assets were family support when desired (n=13) neighborhood familiarity (n=14), both contributing to social health.

40232895,"Efficient, Robust and Accurate CNN Predictor for Neuronal Activation in Directional Deep Brain Stimulation.","The programming of clinical deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems involves numerous combinations of stimulation parameters, such as stimulus amplitude, pulse width, and frequency. As more complex electrode designs, such as directional electrodes, are introduced, the traditional trial-and-error approach to manual DBS programming becomes increasingly impractical. Visualization of the volume of tissue activated (VTA) can assist in selecting stimulation parameters by showing the direct effects of DBS on neural tissue. However, the standard method for VTA calculation, which involves modeling biological nerve fibers, is highly time-consuming and limits clinical applicability. In this study, we used finite element models (FEM) of implanted DBS systems to compute electric fields and obtained a large dataset of axonal responses under electrical stimulation using multicompartment cable models. We then trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to replace the cable models. The CNN model's performance in calculating VTA was evaluated across various electrode configurations and stimulation parameters, and compared with existing activation function (AF) methods. The CNN model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.032V in predicting nerve fiber activation thresholds, demonstrating greater stability and accuracy in VTA prediction compared to the AF method. Additionally, the CNN reduced computation time by five orders of magnitude compared to standard axonal modeling methods. We demonstrate that the CNN-based neural fiber predictor can quickly, accurately, and robustly predict neural activation responses to DBS, thereby improving the efficiency of DBS programming.",Wang S; Ma R; Yuan Q; Li H; Jiang C,,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2025-04-15,10.1109/tnsre.2025.3561122,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40242252,The Association of Liver Enzymes With Acute Cholecystitis Diagnosed Using the Tokyo Criteria in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia: A Retrospective Case-Control Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Acute cholecystitis, an inflammation of the gallbladder, is often triggered by gallstones but can also result from ischemia, motility issues, chemical harm, and microbial infections. This condition can present with fever, nausea, right upper quadrant pain, and tenderness, influenced by various risk factors including age, gender, genetics, obesity, diet, and lifestyle.<h4>Aim</h4>This retrospective case-control study investigates the relationship between liver enzymes and acute cholecystitis in patients diagnosed based on Tokyo criteria in Alahsa, Saudi Arabia, from April 2016 to December 2023.<h4>Methods</h4>The study included 504 participants, with 249 cases of acute cholecystitis and 255 controls without cholecystitis, collected from King Fahad Hospital's medical records. Inclusion criteria were patients above 18 years old diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and availability of liver enzyme data. Data were analysed using SPSS version 21, employing descriptive analysis, Pearson Chi-Square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, box-plot visualization, Spearman correlation analysis, and ROC curve analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The mean age was similar between cases (39.9 ± 15.3 years) and controls (40.1 ± 13.9 years). Significant differences were found in gender distribution and BMI. ALT and ALP levels were significantly higher in cases compared to controls (<i>p</i> = 0.002 and <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively). The WBC count was also significantly higher in cases (<i>p</i> = 0.001). ROC curve analysis indicated that ALT and ALP had good discriminant ability to predict acute cholecystitis. Multiple hierarchical logistic regression showed that higher levels of ALT and ALP were significant predictors for acute cholecystitis, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.21 and 1.24, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Elevated ALT and ALP levels are significant predictors of acute cholecystitis, demonstrating the importance of liver enzymes in the diagnosis and management of this condition.

While most meningiomas are benign, a significant subset recurs postoperatively, presenting substantial treatment challenges. BAP1 gene inactivation has been suggested as a marker for aggressive meningiomas, although its precise molecular and clinical roles remain poorly understood.<h4>Methods</h4>To comprehensively investigate BAP1-altered meningiomas, we used six meningiomas with known BAP1 alterations as a discovery set. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of these samples, along 11,151 reference meningiomas, identified a distinct molecular cluster (n = 42) using unsupervised visualization approaches. These tumors were further characterized by DNA/RNA sequencing, histopathological examination, and a retrospective review of clinical data, compared to reference meningioma cohorts, providing a thorough characterization of this rare tumor subtype.<h4>Results</h4>Our integrative analysis revealed BAP1-altered meningiomas as a distinct CNS tumor subtype, characterized by recurrent loss of chromosome 3p21 and driven by various BAP1-inactivating alterations. Although rhabdoid morphology is present in some cases, it is not exclusive and should not be used as a grading criterion. Progression-free survival analysis showed a median of 21 months (95% CI: 12-NA), with a 2-year overall survival rate of 79% (95% CI: 60%-100%), highlighting the aggressive nature of these tumors. Gene expression profiling revealed upregulation of PRC target genes, dysregulated Polycomb signaling, and elevated expression in several cellular and growth factor pathways.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BAP1-altered meningiomas represent a distinct and aggressive CNS tumor subtype associated with PRC dysregulation and recurrent 3p chromosome loss. These findings support the designation ""meningioma, BAP1-altered.""",Sievers P; Arora S; Hielscher T; Savran D; Schrimpf D; Banan R; Vonhören D; Pusch S; Sill M; Appay R; Wirsching HG; Hortobagyi T; Dohmen H; Acker T; Kohlhof-Meinecke P; Schweizer L; Wefers AK; Harter PN; Hartmann C; Beschorner R; Schittenhelm J; Behling F; Tabatabai G; Mawrin C; Snuderl M; Maas SLN; Wesseling P; Brandner S; Korshunov A; Ratliff M; Krieg SM; Wick W; Jones DTW; Pfister SM; Holland EC; von Deimling A; Szulzewsky F; Sahm F,"Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.",Neuro-oncology,2025-04-18,10.1093/neuonc/noaf105,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Meningioma; Rhabdoid; Bap1; Chromosome 3P Loss; Polycomb Signaling
40232912,A Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Region-Specific Beamformer for Sparse Arrays 3D Ultrasound Imaging.,"Sparse arrays offer several advantages over other element reduction techniques for 3D ultrasound imaging. However, the large inter-element spacing in these arrays results in high sidelobe-related artifacts, which significantly degrade image quality and limit their application in 3D ultrasound imaging. Adaptive beamformers have been proposed to mitigate sidelobe-related artifacts, but they often degrade speckle texture quality, resulting in unnaturally dark images. To overcome these limitations, we propose RSB-Net, a region-specific beamformer based on deep reinforcement learning. RSB-Net adaptively selects the most suitable beamformer for each pixel of the image, applying adaptive beamforming in regions dominated by sidelobe artifacts and delay-and-sum beamforming in regions where speckle texture should be preserved. The effectiveness of RSB-Net was validated on both simulated and experimental synthetic transmit aperture RF datasets with a new designed sparse array prototype. On simulated data, RSB-Net achieved significant gains, with improvements of 52.81 dB in contrast ratio and 0.65 in generalized contrast-to-noise ratio compared to DAS beamforming. In experimental tissue-mimicking phantom data, RSB-Net demonstrated similar performance, achieving gains of 51.01 dB and 0.64 respectively. These results highlight the potential of RSB-Net as a robust and effective solution for high-quality B-mode 3D ultrasound imaging using 2D sparse arrays, advancing the standardization of 3D ultrasound in clinical settings by enhancing anatomical visualization, reducing operator dependency, and improving measurement accuracy for lesions and calcifications.",Tamraoui M; Liebgott H; Roux E,,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2025-04-15,10.1109/tuffc.2025.3560872,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40240558,The value of MR neurography in assessing lesions of the thoracic dorsal root ganglia in patients with zoster-associated pain.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the imaging characteristics of the thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in patients with zoster-associated pain (ZAP) using magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and its correlation with disease stages and serological marker.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-six consecutive ZAP patients with different disease stages (acute herpes neuralgia, subacute herpes neuralgia, and postherpetic neuralgia) and thirteen healthy subjects were scanned on a 3-T MR scanner for thoracic DRG visualization. The T<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>12</sub> DRG for each ZAP patient were divided into three groups (prominent affected segment, rash distribution segment, and non-rash distribution segment). The volume and T2 signal intensity (SI) of thoracic DRG were measured and compared. The visual analog scale (VAS) and serological data were also recorded.<h4>Results</h4>The volume ratio of prominent affected thoracic DRG in ZAP patients was larger than that in non-rash distribution segment of ZAP patients and that in the healthy group, respectively (both p < 0.05). The volume ratio of affected DRG in the acute herpes neuralgia and subacute herpes neuralgia group was both higher than that in the postherpetic neuralgia group (both p < 0.05). For T2 SI, no differences were found among three disease stages. The ESR index was the only parameter associated with volume ratio of prominent affected DRG segment (r = 0.48, p = 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>MRN is able to visualize and identify morphological changes of thoracic DRG of ZAP patients. The imaging characteristics of affected thoracic DRG exhibit differences across different disease stages, which was associated with ESR index in ZAP patients.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Magnetic resonance neurography is able to detect the abnormal imaging features of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in zoster-associated pain patients.

40251074,The spatial distribution of mortality in a large metropolis: A methodology for identifying geographical patterns and contributing factors.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The distribution of mortality in large urban areas, such as major metropolises, is normally highly heterogeneous. Disadvantaged populations often present distinct health patterns that might be neglected by studies that focus on privileged areas of the city. Understanding the varied causes of death across city regions can greatly aid public health management and inform evidence-based policies.<h4>Study design</h4>Retrospective observational study.<h4>Methods</h4>In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines statistical analysis, clustering, and geographical visualization to analyze mortality patterns in large metropolises. It determines clusters of districts based on mortality profiles and identifies deviations from expected death rates considering demographic factors like age profile and Human Development Index (HDI).<h4>Results</h4>We applied the method to the city of São Paulo, analyzing 376,452 deaths across five years. The method could identify four clusters within the city, each with different characteristics regarding the causes of death. Unsurprisingly, these clusters are highly correlated with the district's HDI and age profile. However, the method identifies deviations from expected death rates based on HDI and age, potentially indicating deficiencies in public health services in specific regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed methodology provides policymakers with tools to identify regions where causes of death exceed expected values for the population demography. It also offers insights into mortality patterns and their association with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, enabling the development of targeted healthcare strategies to improve overall public health outcomes.",Martinelli G; Kon F; de Camargo RY,"Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of São Paulo, Brazil.",Public health,2025-04-17,10.1016/j.puhe.2025.03.017,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Mortality; Geostatistics; Spatial distribution; Clustering; Evidence-based Public Policy

40223504,"Gross anatomy, computed tomographic contrast tenography, and needle endoscopy of the equine medial digital flexor tendon sheath.","<h4>Objective</h4>To investigate the computed tomography (CT) and gross anatomy of the equine medial digital flexor tendon sheath (MDFTS), and the endoscopic anatomy and approach to the MDFTS.<h4>Study design</h4>Ex vivo experimental study and one clinical case.<h4>Sample population</h4>Twelve clinically normal cadaveric hindlimbs.<h4>Methods</h4>Dissection, native and contrast CT scans were conducted to evaluate the anatomy of the MDFTS. Based on these findings, the portal locations for the endoscopic approaches were determined. Six hindlimbs were used in the pilot phase and another six limbs were selected for the main study. Endoscopic images were reviewed by three observers for the quality of visualization of intrasynovial structures during endoscopy.<h4>Results</h4>Intrasynovial structures that could consistently be identified during dissection and CT examination included the mesotenon in the proximal recess and two synovial plicae surrounding the medial digital flexor tendon. Communication between MDFTS and tarsal sheath varied among individual horses. Two portals were necessary to visualize the complete length of the MDFTS. Endoscopic entry was possible with both a needle scope and a conventional arthroscope; however, endoscopic examination was only feasible with the needle scope. The aforementioned intrasynovial structures could also be visualized endoscopically. One clinical case is presented with septic tenosynovitis due to a laceration with penetration of the MDFTS.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Endoscopic examination of the MDFTS is possible with the use of a needle scope.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>Endoscopic lavage of the MDFTS might be indicated in cases of septic tenosynovitis of the MDFTS and/or tarsal sheath.",Kerbert MP; Delling U; Verhaar N,"Clinic for Horses, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany.",Veterinary surgery : VS,2025-04-14,10.1111/vsu.14263,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40247329,Impact of preoperative pleural effusion on ultrasound- and pressure-guided thoracic paravertebral block: a prospective observational study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the impact of preoperative pleural effusion on the ultrasound visualization of the paravertebral space (PVS), thoracic paravertebral nerve block administered by anesthesiologists, and to investigate whether ultrasound combined with pressure guidance can assist in locating the paravertebral space in patients with pleural effusion.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective observational study enrolled patients undergoing thoracic surgery at Beijing Jishuitan Hospital between September 2021 and September 2022. Patients were categorized into two groups based on preoperative CT findings: the pleural effusion group (n = 40) and the non-pleural effusion group (n = 40). Prior to the induction of general anesthesia, all patients were placed in a lateral position. Thoracic paravertebral nerve block (TPVB) was administered using ultrasound guidance combined with pressure monitoring, with a 20 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine.<h4>Results</h4>Parameters recorded included the duration of puncture and ultrasound pre-scan for TPVB, the ultrasound image definition score of the PVS, the pressure in the external intercostal muscle and PVS, and additional relevant indicators. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured before anesthesia induction, post-induction, and during skin incision. Compared to the non-pleural effusion group, the pleural effusion group demonstrated prolonged ultrasound pre-scan and puncture durations. The PVS definition score, the ventral displacement of the pleura, and the accuracy of resident anesthesiologists in identifying the PVS were all significantly lower in the pleural effusion group (p < 0.05). Compared to non-pleural effusion group, the pleural effusion group had significantly higher pressure in PVS. In the pleural effusion group, the pressure in PVS was significantly lower than that in external intercostal muscle (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in MAP and HR between the two groups before anesthesia induction, post-induction and during skin incision (p > 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Preoperative pleural effusion is associated with reduced clarity of ultrasound visualization of the PVS, and extended procedural durations for anesthesiologists, thereby increasing the complexity of TPVB. Pressure detection during TPVB implementation can assist in locating the position of the puncture needle. For anesthesiologists with less experience, TPVB should be carefully performed in patients with preoperative pleural effusion.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The trial was prospectively registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under registration number ChiCTR2100050582, on August 30, 2021.",Zhao Y; Yu S; Zhang D; Zheng S; Cai N; Zhang Q; Wang G,"Department of Anesthesiology, Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Xinjiekou No. 31 East Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100035, China.",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,2025-04-17,10.1186/s13019-025-03437-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Pleural effusion; Pressure Measurement; Paravertebral Block; Regional Block; Ultrasound-guided
40184524,Focused ultrasound: focused on tremor.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has emerged as a leading noninvasive therapy for tremor, offering a precise, lesion-based alternative to deep brain stimulation (DBS) and traditional lesioning techniques. By using phased ultrasound arrays to focus energy at intracranial targets, MRgFUS allows for real-time visualization and monitoring, improving safety and efficacy. Initially developed for essential tremor (ET), MRgFUS-VIM-thalamotomy has gained widespread acceptance and is now a first-line option for tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (TDPD) and other tremor syndromes.<h4>Areas covered</h4>This review discusses the fundamental physics of focused ultrasound, key anatomical targets, and the clinical application of MRgFUS thalamotomy, pallidotomy, and subthalamotomy. Skull density ratio (SDR) and energy efficiency are highlighted as crucial factors affecting treatment outcomes. The evolution of MRgFUS as a bilateral treatment, along with the exploration of novel targets such as the pallidothalamic tract, is examined. Additionally, we discuss advancements in FUS neuromodulation, which could complement lesioning by providing temporary or reversible symptom relief.<h4>Expert opinion</h4>MRgFUS is poised to further revolutionize tremor treatment with frameless technology, staged bilateral procedures, and the integration of neuromodulation. Future developments may allow for precise, adaptive therapies that enhance both efficacy and patient experience.",Davidson B; Lozano AM,"Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.",Expert review of medical devices,2025-04-17,10.1080/17434440.2025.2489493,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Tremor; Parkinson’s Disease; Neuromodulation; Lesions; Focused ultrasound; Pallidotomy; Thalamotomy; Subthalamotomy
40231289,Interaction Between HAQ-STING Mutation and COPA: Protection Against COPA Syndrome.,"<h4>Background</h4>COPA syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory disorder caused by mutations in the COPA gene, leading to immune dysregulation and inflammatory pathology. The HAQ variant of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) allele has been identified as a protective factor against disease manifestation. Understanding the molecular interaction between HAQ-STING and COPA is critical for uncovering potential therapeutic strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>This study utilized AlphaFold2 Multimer (AF2M) (DeepMind, London, UK) an extension of AlphaFold2 designed to predict the structures of protein complexes (multimers), to analyze the structural interaction between COPA, STING, and HAQ-STING. PyMOL (Schrödinger, Inc., New York, USA) was used for molecular visualization and analysis of conformational differences in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Structural alignment and binding pocket analysis were conducted to assess the potential impact of HAQ-STING on COPA function. Molecular docking studies were conducted with AutoDock Vina Extended (OneAngstrom, Grenoble, France).<h4>Results</h4>AF2M analysis revealed that HAQ-STING causes a 90-degree rotational shift in its binding orientation to COPA compared to STING, inducing significant conformational rearrangements. The interaction alters COPA's structural stability, suggesting an allosteric regulatory mechanism. A potential binding channel for a small therapeutic molecule was identified at the interface of STING and COPA. If the channel in the COPA STING interface meets criteria for depth, stability, and functional significance, it could be a drug-binding pocket. A therapeutic small molecule docked in a binding pocket at the interface of two interacting proteins can disrupt the protein-protein complex. This approach, known as PPI inhibition, is a well-established strategy in drug discovery. Fosfomycin, a phosphate-containing molecule, docked in the channel at the interface of COPA and STING.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study provides novel structural insights into the protective role of HAQ-STING in COPA syndrome. The conformational shift induced by HAQ-STING may modulate immune signaling, preventing disease manifestation. A potential binding channel for a small therapeutic molecule was identified at the interface of STING and COPA; fosfomycin was docked in this channel. These findings highlight potential therapeutic avenues, including gene therapy, small-molecule inhibitors, and STING pathway modulation. Further experimental validation is needed to translate these structural insights into clinical applications.",Lehrer S,"Pharmacology, Fermata Pharma, New York, USA.",Cureus,2025-04-14,10.7759/cureus.82254,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Allosteric; Small Molecule; Sting; Copa; Haq Sting Mutation
40234991,"Safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, and effectiveness of Lassa fever vaccines in pregnant persons, children, and adolescents: a protocol for a living systematic review and meta-analysis.","<h4>Background</h4>Lassa fever (LF), caused by the Lassa virus (LASV), is a zoonotic viral hemorrhagic disease endemic to West Africa, primarily transmitted through rodent excreta and infected bodily fluids. It poses significant public health challenges due to its high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among at-risk populations like pregnant persons and children. Despite decades of research, vaccine development has been hindered by the virus's genetic diversity and complex epidemiology. While several vaccine candidates have been developed, none have received regulatory approval. Given the rapidly evolving vaccine landscape, a living systematic review (LSR) was selected to enable real-time evidence synthesis. This protocol outlines a living systematic review (LSR) to evaluate the safety, efficacy, effectiveness, and immunogenicity of LASV vaccines, providing evidence to guide public health interventions and vaccine recommendations.<h4>Methods</h4>We will conduct a biweekly updated LSR and meta-analysis, systematically searching databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from January 2014 onward to identify studies of LASV vaccines in pregnant persons, children, and adolescents. All study designs, including randomized trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and case reports, will be eligible. Pairs of reviewers will independently assess eligibility, extract data, and evaluate the risk of bias. Primary outcomes include vaccine safety, efficacy, and effectiveness in pregnant persons (including neonatal outcomes), children, and adolescents, while secondary outcomes assess immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Data on adult populations will also be included, and results on this group will be reported as available. We will conduct paired meta-analyses, including prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses. We will use the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach to evaluate the certainty of evidence.<h4>Discussion</h4>This LSR offers a dynamic framework to generate timely evidence on LASV vaccines for vulnerable populations.
