40098308,Visualized hysteroscopic artificial intelligence fertility assessment system for endometrial injury: an image-deep-learning study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Asherman's syndrome (AS) is a significant cause of subfertility in women from developing countries. Over 80% of AS cases in these regions are linked to dilation and curettage (D&C) procedures following pregnancy. The incidence of AS in patients with infertility and recurrent miscarriage can be as high as 10%, while the pregnancy rate in cases of moderate to severe adhesions can be as low as 34%. We aimed to establish a hysteroscopic artificial intelligence system using image-deep-learning algorithms for fertility assessment.<h4>Methods</h4>This diagnostic study included 555 cases with 4922 hysteroscopic images from a Chinese intrauterine adhesions cohort clinical database (NCT05381376). The study evaluated two image-deep-learning algorithms' effectiveness in predicting pregnancy within one year, using AUCs and decision curve analysis. The models' performance was evaluated for two-year prediction <i>via</i> concordance index and cumulative time-dependent ROC. A quantifiable visualization panel of the system was established.<h4>Results</h4>The proportional hazard CNN system accurately predicted conception, with AUCs of 0.982, 0.992, and 0.990 in three randomly assigned datasets, superior to the InceptionV3 framework, and achieved a net benefit of 69.4% for subfertility assessment. The system fitted well with c-indexes of 0.920-0.940 and was time-stable. The quantifiable visualization panel displayed four intrauterine pathologies intuitively. The performance was comparable to senior hysteroscopists, with a kappa value of 0.84-0.89.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The CNN based on the proportional hazard approach accurately assesses fertility postoperatively. The quantifiable visualization panel could assist in intrauterine pathologies assessment, optimize treatment strategies, and achieve individualized and cost-efficient practices.",Li B; Chen H; Duan H,"Department of Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Center, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, Beijing, China.",Annals of medicine,2025-03-17,10.1080/07853890.2025.2478473,7.2,"visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract); artificial intelligence(title,abstract); data(abstract)",Hysteroscopy; Subfertility; Endometrial Injury; Asherman’s Syndrome; Image Deep Learning; Art Triage
40108864,Extended Reality Technologies for Visualization in DIEP Flap Breast Reconstruction: A Systematic Review. ,"BackgroundDeep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction is the gold standard for autologous breast reconstruction but is complex due to variable vascular anatomy. Traditional imaging modalities like computed tomography angiography (CTA) provide two-dimensional visualization, which can limit spatial understanding. Extended reality (XR) technologies, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) offer immersive three-dimensional visualization that may enhance surgical planning and intraoperative guidance. This systematic review synthesizes current evidence regarding XR applications in DIEP flap breast reconstruction.MethodsA systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines.

40113627,Global Bibliometric Visualization of Epidermal Growth Factor in Wound Healing: A Comprehensive Literature Search. ,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is essential for both wound repair and the maintenance of healthy tissues. Numerous bibliometric studies have been published on wound healing; however, none have focused on EGF in wound healing. This study comprehensively analyzed scientific publications on the role of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) in wound healing. The analysis encompassed publications indexed in the Scopus database from 1972 to 2024, retrieved using a broad range of relevant keywords. Network analysis and visualization were subsequently conducted using VOSviewer (v. 1.6.20) to map research trends and identify research hotspots. My examination of the Scopus database identified 3122 articles on the use of EGF in wound healing published over the past 48 years (1972-2024). Most of these publications were research articles (n = 2812; 90.07%), followed by review articles (n = 244; 7.82%). The number of publications on the use of EGF in wound healing has increased significantly (R2=0.9449; p < 0.001) over the years. This study revealed that, during the past ten years, there has been an increasing amount of global research on the relationship between EGF and wound healing. The effectiveness and clinical applications of human EGF and EGFR signaling in cancer-related wound healing were the main topics of our study, which focused on EGF and wound healing overall. To improve patient outcomes and enhance the efficacy of wound healing, particularly in aesthetic and reconstructive surgery, this bibliometric analysis emphasizes the importance of ongoing research and collaboration in this field.Level of Evidence V This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

40098221,Development of Immunostaining Protocols for 3D Visualization of Pericytes in Human Retinal Flatmounts.,"Vascular pericytes are widely present across the human body and crucial in regulating vascular flow, permeability, and homeostasis. In the human retina, pericytes are important for forming and maintaining the blood-retinal barrier, as well as for autoregulation of blood flow. Pericyte loss has been implicated in various pathological conditions. Visualization of pericytes by immunofluorescence (IF) staining provides valuable information on pericyte number, morphology, location, and on expression of anatomic and functional markers. However, species-specific differences in pericyte marker expression exist. In this study, we aimed to develop a novel IF co-staining protocol to detect the pericyte markers NG2, PDGFRβ, αSMA, CD13, and RFC1 in human retinal flatmounts. Unlike retinal sections, retinal flatmounts enable 3D visualization of pericyte distribution across the entire vascular network. Key optimizations included tailoring the fixation method, blocking buffer composition and antibody solvent, as well as using jasplakinolide to enhance αSMA detection. Our protocol successfully enabled double staining of NG2 and PDGFRβ, as well as αSMA and PDGFRβ, whereas CD13 and RFC1 expression was not detectable in human retinal flatmounts. This novel 3D IF protocol enhances in situ visualization of human retinal pericytes, enabling accurate studies of their role in vascular health and disease to aid targeted therapy development.",Bakker N; Croes AA; Prevaes E; van Noorden CJF; Schlingemann RO; Klaassen I,"Ocular Angiogenesis Group, Department of Ophthalmology, Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,2025-03-17,10.1369/00221554251323655,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Retina; Pericyte; 3D Imaging; Immunofluorescence Staining; Flatmount

40116728,Meeting Global Health Needs via Infectious Disease Forecasting: Development of a Reliable Data-Driven Framework. ,"Infectious diseases (IDs) have a significant detrimental impact on global health. Timely and accurate ID forecasting can result in more informed implementation of control measures and prevention policies. To meet the operational decision-making needs of real-world circumstances, we aimed to build a standardized, reliable, and trustworthy ID forecasting pipeline and visualization dashboard that is generalizable across a wide range of modeling techniques, IDs, and global locations. We forecasted 6 diverse, zoonotic diseases (brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Q fever, tick-borne encephalitis, and tularemia) across 4 continents and 8 countries. We included a wide range of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models (n=9) and trained them on a multitude of features (average n=2326) within the One Health landscape, including demography, landscape, climate, and socioeconomic factors. The pipeline and dashboard were created in consideration of crucial operational metrics-prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, spatiotemporal generalizability, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability-which are essential to strategic data-driven decisions. While no single best model was suitable for all disease, region, and country combinations, our ensemble technique selects the best-performing model for each given scenario to achieve the closest prediction. For new or emerging diseases in a region, the ensemble model can predict how the disease may behave in the new region using a pretrained model from a similar region with a history of that disease. The data visualization dashboard provides a clean interface of important analytical metrics, such as ID temporal patterns, forecasts, prediction uncertainties, and model feature importance across all geographic locations and disease combinations. As the need for real-time, operational ID forecasting capabilities increases, this standardized and automated platform for data collection, analysis, and reporting is a major step forward in enabling evidence-based public health decisions and policies for the prevention and mitigation of future ID outbreaks.",Keshavamurthy R; Pazdernik KT; Ham C; Dixon S; Erwin S; Charles LE,"Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, 902 Battelle Boulevard, Richland, WA, 99354, United States.",JMIR public health and surveillance,2025-03-21,10.2196/59971,6.3,"visualization(abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
40116889,"Artificial intelligence for abdominopelvic trauma imaging: trends, gaps, and future directions. ","Abdominopelvic trauma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, typically resulting from high-energy mechanisms such as motor vehicle collisions and penetrating injuries. Admission abdominopelvic trauma CT, performed either selectively or as part of a whole-body CT protocol, has become the workhorse screening and surgical planning modality due to improvements in speed and image quality. Radiography remains an essential element of the secondary trauma survey, and Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scanning has added value for quick assessment of non-compressible hemorrhage in hemodynamically unstable patients. Complex and severe polytrauma cases often delay radiology report turnaround times, which can potentially impede urgent clinical decision-making. Artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) offers promising solutions for enhanced diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in abdominopelvic trauma imaging. Although commercial AI tools for abdominopelvic trauma are currently available for only a few use cases, the literature reveals robust research and development (R&D) of prototype tools. Multiscale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models are capable of detecting and quantifying solid organ injuries, fractures, and hemorrhage with a high degree of precision. Further, generalist foundation models such as multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) can be adapted and fine-tuned using imaging, clinical, and text data for a range of tasks, including detection, quantitative visualization, prognostication, and report auto-generation. Despite their promise, for most use cases in abdominopelvic trauma, AI CAD tools remain in the pilot stages of technology readiness, with persistent challenges related to data availability; the need for open-access PACS compatible software pipelines for pre-clinical shadow-testing; lack of well-designed multi-institutional validation studies; and regulatory hurdles.

40095289,Developing a machine learning-based predictive model for the analgesic effectiveness of transdermal fentanyl in cancer patients: an interpretable approach. ,"Cancer-related pain is a common and distressing symptom in patients with malignant tumors, significantly affecting quality of life. Transdermal fentanyl is a convenient opioid option for patients with intestinal obstruction or difficulty swallowing; however, some patients do not experience adequate pain relief. Predicting transdermal fentanyl analgesic effectiveness is crucial to optimize pain management. This study aimed to develop a predictive model for transdermal fentanyl effectiveness in cancer patients. Clinical data from adult cancer pain patients at Chongqing University Cancer Hospital were analyzed (January 2020-December 2022). Logistic regression and feature selection were applied, followed by developing nine predictive models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the Youden index, and the Brier score were used to evaluate the performance of the model. Cross-validation and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis were used for validation and feature interpretation. Among 151 patients, 27.2% reported ineffectiveness of transdermal fentanyl. Logistic regression identified key factors of NRS, transdermal fentanyl dosage, BMI2, and ALT. Among the nine models, RF Model 8 exhibited the best performance, achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.984 (95% CI: [0.968, 0.999]). This performance was further validated by the confusion matrix metrics and visualization results.

40118459,Visualize neuronal membrane cholesterol with split- fluorescent protein tagged YDQA sensor. ,"Cholesterol is a major component of the cellular plasma membrane (PM), and its homeostasis is essential for brain health. Dysregulated cholesterol homeostasis has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in vivo visualization of cholesterol has remained challenging, hindering a comprehensive understanding of AD pathology. In this study, we generated a new sensor combining the split-fluorescent protein tags with YDQA, a derivate of cholesterol-dependent cytolysin PFO. Through a series of validations in cell and C. elegans models, we demonstrate that the new sensor (name as sfPMcho) efficiently detects neuronal PM cholesterol. We further applied this sensor in 5X FAD and APOE KO mice models and revealed the cholesterol changes within neurons. PM cholesterol became sparse and locally aggregated in neuron bodies but significantly accumulated in nerve fibers. Collectively, this study provides a new tool for detecting neuronal PM cholesterol in vivo and uncovers cholesterol abnormalities in AD-related pathology at the cellular level.

40098415,"An RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a based platform for rapid, sensitive, and visual detection of Apis mellifera filamentous virus.","Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV) is an emerging DNA virus significantly affecting honey bee health. AmFV infections weaken bee resistance to other pathogens, and can cause tissue lysis and death. Early, accurate detection of AmFV is crucial for timely intervention and preventing large-scale outbreaks. Current AmFV detection relies largely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. To enable rapid field detection of AmFV, we developed a rapid and ultrasensitive detection platform using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated nuclease 12a (Cas12a) technology. A CRISPR RNA (crRNA1) specifically targeting the AmFV Bro gene was designed, ensuring no cross-reactivity with other insect DNA viruses or uninfected honey bees. After optimization of the reaction time, the platform generated results within 35 min: 20 min for the RPA reaction and 15 min for CRISPR-mediated cleavage. Two visualization approaches, fluorescence-based and lateral flow dipstick, were used to display the detection results. The detection sensitivity of both approaches was as few as 10 copies of the AmFV genome. Validation with field-collected honey bee samples demonstrated consistency with conventional PCR, revealing widespread latent AmFV infections in the field. Taken together, we successfully developed an RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 platform for rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of AmFV in Apis mellifera and Apis cerana.

They were randomly divided into a control group (treated with simple microscope surgery, n = 94) and an observation group (treated with microscope combined with neuroendoscopy, n = 95). The treatment effects of the two groups were observed, mainly including depression and anxiety scale scores, cognitive function assessment results and quality of life assessment data. Before treatment, the depression and anxiety scale scores, cognitive function assessment results and quality of life assessment data of the two groups of patients at different time points were compared, and there was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). After microscope combined with neuroendoscopy treatment, the study revealed that the observation group surpassed the control group in alleviating depression and anxiety, accelerating cognitive function recovery, and enhancing quality of life, with these differences being statistically significant (P < 0.05). Surgical treatment combined with microscopy and neuroendoscopy has a significant positive effect on the mental health, cognitive function and overall quality of life of patients with intracranial aneurysm rupture and bleeding, can shorten the operation time and treatment time, and provides a new strategic reference for clinical treatment.",Shi LK; Cai XF; He JQ; Wang YH,"Department of Neurosurgery, Wuxi Clinical College of Anhui Medical University, Wuxi 214000, Jiangsu Province, China.",World journal of psychiatry,2025-03-19,10.5498/wjp.v15.i3.100565,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40108657,MicrobeRX: a tool for enzymatic-reaction-based metabolite prediction in the gut microbiome. ,"The gut microbiome functions as a metabolic organ, producing numerous enzymes that influence host health; however, their substrates and metabolites remain largely unknown. We present MicrobeRX, an enzyme-based metabolite prediction tool that employs 5487 human reactions and 4030 unique microbial reactions from 6286 genome-scale models, as well as 3650 drug metabolic reactions from the DrugBank database (v.5.1.12). MicrobeRX includes additional analysis modules for metabolite visualization and enzymatic and taxonomic analyses. When we applied MicrobeRX to 1083 orally administered drugs that have been approved in at least one jurisdiction at some point in time (DrugBank), it predicted metabolites with physicochemical properties and structures similar to metabolites found in biosamples (from MiMeDB). It also outperformed another existing metabolite prediction tool (BioTransformer 3.0) in terms of predictive potential, molecular diversity, reduction of redundant predictions, and enzyme annotation. Our analysis revealed both unique and overlapping metabolic capabilities in human and microbial metabolism and chemo- and taxa-specific microbial biotransformations. MicrobeRX bridges the genomic and chemical spaces of the gut microbiome, making it a valuable tool for unlocking the chemical potential of the gut microbiome in human health, the food and pharmaceutical industries, and environmental safety.

40097985,Collaborative networks in community-based health and social care services: insights from Blackpool and the Fylde Coast (United Kingdom).,"<h4>Background</h4>Globally, health and social care systems have been responding to the demand for better integrated service delivery to tackle complex public health and socioeconomic challenges. Similarly, services in the United Kingdom strive for comprehensive, person-centred care to support health equity and improved quality of life. This study took place in Blackpool and the Fylde Coast, United Kingdom, where socioeconomic deprivation and health inequalities persist and effective collaboration among health and social care providers offers an opportunity to tackle such complex challenges. The study used social network analysis (SNA) to investigate collaboration patterns between organizations to identify key characteristics and areas for improved integration.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were collected from March to June 2023. First, a comprehensive mapping exercise identified a total of 453 community-based providers who were invited to participate via email. Data on service provision were collected using an adapted version of the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) form from organizations' websites. Service descriptions were thematically categorized into 11 domains. A total of 44 organizations provided information on their collaborations through an online survey, reporting on collaborations across 321 organizations. SNA examined collaboration patterns via visualization and multivariate network regressions (MRQAP).<h4>Results</h4>The mapping identified a great range of community-based support. The network density indicated relatively low overall collaboration (2.2%) among 321 organizations. Within the subset of 44 organizations who completed the questionnaire, collaborations were more frequent (15%). Collaboration ties were unevenly distributed, where some organizations had more connections. MRQAP showed that organizations within the same domain were more likely to collaborate. Some combinations, such as collaborations between housing, shelter and nutritional support with child and family support and mental health were significantly overrepresented.<h4>Discussion</h4>The network had low density, highlighting the potential for more collaborations. The network appears fragmented, probably owing to a tendency for organizations to collaborate with others operating in the same service domain. The frequent collaborations between certain domains highlight the complex needs of local communities. Effective integrated care initiatives, data sharing and place-based partnership/voluntary, community, faith, social enterprise sector capacity-building programmes could build more resilient and interconnected networks that meet community needs.",Santa K; Boda Z; Kara B; Huber J; Catt H; Mezes B,"Department of Primary Care and Mental Health, Institute of Population Health, University of Liverpool, 74 Bedford Street South, Liverpool, L69 7ZA, United Kingdom.",Health research policy and systems,2025-03-17,10.1186/s12961-025-01303-1,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Health care; England; Social Care; Collaboration; Integrated Care; Community-based Services; Social Network Analysis; Health Equity

40108724,ADME gene-driven prognostic model for bladder cancer: a breakthrough in predicting survival and personalized treatment. ,"Genes that participate in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) processes occupy a central role in pharmacokinetics. Meanwhile, variability in clinical outcomes and responses to treatment is notable in bladder cancer (BLCA). Our study utilized expansive datasets from TCGA and the GEO to explore prognostic factors in bladder cancer. Utilizing both univariate Cox regression and the lasso regression techniques, we identified ADME genes critical for patient outcomes. Utilizing genes identified in our study, a model for assessing risk was constructed. The evaluation of this model's predictive precision was conducted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and assessments based on ROC curves. Furthermore, we devised a predictive nomogram, offering a straightforward visualization of crucial prognostic indicators. To explore the potential factors mediating the differences in outcomes between high and low risk groups, we performed comprehensive analyses including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-based enrichment analyses, immune infiltration variations, somatic mutation landscapes, and pharmacological sensitivity response assessment etc. Immediately following this, we selected core genes based on the PPI network and explored the prognostic potential of the core genes as well as immune modulation, and pathway activation. And the differential expression was verified by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. Finally we explored the potential of the core genes as pan-cancer biomarkers. Our efforts culminated in the establishment of a validated 17-gene ADME-centered risk prediction model, displaying remarkable predictive accuracy for BLCA prognosis. Through separate cox regression analyses, the importance of the model's risk score in forecasting BLCA outcomes was substantiated. Furthermore, a novel nomogram incorporating clinical variables alongside the risk score was introduced. Comprehensive studies established a strong correlation between the risk score and several key indicators: patterns of immune cell infiltration, reactions to immunotherapy, landscape of somatic mutation and profiles of drug sensitivity. We screened the core prognostic gene CYP2C8, explored its role in tumor bioregulation and validated its upregulated expression in bladder cancer. Furthermore, we found that it can serve as a reliable biomarker for pan-cancer. The risk assessment model formulated in our research stands as a formidable instrument for forecasting BLCA prognosis, while also providing insights into the disease's progression mechanisms and guiding clinical decision-making strategies.",Dai H; Zhang X; Zhao Y; Nie J; Hang Z; Huang X; Ma H; Wang L; Li Z; Wu M; Fan J; Jiang K; Luo W; Qin C,"The Affliated Liyang People's Hospital of Kangda College of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China.",Hereditas,2025-03-19,10.1186/s41065-025-00409-4,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40108068,Automated Detection of Hydrocephalus in Pediatric Head Computed Tomography Using VGG 16 CNN Deep Learning Architecture and Based Automated Segmentation Workflow for Ventricular Volume Estimation. ,"Hydrocephalus, particularly congenital hydrocephalus in infants, remains underexplored in deep learning research. While deep learning has been widely applied to medical image analysis, few studies have specifically addressed the automated classification of hydrocephalus. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on the VGG16 architecture to detect hydrocephalus in infant head CT images. The model integrates an automated method for ventricular volume extraction, applying windowing, histogram equalization, and thresholding techniques to segment the ventricles from surrounding brain structures. Morphological operations refine the segmentation and contours are extracted for visualization and volume measurement. The dataset consists of 105 head CT scans, each with 60 slices covering the ventricular volume, resulting in 6300 slices. Manual segmentation by three trained radiologists served as the reference standard. The automated method showed a high correlation with manual measurements, with R2 values ranging from 0.94 to 0.99. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranged 3.99 to 11.13%, while the root mean square error (RRMSE) from 4.56 to 13.74%. To improve model robustness, the dataset was preprocessed, normalized, and augmented with rotation, shifting, zooming, and flipping. The VGG16-based CNN used pre-trained convolutional layers with additional fully connected layers for classification, predicting hydrocephalus or normal labels. Performance evaluation using a multi-split strategy (15 independent splits) achieved a mean accuracy of 90.4% ± 1.2%.

40098024,Prevalence and outcomes of hypocalcemia on ED arrival in traumatic patients before blood transfusions: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Hypocalcemia represents a critical physiological disturbance in trauma-related hemorrhagic shock patients. Nonetheless, the prevalence and effects of hypocalcemia remain uncertain. This study aims to explore the prevalence of hypocalcemia before blood transfusions and its related mortality in adult patients with major traumatic injuries.<h4>Method</h4>We conducted a systematic search through databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science, from their inception until June 30, 2024. Patients with major traumatic injuries whose serum calcium was measured upon arrival at the emergency department (ED) were included. We excluded those with prior blood transfusions, pre-clinical studies, review articles, and studies without a control group. Meta-analysis using a random-effect model was performed. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochrane Q and I² statistics. The study's risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklist. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test and contour funnel plot visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Of the total, 1,984 abstracts were screened, leading to 15 studies in this review and meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of hypocalcemia upon ED arrival was 56% (95% CI 37%-74%), with high heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> 99.8%) observed. Hypocalcemia patients also had higher mortality rates than normocalcemia patients (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.76-3.40).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Hypocalcemia on ED arrival is common among adult trauma patients, who also exhibit a notably high mortality rate within this demographic. We recommend the monitoring of ionized calcium levels in traumatic adult patients. Furthermore, systematically designed studies examining the optimal thresholds, treatment protocols, and outcomes should be prioritized as the focal point of research.<h4>Trial registration</h4>CRD42024549054 ( http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO ).",Srichuachom W; Krintratun S; Chenthanakij B; Wongtanasarasin W,"Department of Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, 110 Intavarorot Street, Sriphum, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",2025-03-17,10.1186/s13049-025-01361-y,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Mortality; Trauma; Hemorrhagic shock; Hypocalcemia; Systematic review
40108797,Deep-learning based multibeat echocardiographic cardiac phase detection. ,"End-to-end automatic detection of cardiac phase in multibeat echocardiograms is crucial for measuring cardiac parameters in clinical scenarios. However, existing studies face limitations due to the high cost of data annotation and collection, and time-consuming detection processes. This study introduces a novel multibeat echocardiographic cardiac phase detection network, EchoPhaseNet, to perform fast and accurate cardiac phase detection of variable-length multibeat echocardiographic sequences, with low annotation costs and limited data. Five echocardiographic datasets were used in this study, including a small-scale private dataset, Echo-DT (DrumTower), a medium-scale publicly available dataset, PhaseDetection, and three additional publicly available datasets: EchoNet-Dynamic, CAMUS, and EchoNet-Dynamic-MultiBeat. EchoPhaseNet and four other deep learning-based cardiac phase detection methods were trained and internally validated on the Echo-DT and PhaseDetection datasets (with sample ratios for training, validation, and testing set at 60%:20%:20% and 80%:0%:20%, respectively), and then externally validated on the other three datasets. Model performance was evaluated using GradCAM for qualitative visualization and absolute frame difference (aFD) for quantitative accuracy, with statistical significance assessed using Tukey's test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction, considering corrected p-values <$<$ 0.05 as significant. The annotation costs and accuracy of end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) detection using EchoPhaseNet were compared with those of four other comparison methods. EchoPhaseNet achieves effective specific phase detections using only ED/ES labels, reducing annotation costs and making it applicable to a wider range of detection scenarios compared to all the comparison methods. On the Echo-DT dataset, EchoPhaseNet's mean aFD values for ED and ES detection in the A4C view samples were 1.08 and 1.04, respectively, significantly outperforming three comparison methods in ED detection accuracy (p-values <$<$ 0.01) and comparable to the remaining one (p-values >$>$ 0.05). On the PhaseDetection dataset, EchoPhaseNet's mean aFD values for ED and ES detection were 1.67 and 2.19, respectively, comparable to the detection accuracies of all four comparison methods (p-values >$>$ 0.05). In addition, EchoPhaseNet showed strong generalization ability on multiple external validation datasets. After training on the small-scale Echo-DT dataset, EchoPhaseNet significantly outperformed the four comparison methods (p-values <$<$ 0.01) in ED detection, achieving mean aFD values of 1.67 and 1.11 on the EchoNet-Dynamic and EchoNet-Dynamic-MultiBeat datasets, respectively. After training on the PhaseDetection dataset, EchoPhaseNet significantly outperformed the four compared methods (p-values <$<$ 0.01) in ES detection on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving mean aFD value of 2.58. EchoPhaseNet's inference time for a single 32-frame sequence segment is substantially lower than that of the four compared methods, not exceeding 8 ms on an RTX 4080 GPU using the PyTorch deep learning framework. EchoPhaseNet exhibits clear advantages over existing studies in data annotation and collection costs, as well as detection speed, and is applicable to a wider range of detection scenarios. It demonstrates good practicality and promising prospects for clinical multibeat echocardiographic cardiac phase detection.",Cheng H; Shi Z; Qi Z; Wang X; Guo G; Fang A; Jin Z; Shan C; Du Y; Chen R; Qian S; Luo S; Yao J,"School of Biological Sciences and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.",Medical physics,2025-03-19,10.1002/mp.17733,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40097793,Beyond the Brazilian Butt Lift: How to Objectively Measure Outcome.,"<h4>Background</h4>The demand for gluteal augmentation, commonly known as Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), has significantly increased, driven by evolving beauty standards. Despite its popularity, the procedure is associated with serious complications, including pulmonary fat embolism, due to the challenges of ensuring the correct injection plane. The development of ultrasound-guided fat grafting offers a potential solution, enhancing the safety and precision of the procedure.<h4>Objectives</h4>To demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and superior aesthetic outcomes of ultrasound-guided gluteal lipofilling. This will be attempted by using specialized software for processing photos and digital images, such as Photoshop, in order to obtain values through measurements that allow for an objective comparison of images of patients who have undergone gluteal lipofilling with and without ultrasound guidance.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective study was conducted on 200 patients who underwent BBL, divided into two groups: 100 patients with traditional, non-ultrasound-guided fat grafting, and 100 with ultrasound-guided fat grafting. The study used preoperative and postoperative photographs analyzed through two-dimensional software to measure changes in gluteal volume. Measurements focused on the distances between fixed anatomical landmarks on the gluteal and thigh regions. Outcomes from the two groups were compared to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the ultrasound-guided technique.<h4>Results</h4>The ultrasound-guided procedure showed improved distribution of adipose tissue in the gluteal region compared to the non-ultrasound-guided technique, with fewer complications reported. The data analysis shows that, for lateral projection images, the average percentage variation was 2.04% for non-ultrasound-guided procedures and 2.81% for ultrasound-guided lipofilling.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The integration of ultrasound technology in BBL procedures allows for real-time visualization of the cannula tip, reducing the risk of intramuscular injections and improving fat distribution. Although minimal, the difference in efficacy between the two techniques is evident. Furthermore, the ultrasound-guided technique has been associated with a lower complication rate according to numerous studies and is therefore preferable. Comparison of Techniques: The study compares the efficacy of ultrasound-guided and non-ultrasound-guided procedures, analyzing data from 200 patients.<h4>Methods</h4>The results were obtained using software for processing photos and images. Efficacy Outcomes: The ultrasound-guided procedure showed a slight but measurable improvement in percentage variation over the non-ultrasound-guided method.<h4>Clinical recommendations</h4>Based on the findings, the ultrasound-guided method is recommended due to its demonstrated safety benefits and reliable results.<h4>Level of evidence iv</h4>This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

40095237,A New Automated Ultrasound Quantification of Urethral Mobility for Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Feasibility Study.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a prevalent condition that can significantly affect quality of life. Urethral mobility is an important factor in SUI and transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) imaging can provide clear visualization of this movement; however, its quantification has been limited. An automated system to track and quantify urethral movement could provide richer information and reduce inter-observer effects on measurements.<h4>Methods</h4>As proof-of-concept for technique development, we used TPUS cine loops obtained on commercial scanners (GE Healthcare and Philips Healthcare) from consented research volunteers. We developed the tracking software based on fundamental concepts from computer vision, specifically corner detection and optical flow-based tracking algorithms. In doing so we account for inadvertent probe movements by using the symphysis pubis as a reference coordinate system.<h4>Results</h4>The system successfully tracks the motion of the urethra during Valsalva maneuvers. It accurately captures and quantifies complex movements, including directional shifts, rotations, displacement vectors of different structures, and the trajectory of motion. These measurements are corrected for any probe movement. We demonstrated the system's efficiency and reliability in near real-time analysis across various ultrasound platforms and video formats. The intraclass correlation coefficients exceeded 0.89 and 0.5 for intra- and inter-rater reliability, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By providing detailed, objective measurements of urogenital movement, this approach has potential to advance the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of SUI, which in turn, can help tailor more effective treatment strategies.

PCa mortality and morbidity are primarily related to its most advanced form, metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC), for which there is presently no cure. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches to increase mCRPC survival are critically needed. Due to PCa tumor heterogeneity and complex tumor microenvironment, the efficacy of single-target radiopharmaceuticals, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 177Lu-PSMA-617, is currently under reassessment. The design and development of PCa dual-target radiopharmaceuticals have garnered considerable attention, due to their benefits over single-target counterparts, namely increased therapeutic specificity and efficacy, as well as the ability to overcome the challenge of inconsistent tumor visualization caused by variable receptor expression across diverse lesions, thereby enabling more comprehensive imaging. Several PCa biomarkers are currently being investigated as potential targets for dual-target radiopharmaceuticals, including prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), integrin αvβ3 receptor, albumin, bisphosphonates, fibroblast activation protein (FAP), sigma-1 receptor, as well as, radiosensitive organelles like mitochondria and the nucleus.

40103282,"Comprehensive Review of Biportal Endoscopic Spine Surgery: History, Techniques, and Implications in Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery. ","Narrative review. To provide an overview of the evolution of biportal endoscopic spine surgery (BE) and its role in addressing specific challenges in minimally invasive spinal procedures, focusing on its technical features and clinical applications. Minimally invasive spine surgery has gained momentum due to its ability to reduce tissue damage, postoperative pain, and recovery times compared to traditional open surgery. BE has emerged as an innovative technique, offering unique visualization and maneuverability that allow for addressing complex spinal pathologies with comparable outcomes to other minimally invasive techniques. This review explores the development of BE, its advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional and full endoscopic spine surgery, and its application in various spinal conditions, based on current literature. BE facilitates enhanced visualization and maneuverability through the use of two independent portals, which allow for precise decompression, discectomy, and fusion procedures with minimal muscle disruption. Studies suggest that BE is well-suited for specific cases requiring delicate tissue handling and complex anatomical access. Studies report reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery compared to traditional methods. While challenges such as longer operation times and learning curves exist, BE offers a valuable alternative to other minimally invasive techniques in procedures like lumbar laminectomy, foraminotomy, and interbody fusion. Biportal endoscopic spine surgery represents an important addition to the arsenal of minimally invasive spine techniques. Its flexibility and adaptability make it a promising option for specific spinal pathologies, particularly in cases where other techniques may pose limitations. Future research should focus on refining surgical protocols, enhancing training frameworks, and expanding the application of BE to other spinal regions and complex conditions.",Yu A; Li SQ; Ndjonko L; Frost J; Berman D; Park HJ; Cho SK,"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, New York, NY.",Spine,2025-03-19,10.1097/brs.0000000000005335,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40108811,Three-Dimensional Imaging of Native Microbiota in Intact Colon. ,"Mapping the spatial locations of gut bacteria in their native environment enhances our understanding of bacteria-host interactions and the physiological and pathological roles these microbes play. However, the intricate composition of bacterial communities in millimeter-scale intestinal tissues presents a great challenge for in situ imaging of their spatial distributions. To address this, we introduce a three-dimensional (3D) imaging strategy that combines a fluorescent tetrapeptide (TetraAA-AcLys) metabolic labeling probe with a tissue clearing protocol. This method enables high-resolution visualization of the microbiota within intact colon, allowing for clear observation of the 3D distribution of gut bacteria across various sections, without interference from host tissues. Moreover, 3D quantitative analysis of the labeled bacteria in a enteritis model reveals their penetration into the mucus layer in colon, highlighting the technique's potential for studying gut microbiota biogeography in health and disease.

It typically arises in the deep soft tissues of the extremities and is rarely found within nerves. However, when occurring in neural tissues, it poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its potential to be mistaken for other types of nerve tumors. In recent years, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have played crucial roles in the early diagnosis of soft tissue tumors. Ultrasound provides real-time visualization of tumor size, morphology, margins, and vascularization characteristics, while MRI offers detailed information on tumor distribution, tissue characteristics, and extent of invasion.

40096737,Initial experience with surgical humidification to prevent tissue dehydration during pterional craniotomy for aneurysm clipping: illustrative case.,"<h4>Background</h4>During craniotomy, brain tissues are exposed to the relatively cold and dry environment of the operating room. This, together with excess localized heat generated from the surgical microscope light, can lead to increased evaporation from the wound, tissue desiccation, and potential thermal injury to neural and vascular tissue. The authors describe their initial experience with the technique of surgical humidification during aneurysm clipping with minimal intracranial irrigation.<h4>Observations</h4>The patient's intracranial tissue showed no visible signs of dehydration, even though no irrigation was used during the intradural dissection stages or aneurysm clipping. The surgical humidification device was easy to use and ergonomic, and it did not interfere with the surgeon's visualization, dissection, or clip application. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient did not experience any perioperative complications.<h4>Lessons</h4>While further investigation is needed to confirm the clinical impact of surgical humidification in neurosurgery, this therapy was safe and effective in this patient.

40095111,Investigating the mechanisms of ethanol-induced disruption of COVID-19 lipid bilayers through molecular dynamics simulations.,"<h4>Context</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, public health officials strongly recommended preventive measures such as disinfectants, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and face masks. The effect of ethanol on virus structure and inactivation remains unclear, and its molecular mechanism needs to be elucidated. This study elucidates how ethanol solutions interact with the lipid bilayer of the COVID-19 virus utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Its findings indicated that ethanol can deactivate the virus through two primary mechanisms. First, when ethanol penetrates the viral membrane, it disrupts the structural integrity of the lipid bilayer, leading to membrane disruption. This alteration in morphology is critical as it compromises the virus's ability to maintain its structure and function.<h4>Methods</h4>For the simulation, a lipid bilayer containing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. The interaction between the viral membrane and ethanol solution was then simulated using GROMACS 5.1.4 for molecular dynamics (MD) analysis. Also, visual molecular dynamics (VMD1.9.3) was used for visualization. The study calculated the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and electrostatic interactions between ethanol and the lipid bilayer, and it analyzed the conformational changes in the spike protein following ethanol adsorption. Additionally, the effects of ethanol penetration on the morphology of the lipid bilayer were evaluated.",Kordzadeh A; Sa AR,"Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.",Journal of molecular modeling,2025-03-17,10.1007/s00894-025-06332-9,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Ethanol; Spike protein; Molecular dynamics; Sars-cov-2
40111779,MRI Co-registered Rodent Histotripsy Array for Orthotopic Liver Models. ,"Histotripsy has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for liver tumors, recently gaining FDA approval for clinical use in October 2023. Preclinical in-vivo histotripsy experiments primarily utilize subcutaneous ectopic murine tumor models, which fail to accurately replicate the complex immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of liver tumors. In order to address this gap, we present the design, development, and in-vivo demonstration of a miniature, electronically steerable MRI-guided histotripsy array tailored for orthotopic murine liver tumor models. This novel system integrates an 89-element phased array within a 7.0T small animal MRI scanner, enabling precise targeting through enhanced soft tissue contrast and three-dimensional visualization. The targeting accuracy of the array was validated in tissue-mimicking red blood cell phantoms, exhibiting targeting precision of 0.24 mm ± 0.1 mm. Subsequent in-vivo experiments in naïve mice demonstrated successful liver ablations, confirmed by gross morphology and histological analysis. However, the presence of grating lobes led to undesired collateral damage, highlighted by lung hemorrhages, necessitating future adjustments in the array's design.

However, the application of current techniques, which are based on volume methods, is still limited to a few specialized centers. Lack of knowledge, coupled with the need for advanced computational resources, can serve as obstacles to implementation. Objective: This study aimed to develop a replicable surgical planning procedure for a simplified and clinically feasible total cavopulmonary geometry. The finite volume method was used to simulate different configurations of cavopulmonary anastomosis under continuous and pulsatile flow and thus gain a better understanding of blood behavior, energy efficiency, and shear stress in the studied regions. Two geometries were found to be efficient in distributing blood flow in a physiological manner, with adequate shear stress and energy loss. In addition to the correct placement of the anastomosis, the results underscored the need for attention regarding potential stenoses in pulmonary arteries to obtain adequate geometries. The developed method proved to be effective for early visualization of post-surgical results, particularly in complex clinical cases.

40103499,Enhanced cGAS-STING Activation and Immune Response by LPDAM Platform-Based Lapachone-Chemical-Photothermal Synergistic Therapy for Colorectal Cancer. ,"The cGAS-STING signaling pathway is a pivotal immune response mechanism that bridges tumor and immune cell interactions. This study describes a multifunctional LPDAM nanoplatform integrating Lapachone, polydopamine (PDA), and Mn2+, which synergistically kills tumor cells and activates the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby inducing DC maturation and T cell activation to achieve potent antitumor immunity. In the tumor microenvironment, Lapachone generates H2O2 via the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1 enzyme), while Mn2+ catalyze H2O2 conversion into •OH through chemodynamic effects (CDT). The photothermal effects (PTT) of PDA further amplify this cascade reaction, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage tumor mitochondria and release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The released mtDNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway, while Mn2+ enhances the sensitivity of cGAS to mtDNA, leading to robust antitumor immunity. Concurrently, photothermal-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) promotes dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, further strengthening immune responses. Moreover, Mn2⁺ also serves as a contrast agent for T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offering precise tumor visualization. This study demonstrates that the LPDAM nanoplatform facilitates Lapachone/CDT/PTT synergistic therapy under MRI guidance, showcasing its potential as an innovative strategy for combined immunotherapy in clinical oncology.",Pan X; Lin Y; Lin C; Liu S; Lin P; Lin X; He R; Ye Z; Ye J; Zhu G,"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery 2 Section, Institute of Abdominal Surgery, Key Laboratory of Accurate Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer, The First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350005, China.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025-03-19,10.1002/adhm.202403309,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40111351,Personal Protection Equipment Training as a Virtual Reality Game in Immersive Environments: Development Study and Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial. ,"Proper donning and doffing of personal protection equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene in the correct spatial context of a health facility is important for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections. On-site training is difficult due to the potential infectious risks and shortages of PPE, whereas video-based training lacks immersion which is vital for the familiarization of the environment. Virtual reality (VR) training can support the repeated practice of PPE donning and doffing in an immersive environment that simulates a realistic configuration of a health facility. This study aims to develop and evaluate a VR simulation focusing on the correct event order of PPE donning and doffing, that is, the item and hand hygiene order in the donning and doffing process but not the detailed steps of how to don and doff an item, in an immersive environment that replicates the spatial zoning of a hospital. The VR method should be generic and support customizable sequencing of PPE donning and doffing. An immersive VR PPE training tool was developed by computer scientists and medical experts. The effectiveness of the immersive VR method versus video-based learning was tested in a pilot study as a randomized controlled trial (N=32: VR group, n=16; video-based training, n=16) using questionnaires on spatial-aware event order memorization questions, usability, and task workload. Trajectories of participants in the immersive environment were also recorded for behavior analysis and potential improvements of the real environment of the health facility. Comparable sequence memorization scores (VR mean 79.38, SD 12.90 vs video mean 74.38, SD 17.88; P=.37) as well as National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores (VR mean 42.9, SD 13.01 vs video mean 51.50, SD 20.44; P=.16) were observed. The VR group had an above-average usability in the System Usability Scale (mean 74.78>70.0) and was significantly better than the video group (VR mean 74.78, SD 13.58 vs video mean 57.73, SD 21.13; P=.009). The analysis and visualization of trajectories revealed a positive correlation between the length of trajectories and the completion time, but neither correlated to the accuracy of the memorization task. Further user feedback indicated a preference for the VR method over the video-based method. Limitations of and suggestions for improvements in the study were also identified. A new immersive VR PPE training method was developed and evaluated against the video-based training. Results of the pilot study indicate that the VR method provides training quality comparable to video-based training and is more usable. In addition, the immersive experience of realistic settings and the flexibility of training configurations make the VR method a promising alternative to video instructions.",Zhou L; Liu H; Fan M; Liu J; Yu X; Zhao X; Zhang S,"Institute of Medical Technology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.",JMIR serious games,2025-03-20,10.2196/69021,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

","Laparoscopic surgery of obese patients still represents a real challenge in clinical practice. High-pressure pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg position are the main anesthesiologic indications to laparotomic conversion. The aim of this prospective study was to assess effectiveness and safety of low-pressure laparoscopic (LPL) procedures using a subcutaneous abdominal wall-retraction (LaparoTenser ®).

40118119,Cumulative plaque burden analysis for phenotyping epicardial coronary artery disease. ,"Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) reveals the location and burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) but is traditionally limited to segment-level analysis. We introduced the cumulative plaque burden index (CPBi), derived from AI-powered quantitative IVUS analysis, to characterize CAD morphological patterns across the entire vessel. In this ASET JAPAN sub-study, pre- and post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) IVUS and angiography were analyzed. Plaque burden was quantified per millimeter on the pre-PCI IVUS. After filtering out plaque burden <40 %, CPB curves were generated to visualize morphological patterns. CPBi, a continuous metric derived from the CPB curves, was calculated to represent morphological patterns, with lower values indicating diffuse disease. Physiological CAD patterns were characterized by Murray law-based quantitative flow ratio (μFR)-derived pullback pressure gradient (PPG). Percentage reclassification was analyzed by comparing CPBi-derived CAD patterns with those derived from visual assessment and μFR-derived PPG. CPB analysis was feasible in 130 out of 138 vessels, quantifying 8101 mm of plaque burden. The Median CPB index (CPBi) was 0.45[0.32-0.58], significantly correlating with μFR-derived PPG (r = 0.35, p < 0.001). Diffuse morphological pattern (low CPBi tertile) was associated with higher percent atheroma volume, longer segments with ≥40 % plaque burden, and longer stents. CPBi reclassified 55.4 % of visually assessed and 46.2 % of μFR-derived CAD patterns. AI enables quantitative plaque burden analysis of the entire IVUS pullback, allowing visualization of morphological patterns via CPB curves and quantification with CPBi, which is associated with atherosclerosis severity and hemodynamics.

Optimizing TE is crucial for tissue contrast and artifact minimization.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the impact of TE on tissue contrast and image quality in T2*-weighted sequences at 7 T in adolescents and young adults.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Ten adolescent and young adult patients underwent 7-T MRI with multi-echo T2*-weighted sequences. Six TEs (8.1 ms to 36 ms) were acquired. Signal contrast ratios (CR) for seven brain regions-caudate nuclei, corpus callosum genu, frontal cortex, cortical veins, globi pallidi, medullary veins, and left optic radiation-were analyzed. Two blinded neuroradiologists assessed image quality and artifact severity using a 4-point Likert scale (IQS). Statistical trends were analyzed using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>The study cohort consisted of 4 male and 6 females; the median age of the patients was 16 years (range 15-23 years). CR increased significantly with higher TEs for most regions except the caudate, where CR decreased (P < 0.05). Longer TEs led to greater artifact severity in the brainstem, temporal, occipital, and frontal lobes (P < 0.02), but not in parietal lobes (P > 0.05). Kappa agreement for IQS was 0.76.<h4>Conclusion</h4>TE significantly affects contrast and artifacts in 7-T T2*-weighted imaging.

40103546,Three-dimensional regional evaluation of right ventricular myocardial work from cine computed tomography: A pilot study. ,"Evaluating regional variations in right ventricular (RV) performance can be challenging, particularly in patients with significant impairments due to the need for 3D spatial coverage with high spatial resolution. ECG-gated cineCT can fully visualize the RV and be used to quantify regional strain with high spatial resolution. However, strain is influenced by loading conditions. Myocardial work (MW)-measured clinically as the ventricular pressure-strain loop area-is considered a more comprehensive metric due to its independence of preload and afterload. In this study, we sought to develop regional RV MW assessments in 3D with high spatial resolution by combining cineCT-derived regional strain with RV pressure waveforms from right heart catheterization (RHC). Regional MW is not measured in the right ventricle (RV) due to a lack of high spatial resolution regional strain (RS) estimates throughout the ventricle. We present a cineCT-based approach to evaluate regional RV performance and demonstrate its ability to phenotype three complex populations: end-stage LV failure (HF), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), and repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF). Forty-nine patients (19 HF, 11 CTEPH, 19 rTOF) underwent cineCT and RHC. RS was estimated as the regional change in the endocardial surface from full-cycle ECG-gated cineCT and combined with RHC pressure waveforms to create regional pressure-strain loops; endocardial MW was measured as the loop area. Detailed, 3D mapping of RS and MW enabled spatial visualization of strain and work strength, and phenotyping of patients. HF patients demonstrated more overall impaired strain and work compared to the CTEPH and rTOF cohorts. For example, the HF patients had more akinetic areas (median: 9%) than CTEPH (median: < 1%, p = 0.02) and rTOF (median: 1%, p < 0.01) and performed more low work (median: 69%) than the rTOF cohort (median: 38%, p < 0.01). The CTEPH cohort had more impairment in the septal wall; < 1% of the free wall and 16% of the septal wall performed negative work. The rTOF cohort demonstrated a wide distribution of strain and work, ranging from hypokinetic to hyperkinetic strain and low to medium-high work. Impaired strain (-0.15 ≤ RS) and negative work were strongly-to-very strongly correlated with RVEF (R = -0.89, p < 0.01; R = -0.70, p < 0.01, respectively), while impaired work (MW ≤ 5 mmHg) was moderately correlated with RVEF (R = -0.53, p < 0.01).
