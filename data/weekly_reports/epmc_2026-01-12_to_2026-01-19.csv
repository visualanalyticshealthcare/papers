41538509,Designing a Substance Misuse Data Dashboard for Overdose Fatality Review Teams: User-Centered Design Approach.,"<h4>Background</h4>Overdose fatality review (OFR) is a public health process in which cases of fatal overdose are carefully reviewed to identify prevention strategies. Current OFR requires review of multiple unconnected data sources, which is a manually intensive process. The Substance Misuse Data Commons (SMDC) was created to link electronic health record data with data from local and state agencies into a single, cloud-based e-platform but does not currently have a data visualization tool.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to use human factors design principles to develop a comprehensive dashboard for the SMDC that could facilitate enhanced processes to support OFR.<h4>Methods</h4>We first surveyed OFR leaders in Wisconsin using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index to understand the cognitive workload of 3 tasks: (1) analysis of population-level overdose trends, (2) selection and preparation of individual cases for review, and (3) abstraction of data from individual causes. We then conducted semistructured interviews to identify targets for workflow optimization. Next, we developed a prototype dashboard for evaluation using a synthetic dataset built with GPT-4. We subsequently performed iterative design sessions with heuristic evaluations and collected end-user feedback on the final prototype via a second round of semistructured interviews and targeted surveys, including the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and the Perceived Usefulness Questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index revealed a moderately high mental workload with the current workflow for all 3 tasks, with mean scores of 12.60 (SD 3.31), 11.90 (SD 3.57), and 12.43 (SD 5.41) for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Interviews pointed to causes including technological challenges and a reliance on manual processes. The prototype dashboard addressed these concerns by integrating multiple data sources to generate population-level visualizations and patient-level event timelines. End users reported the potential for improved efficiency and data accessibility compared to antecedent processes. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology results indicated the dashboard would likely be adopted if made available, with a mean of 4.07 out of 5.00 (SD 0.65). The Perceived Usefulness Questionnaire results suggested moderate usefulness for both the aggregate and individual-level data, with means of 3.61 (SD 0.82) and 3.64 (SD 0.85) out of 5.00, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>OFR is a data-intensive process that traditionally demands substantial cognitive and manual effort, and there are multiple barriers to efficiently collecting data and presenting them for review. The dashboard offers a user-centered, informatics-based approach to streamline data aggregation and presentation, potentially enhancing the efficiency of case reviews. Implementing a dashboard that consolidates and visualizes disparate data sources has the potential to alleviate the manual workload in OFR. Ultimately, our aim is to deliver a finalized data dashboard with real-world SMDC data, giving OFR leaders additional tools to aid in their rigorous work shaping interventions to reduce overdose fatalities.",Pisani M; Oguss MK; Dickson-Gomez J; Kostelac C; Parry A; Moss S; Salisbury-Afshar E; Patterson B; Spigner M; Gussick M; Krautkramer A; Gruenloh T; Safipour Afshar A; Gupta P; Mayampurath A; Afshar M,"Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States.",JMIR human factors,2026-01-15,10.2196/79407,13.2,"visualization(abstract); dashboard(title,abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,title,abstract); informatics(kw,abstract); electronic health record(abstract)",Data Linkage; Qualitative Research; Substance Use Disorders; Public Health Informatics; Overdose
41526607,FRACTURE MRI: evaluation of imaging capability in hand tendon visualization using healthy volunteer MRI.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the conspicuity of fast field echo resembling a CT using restricted echo-spacing (FRACTURE) in visualizing hand tendons and assess the utility of FRACTURE-derived volume rendering (VR) images using MRI in healthy individuals.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This prospective observational study enrolled ten healthy volunteers who underwent MRI, including FRACTURE, three-dimensional proton density-weighted volume isotropic turbo spin-echo acquisition (PD-VISTA), and two-dimensional T2-weighted image (T2WI) in neutral and ulnar deviation positions. VR images depicting bones and tendons were created from FRACTURE data. Twenty-four flexor and extensor tendons were qualitatively evaluated by four experienced readers using a 5-point scale for cross-sectional images (including FRACTURE inversion) and a 3-point scale for VR images. Quantitative analysis included tendon cross-sectional area measurements and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) calculations. Inter- and intra-reader reliability and FRACTURE-inversion agreement were assessed using weighted kappa coefficients. Statistical analysis included an ordinal mixed-effects model, Bland-Altman analysis, correlation coefficients, and paired t-tests.<h4>Results</h4>Ten healthy volunteers (5 men, 5 women, mean age 37.4 ± 9.1 years) were evaluated. FRACTURE achieved the highest qualitative scores (3.30 ± 0.364) compared to PD-VISTA (3.09 ± 0.265) and T2WI (2.60 ± 0.509), showing statistically significant superiority by ordinal mixed-effects modeling (p < 0.001). FRACTURE inversion showed high agreement with FRACTURE (weighted kappa = 0.975). Tendon cross-sectional area measurements showed strong correlations between sequences (r = 0.680-0.740) but significant systematic bias (p < 0.017), with FRACTURE measuring consistently smaller areas. FRACTURE demonstrated significantly higher CNR for muscle-tendon comparisons (12.63 ± 1.088 vs 7.911 ± 1.746, p < 0.017).<h4>Conclusion</h4>FRACTURE provides superior hand tendon visualization compared to conventional MRI sequences, with potential value for clinical practice.<h4>Critical relevance statement</h4>FRACTURE showed superior hand tendon visualization compared to T2WI and PD-VISTA, potentially helping assess anatomical variations. VR images provide a three-dimensional understanding of the hand tendon structure. These capabilities could enhance surgical planning and procedure selection in hand surgery.<h4>Key points</h4>FRACTURE performs better than T2WI and PD-VISTA for evaluating hand tendons. FRACTURE provides excellent contrast, enabling the creation of VR images. FRACTURE could serve as an aid in surgical planning and procedure selection, with the potential to improve hand surgery practice.",Matsuzawa Y; Matsuura Y; Kitsukawa K; Fujimoto H; Mukai H; Hashiba J; Yoda T; Kurosawa R; Sada T; Ozawa Y; Shiko Y; Takahashi K; Yamazaki T; Inaguma K; Suzuki T; Ohtori S,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan. yukari0130i@gmail.com.",Insights into imaging,2026-01-12,10.1186/s13244-025-02182-4,12.0,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Fracture; Visualization; Hand And Finger Tendons; Vr Image
41530727,CalCORVID: a dynamic RShiny dashboard approach to visualize spatiotemporal clusters for public health surveillance.,"<h4>Background</h4>Infectious disease surveillance is an essential component of public health for preventing and mitigating outbreaks. Systematically applying statistical methods for anomaly detection to surveillance data can expedite outbreak response through early warning. A commonly used approach is the usage of spatiotemporal scan statistics as implemented in SaTScan, a software that analyzes spatiotemporal data to identify clusters of events over space and time that deviate from expected values. Some health departments identify outbreaks and prioritize resources using SaTScan for early cluster detection for diseases such as salmonellosis, legionellosis, and COVID-19. However, as a standalone software, SaTScan v10.2.1 does not provide functionality to easily disseminate visual cluster results over time in a way that is tailored to epidemiologists' needs for real-time disease surveillance.<h4>Results</h4>We developed an open source dashboard that provides a customizable framework for displaying results and facilitating the use of SaTScan for public health surveillance. The California Clustering for Operational Real-time Visualization of Infectious Diseases (CalCORVID) dashboard is built using RShiny, is specifically designed for SaTScan outputs, and can be easily adapted to display any jurisdiction's results. This dashboard features a map and corresponding results table, the option to view historical results, integration of the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to contextualize clusters, and interactive elements to enhance usability for epidemiologists.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We present CalCORVID as a complementary tool to native outputs of SaTScan v10.2.1, allowing users to visualize, customize, and distribute their results for specific public health use cases. Epidemiologists currently using SaTScan can adapt the provided code repository and dashboard template to display their own jurisdictions' results, facilitating dissemination of cluster results for real-time, ongoing disease surveillance.",Lu P; Jain S; León TM; White LA,"Division of Communicable Disease Control, California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA.

41524897,ViMDT: a clinical data visual analysis tool for multi-disciplinary treatment of lung cancer.,"Multi-disciplinary treatment (MDT) has become a routine practice in clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment, playing an indispensable role in clinical decision-making. By integrating expertise from multiple disciplines, MDT provides patients with individualized diagnosis and treatment strategies. However, there is not yet a specialized clinical data visualization tool for MDT. This paper develops a novel clinical data analysis visualization tool for MDT, which analyzes in-depth and displays patient data comprehensively. Specifically, this tool designs a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based visualization model for clinical unstructured data, and Z-Score-3σ transformation and hierarchical strategies for clinical structural data. Moreover, we propose to predict personalized anti-tumor drug efficacy based on topic keywords. The results showed that, compared with users who did not use the tool, the time cost in MDT decision-making for users who used the tool was reduced by 26.17%. Furthermore, the proposed drug efficacy prediction method achieved an accuracy rate of 71.08% on a dataset of 958 patients with non-small cell cancer treated with anti-tumor drugs. The proposed tool is potentially helpful for doctors in MDT tasks by vividly visualizing the large-scale complex clinical data and improving the MDT efficiency.",Zhu W; Jiang X; Zhang L; Zhou P; Xie X; Wang H,"University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China.",Clinical and experimental medicine,2026-01-12,10.1007/s10238-025-01898-3,11.4,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Lda; Electronic Medical Records; Mdt; Clinical Data Visualization And Analysis
41529840,A Unified System-Wide Electronic Dashboard for Inpatient Glucose Management Across a Large Health System.,"<h4>Background</h4>Despite established guidelines and increasing national hospital quality metrics, achieving consistent inpatient glycemic control remains challenging. A system-wide glucose data monitoring dashboard can help consolidate and visualize key metrics to support quality improvement (QI) and standardize care.<h4>Methods</h4>A web-based diabetes dashboard was implemented across 7 hospitals within a large health care system to monitor monthly data from the electronic health record. Metrics included patient-days with hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), hyperglycemia (mean >180 mg/dL), in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmissions to the emergency department (ED) or inpatient/observation (IP/OBS). A total of 455 303 admissions were analyzed between January 2018 and March 2025, comparing pre-implementation (2018-2022) to post-implementation (2023-2025). Statistical analyses included <i>t</i> tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Given differences between the large academic site and 6 community hospitals, a difference-in-differences analysis was performed to evaluate impact by hospital type.<h4>Results</h4>After implementation of the dashboard, patient-days with hypoglycemia decreased from 4.81% to 4.15%, hyperglycemia from 25.30% to 23.46%, mortality from 2.69% to 2.13%, and LOS from 7.56 to 7.29 days (all <i>P</i> < .01). Emergency department and IP/OBS readmissions increased slightly (<i>P</i> < .01 and <i>P</i> = .01, respectively). Comparing the community hospitals to the academic, statistically significant reductions were observed in hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and mortality but with increased ED readmissions. There were no differences in LOS or IP/OBS readmission.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Implementation of a system-wide electronic dashboard was associated with improved glycemic control, mortality, and LOS. Dashboards can effectively support multidisciplinary collaboration and QI in diverse hospital settings.",Sadhu AR; Patham B; Dowlatshahi S; Kansara A; Yarlagadda SL; Lin YY; Sucgang R; Dhanasekaran M; Askary B,"Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Houston Methodist, Houston, TX, USA.",Journal of diabetes science and technology,2026-01-13,10.1177/19322968251411335,9.9,"dashboard(kw,title,abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract); electronic health record(abstract)",Quality improvement; Inpatient; Hospitals; Glycemic control; Health System; Dashboard
41540494,Visualizing contextual determinants in and across heterogeneous settings: a qualitative study on structured school health promotion implementation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Schools have the potential to promote equitable health from early life onwards yet require sufficient organizational capacity to achieve sustained action. Structured improvement approaches, such as PDSA cycles, may help strengthen this capacity by guiding systematic implementation processes. However, their potential in school health promotion remains insufficiently understood, particularly regarding the heterogeneous contextual factors shaping their application. This study examined which contextual determinants shape schools' perceived implementability of the PDSA cycle for health promotion and how these conditions differ across schools.<h4>Methods</h4>Nine German primary schools participating in a holistic health promotion program were purposively sampled to capture heterogeneity across federal states, socioeconomic contexts, and urban-rural settings. Semi-structured qualitative group interviews in a workshop format were conducted with school principals, teachers, and parents and analyzed using the framework method guided by the CFIR. To facilitate cross-case comparison, color-coded valence ratings (facilitator/barrier/mixed) were visualized in a Matrix Heat Map, enabling identification of contextual tendencies.<h4>Results</h4>Fifteen contextual factors emerged across the CFIR domains of Outer Setting, Inner Setting, and Individual. Schools with prior experience using structured processes similar to PDSA cycles reported more facilitators, such as established communication structures, while schools without such experience perceived more barriers, notably financial constraints. Common barriers across schools included limited parental engagement and staff shortages, whereas leadership support and compatibility of program components were consistent facilitators. Some factors interacted dynamically, with resource constraints reinforcing other barriers or with strong mission alignment amplifying engagement.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Schools' prior structured experience seemed to be associated with how they perceived the implementability of PDSA cycles for health promotion implementation, with more experienced schools anticipating more facilitators and fewer barriers. While causality cannot be inferred, these exploratory findings are hypothesis-generating and suggest that prior structured experience may be an important factor to consider for tailoring implementation support and building organizational capacity. Beyond these insights, extending the framework method with a color-coded Matrix Heat Map proved valuable for visualizing contextual heterogeneity and revealing tendencies across cases. This combined approach may inspire further research on how contextual configurations shape the use of structured processes in complex, multi-site implementation settings.",Sterr K; Cragun D; Mess F; Butscher F; Singer M; Blaschke S,"TUM School of Medicine and Health, Department of Health and Sport Sciences, Technical University of Munich, Am Olympiacampus 11, 80809, Munich, Germany. katharina.sterr@tum.de.",Implementation science communications,2026-01-16,10.1186/s43058-026-00861-x,8.6,"visualization(kw); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(kw)",Context; Data Visualization; School Health Promotion; Capacity-building; Pdsa Cycle; Cross-case Comparison; Matrix Heat Map; Multi-site Implementation
41539127,Communicable diseases platform (CDP): Real-Time clinical analytics for infections.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Communicable diseases, especially seasonal respiratory illnesses, contribute significantly to paediatric hospital presentations and admissions. Existing surveillance systems often require retrospective manual data collation and focus on either demographic or clinical data, not both. The Communicable Diseases Platform (CDP) is a dynamic data platform that aggregates both data types for all communicable disease presentations to The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne (RCH).<h4>Methods</h4>In the pilot phase, the CDP extracted de-identified aggregated data from hospital electronic medical records for patients with positive respiratory swabs. A dashboard displayed positivity rate and cumulative hospital admissions trends from 2016 to 2025, further filterable by pathogen, age, presentation type and interventions.<h4>Discussion</h4>The CDP improves understanding of clinical profiles, disease burden and seasonal patterns, supporting better outbreak control, patient flow prediction and clinical surveillance.

41546374,CancerSEA-X: A Single-cell Resource for Tumor Microenvironment Cell States Across over 30 Cancer Types.,"Single-cell studies have significantly advanced our understanding of the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity in cancers. Recent studies have identified distinct states of cancer, immune, and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), with growing evidence highlighting their clinical significance and therapeutic potential. Here, we present CancerSEA-X, an expanded version of CancerSEA that offers a comprehensive atlas of TME cell states. CancerSEA-X integrates 25 cancer cell states, 105 immune cell states, and 26 stromal cell states from systematically curated publications. Combining 239 single-cell datasets across 32 cancer types, encompassing over 9 million cells from 2120 patients, CancerSEA-X provides functional activity spectra and cancer-specific gene associations for these 156 cell states. These cell state-gene relationships were mapped onto networks, providing a systematic view of the TME. To improve usability, we redesigned the user interface to feature cell state characterization, state-gene correlation analysis, and interactive visualization of cell state-gene networks, enabling researchers to comprehensively explore these states and their functional relevance. Overall, CancerSEA-X serves as a valuable platform for investigating TME cell states, deepening our understanding of cancer heterogeneity, and potentially advancing the design of more effective clinical therapies.

41543252,Rebuilding the pelvis: advances in robotic-assisted management of complex pelvic fractures.,"Complex pelvic fractures are infamously challenging to fix surgically because of their fine anatomy and proximity to vital neurovascular structures. Traditional open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) improves stability but is complicated by excessive blood loss, longer operative time, and morbidity. Robotic-assisted surgical methods, i.e. Robot-Assisted Fracture Reduction (RAFR) and the TiRobot platform, provide a paradigm shift toward precise, minimally invasive fracture reduction and fixation. The RAFR system blends preoperative high-definition 3D CT imaging with intraoperative cone-beam CT and real-time navigation for dynamic visualization and accurate fragment control to eliminate guesswork and minimize the risk of malposition. Its cutting-edge robotic arm, electrically actuated holding devices, and elastic counterforces of traction ensure controlled and safe fracture reduction with soft tissue and neurovascular integrity preservation. Robot-assisted support is assisted by extensive clinical evidence to enhance the accuracy of surgery with sub-millimeter positioning discrepancies, reduce intraoperative blood loss, reduce exposure to radiation, reduce operative and hospital stay times, and enhance functional restoration according to scores demonstrated. Robot over conventional techniques reduces postoperative infection, implant loosening, nonunion, and nerve or vessel injury. TiRobot enhances fixation using artificial intelligence-assisted screw path planning and navigation. Albeit promising, it has limitations in adoption, such as being costly, having no feedback, and a high learning curve. More multicenter randomized clinical trials are required to estimate long-term efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Robot-assisted pelvic fracture surgery is a leading-edge development that has the ability to improve patient outcomes and the delivery of trauma care.",Ge L; Wang L; Duan L; Zhang T,"Department of Traumatic Orthopedics, Jinan Third People's Hospital, Jinan, China.","Computer assisted surgery (Abingdon, England)",2026-01-16,10.1080/24699322.2026.2615212,3.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract),Pelvic Fractures; Robotic-assisted Surgery; Surgical Navigation; Orthopedic Trauma; Minimally Invasive Fixation
41525612,FocFormer-UNet: UNet With Focal Modulation and Transformers for Ultrasound Needle Tracking Using Photoacoustic Ground Truth.,"Ultrasound (US)-guided needle tracking is a critical procedure for various clinical diagnoses and treatment planning, highlighting the need for improved visualization methods to enhance accuracy. While deep learning (DL) techniques have been employed to boost needle visibility in US images, they often rely heavily on manual annotations or simulated datasets, which can introduce biases and limit real-world applicability. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging, known for its high contrast capabilities, offers a promising solution by providing superior needle visualization compared to conventional US images. In this work, we present FocFormer-UNet, a DL network that leverages PA images of the needle as ground truth for training, eliminating the need for manual annotations. This approach significantly improves needle localization accuracy in US images, reducing the reliance on time-consuming manual labeling. FocFormer-UNet achieves excellent needle localization accuracy, demonstrated by a modified Hausdorff distance of 1.43 1.23 and a targeting error of 1.22 1.14 on human clinical dataset, indicating minimal deviation from actual needle positions. Our method offers robust needle tracking across diverse US systems, improving the precision and reliability of US-guided needle insertion procedures. It holds great promise for advancing AI-driven clinical support tools in medical imaging. The following is the source code: https://github.com/DeeplearningBILAB/FocFormer-UNet.

41538792,Preferences for an Experience Sampling Method-Based Tool as an Adjunct to Usual Treatment in Patients With Problem Substance Use: Qualitative Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mobile health tools that use the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) appear to be a promising tool to streamline and improve the treatment of substance use disorders. However, patient involvement in the development of these tools is uncommon, and research on the preferences of people being treated for substance use disorders has been scarce. In the scope of the European Union IMMERSE (Implementing Mobile Mental health Recording Strategy for Europe) consortium, an ESM-based tool for Digital Mobile Mental Health (DMMH) was first codeveloped and later tested in 4 European countries.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to achieve an understanding of preferences for features of DMMH among mental health service users with problem substance use.<h4>Methods</h4>In 4 European countries, service users were recruited for a semistructured qualitative interview, which started with the presentation of a prototype of the DMMH. Data analysis was performed through directed qualitative content analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The analytical sample consisted of 12 (5 female, 6 male, and 1 nonbinary person) participants with problem substance use aged 18-50 years. There were 4 participants from Slovakia, 3 from Belgium, 4 from Germany, and 1 from Scotland. Patient preferences were classified into 7 categories: notifications, questions, user interface, functionality changes, visualizations, sharing data with clinicians, and sharing data with others. The proposed intensive notification schedule was deemed acceptable by service users as long as the questionnaire is short. Participants expressed a preference for open-text response options, Ecological Momentary Interventions, and options for individual customization of several elements of the tool. Data visualization was considered an important aid for communication with clinicians, with whom all participants wanted to share data obtained with DMMH. The possibility of sharing data with other people depended on the quality of the relationship with them.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In the development of ESM-based mobile health tools for people with problem substance use, their preferences for content, functionality, and appearance of the tools should be considered so they match patients' treatment needs.",Kurilla A; Čavojská N; Ikegwuonu T; Nemčíková M; Schulte-Strathaus JC; Uyttebroek L; Beames JR; Breznoščáková D; Dančík D; Hajdúk M; Heretik A; Izáková Ľ; Katreniaková Z; Myin-Germeys I; Pečeňák J; Reininghaus U; Schick A; Wolters M,"Department of Psychology, Faculty of Arts, Comenius University Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia.",JMIR formative research,2026-01-15,10.2196/79510,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Qualitative Research; Substance Use; Experience Sampling Method; Ecological Momentary Assessment; Mhealth; User Preferences; Digital Mental Health
41528906,Automated Orthognathic Surgery Planning based on Shape-Aware Morphology Prediction and Anatomy-Constrained Registration.,"Orthognathic surgery demands precise preoperative planning to achieve optimal functional and aesthetic results, yet current practices remain labor-intensive and highly dependent on surgical expertise. To address these challenge, we propose OrthoPlanner, a novel two-stage framework for automated orthognathic surgical planning. In the first stage, we develop JawFormer, a shape sensitive transformer network that predicts postoperative bone morphology directly from preoperative 3D point cloud data. Built upon a point cloud encoder-decoder architecture, the network integrates anatomical priors through a region-based feature alignment module. This enables precise modeling of structural changes while preserving critical anatomical features. In the second stage, we introduce a symmetry-constrained rigid alignment algorithm that automatically outputs the precise translation and rotation of each osteotomized bone segment required to match the predicted morphology. This ensures bilateral anatomical consistency and facilitates interpretable surgical plans. Compared with existing approaches, our method achieves superior quantitative performance and enhanced visualization results, as demonstrated by 65 experiments on real clinical datasets. Moreover, OrthoPlanner significantly reduces planning time and manual workload, while ensuring reproducible and clinically acceptable outcomes.",Guo Y; Li C; Li H; Ge W; Zeng B; Liu J; Wan T; Zhang S; Chen X,,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2026-01-13,10.1109/tip.2026.3651981,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

However, existing evidence to support their application remains unclear. Therefore, to address this gap, this comprehensive scoping review will be performed to provide an overview of the available evidence on CPE preparations.<h4>Objective</h4>This review aims to provide the evidence profile for oral CPEs. This study will elucidate the current state of the evidence with respect to these medicines and identify research gaps. The detailed steps for conducting this review are outlined in this protocol. This review will contribute to a better understanding of CPEs.<h4>Methods</h4>This review will include clinical studies of CPEs irrespective of study design. The frameworks described by Arksey and O'Malley, Levac et al, and the Joanna Briggs Institute will be used to guide this scoping review. This review will involve six steps: (1) identifying the research question; (2) collecting information about CPEs from national related drug catalogs; (3) searching MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases from inception to February 2025 to identify relevant publications; (4) screening the literature against the eligibility criteria; (5) extracting data using a predefined standardized data extraction form; and (6) summarizing, discussing, analyzing, and reporting the results. We will also present the results via data visualization techniques.<h4>Results</h4>We will synthesize data on CPEs by conducting the scoping review, drawing the evidence maps, identifying the clinical characteristics of CPEs and how they relate to the adverse events, and highlighting the limitations and gaps in the literature.

41527396,Addressing Perceived Barriers to Achieving Competency in Clinical Endodontics: A Mixed-Methods Study.,"<h4>Purpose/objectives</h4>The aim of this study was to assess predoctoral dental students' satisfaction with faculty-created educational content, aimed at reducing perceived barriers to achieving clinical competency in endodontics.<h4>Methods</h4>This mixed-methods study was conducted with third (D3)- and fourth (D4)-year dental students at New York University College of Dentistry. Focus groups were held to collect qualitative data after initial drafts of clinical instructional videos were made. Surveys were then sent to four randomized groups of D3 and D4 students to collect quantitative data regarding satisfaction with final versions of the instructional videos.<h4>Results</h4>Qualitative data indicated that D3 and D4 students valued different things when evaluating the instructional videos. D3 students were likely to express positive feedback about background information and the explanation of fundamental concepts. Alternatively, D4 students were more likely to express positive feedback about the enhanced visualization that filming through the clinical operating microscopes afforded. Both groups were adept at pointing out inconsistencies between the presented video content and their formal, didactic curriculum. Quantitative data indicated that all respondents (100%) would be willing to watch these videos if they were integrated into their dental school curriculum. Student respondents indicated relatively equal preferences between having the videos published on YouTube/social media (51%) or on an NYU-affiliated platform (49%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Students expressed satisfaction with faculty-created educational videos, with D3 and D4 students valuing different aspects of the content.

41528907,MSHANet: A Multiscale Hybrid Attention Network for Motor Imagery EEG Decoding.,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has significant applications in neuro rehabilitation and motor function restoration, especially for patients with stroke or spinal cord injury. Motor imagery electroencephalog-raphy (MI-EEG) is widely used in BCIs, but its nonlinear dynamics and inter-subject variability limit decoding accuracy. In this paper, a multiscale hybrid attention network (MSHANet) for MI-EEG decoding, which consists of spatiotemporal feature extraction (STFE), talking head self-attention (THSA), dynamic squeeze-and-excitation attention (DSEA), and a temporal convolutional network (TCN), is proposed. MSHANet was evaluated via within-subject experiments using BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b, as well as EEGMMID, achieving decoding accuracies of 83.56%, 89.75%, and 75.66%, respectively. In cross-subject experiments on the three datasets, the mode lattained accuracies of 69.93% on BCI-2a, 81.85% on BCI-2b, and 79.67% on EEGMMID. In addition, we propose an electrode spatial structure-aware encoder. This technique encodes the spatial positions of electrodes in the original data, enabling the model to obtain richer spatial electrode information at the input stage. In within-subject and cross-subject tasks on BCI-2a, this encoding improved the decoding performance by 2.83% and 2.91%, respectively. Visualization was also employed to elucidate feature distributions and the effec tiveness of its attention mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that MSHANet performs exceptionally well in MI-EEG decoding tasks and has high potential for clinical applications, particularly in neurorehabilitation and motor function reconstruction.",Zhao Y; Cao D; Yu H; Liang G; Chen Z,,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2026-01-13,10.1109/tbme.2026.3653824,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41534111,Impact of fine-grained learning rate configuration on the performance of medical image segmentation models.,"Research on deep learning for medical image segmentation has shifted from single-modality networks to multimodal data fusion. Updating the parameters of such deep learning models is crucial for accurate segmentation predictions. Although existing optimizers can perform global parameter updates, the fine-grained initialization of learning rates across different network hierarchies and its influence on segmentation performance has not been sufficiently explored. To address this, we conducted a series of experiments showing that the initialization of a differentiated learning rate across network layers directly affected the performance of medical image segmentation models. To determine the optimal initial learning rate for each network level, we summarized a general statistical relationship between early-stage training results and the model's final optimal performance. In this paper, we proposed a fine-grained learning rate configuration algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we evaluated 10 segmentation models on three benchmark datasets: the colon polyp segmentation dataset CVC-ClinicDB, the gastrointestinal polyp dataset Kvasir-SEG, and the breast tumor segmentation dataset BUSI. The models that achieved the most significant improvement in mIoU on these three datasets were H-vmunet, MSRUNet, and H-vmunet, with increases of 3.87%, 4.67%, and 6.22%, respectively. Additionally, we validated the generalization and transferability of the proposed algorithm using a thyroid nodule segmentation dataset and a skin lesion segmentation dataset. Finally, a series of analyses, including segmentation result analysis, feature map visualization, training process analysis, computational overhead analysis, and clinical relevance analysis, confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

41539470,BTS-Net: Barlow Twins-based Superresolution for 7T Human Brain MRI.,"This study aimed to develop and validate a Barlow Twins-based superresolution diffusion network (BTS-Net) for 7T human brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) superresolution (SR). A paired 3T-7T human brain MRI database was constructed from 50 healthy adult participants (26 females; 52.0%; age range: 27-68 years; median age: 38 years), with anonymized scans. To develop BTS-Net, we employed Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning (SSL) method, in a latent diffusion model (LDM) to enhance feature representation learning for SR from 3T MRI to 7T-like (BTS-7T) MRI. The image quality of the 3T, 7T, LDM-7T, and BTS-7T MRI was evaluated using the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index measure, and normalized root mean squared error. The paired t-test was used to evaluate the mean difference between each imaging group. The three-dimensional structural fidelity was evaluated in 14 anatomical regions (the bilateral thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens) using voxel-based morphometry. An external dataset consisting of 10 healthy participants was used to validate BTS-Net by performing identical SR, image quality, and volumetric analyses. In both the in-house and external validation datasets, BTS-7T MRI exhibited superior image quality across all three metrics compared to 3T MRI. Ground-truth-based error maps showed that BTS-7T images displayed qualitatively improved anatomical fidelity compared to 3T images. There were no statistically significant differences in volumetry between 10 (in-house) and 11 (validation) of the 14 anatomical regions. The right hippocampus, putamen, and amygdala volumes showed significantly higher agreement in BTS-7T images of the in-house dataset; whereas the bilateral putamen, right thalamus and amygdala volumes showed significantly higher agreement in the validation dataset. This study highlights the potential of BTS-Net to enhance both qualitative visualization and quantitative analysis of 3T brain MRI, with possible applicability to early neurodegenerative conditions characterized by subtle morphological changes. Therefore, additional research using larger patient datasets could aid the possible adoption of this technology in clinical settings.",Myong Y; Yoon D; Kim YG; Sim Y; Cho JH; Song Y; Cho M; Oh BM; Kim S,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.",NeuroImage,2026-01-13,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2026.121717,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Diffusion model; Brain Mri; Self-supervised Learning; Barlow Twins; Generative Ai; Mri Superresolution
41540300,"Comparative effectiveness, safety, and cost of laparoscopic versus robotic minimally invasive cholecystectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","For over 3 decades, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been established as the standard surgical treatment for gallstone disease. Robotic cholecystectomy (RC) has emerged as an innovative alternative designed to overcome technical limitations of LC, offering enhanced visualization, improved instrument articulation, and superior ergonomics. Despite increasing global adoption, robust comparative evidence regarding operative outcomes, complication rates, patient-centered metrics, and economic impact remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes the most recent evidence through 2025 to provide a comprehensive comparison of the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of LC versus RC. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception through December 2024, supplemented by manual searches through January 2025. Randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, and retrospective cohort studies comparing LC and RC in adults were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data on patient demographics, operative outcomes, complications, length of hospital stay, patient-reported outcomes, and cost metrics. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for randomized trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Meta-analyses were performed for key outcomes, including operative time, blood loss, complications, conversion rates, and hospital stay duration. Heterogeneity was addressed using random-effects models, and subgroup analysis was performed based on study design and geographic region. Population-level context was provided using national databases, including the U.S. National Inpatient Sample (NIS), ACS NSQIP, and Medicare claims. A potential limitation is the exclusion of non-English language studies. 38 studies including over 412,000 patients were analyzed. LC accounted for approximately 85-95% of all cholecystectomy procedures globally, while RC utilization increased from < 1 to 3-26% across regions by 2024. Pooled analysis showed longer operative times for RC in Western centers (75 vs. 60 min; p < 0.001), whereas some Asian institutions reported shorter times with RC (22 vs. 33 min; p = 0.0025). Pooled analysis indicated a higher rate of bile duct injury with RC (0.72% vs. 0.23%; relative risk 3.12, 95% CI 2.34-3.91; p < 0.001) although this finding should be interpreted with caution due to potential confounders, such as early learning curve effects and coding variability in administrative data. RC demonstrated a lower risk of serious complications (odds ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.98), reduced conversion to open surgery (odds ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.32-0.61), and decreased likelihood of hospitalization ≥ 24 h (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.71-0.81). Overall hospital stay was similar between approaches (1.4-2.7 days). RC incurred higher costs ($5000-6000 vs. $2000-3000 per case; European centers: €2088 vs. €1726). Subgroup analysis suggested potential technical advantages of RC in obese patients or those with complex anatomy, with improved patient-reported outcomes, including pain and quality of life. While both LC and RC are established minimally invasive approaches, the choice between them is nuanced. LC remains the standard of care for most patients due to its proven efficacy and cost-effectiveness. RC offers potential benefits in complex cases and may improve patient-reported outcomes, but it is associated with significantly higher costs and, based on current data, an increased rate of bile duct injury. Optimal approach selection should consider patient characteristics, surgeon expertise, and institutional resources. Future high-quality studies are needed to clarify the safety profile of RC and define its optimal role in clinical practice.",Coco D; Leanza S,"Department of General Surgery, Giglio Hospital Foundation, Cefalu', Italy. webcostruction@msn.com.",Journal of robotic surgery,2026-01-16,10.1007/s11701-025-02863-8,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Meta-analysis; Systematic review; Health Economics; Surgical Outcomes; Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy; Gallstone Disease; minimally invasive surgery; Robotic Cholecystectomy

Methodologies based on the navigation of fluorescent probes for enabling both preoperative visualization of hepatic status and intraoperative delineation of lesion margins have been challenging in clinical applications. This study presents a persistently luminescent NIR-II fluorescent probe, DPTQ08-IDT polymer dots (Pdots), for real-time intraoperative visualization to guide hepatic resection and hepatic ischemia-reperfusion hemodynamic observation. The NIR-II DPTQ08-IDT Pdots emitted at 1050 nm were derived from donor (D)-acceptor (A) structured polymer DPTQ08-IDT, followed by coassembly with folic acid (FA). This probe exhibits a specific binding ability to folate receptor alpha (FRα), which is overexpressed in hepatic tumor cells. Through the specific targeted binding between FA and FRα, the probe achieves rapid hepatic accumulation and robust fluorescence signals in the NIR-II region. The proposed DPTQ08-IDT Pdots provide precise intraoperative guidance for hepatic resection via NIR-II fluorescence imaging. Additionally, this probe facilitates the observation of circulatory dynamics during hepatic ischemia-reperfusion, offering valuable insights into hepatic hemodynamics. This study advances liver-targeted Pdot-based fluorescent probes in the clinical application of liver diseases.",Shi Z; Zhang X; Sun J; Gao F,"Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Materials and Chemical Measurement, Laboratory of Functionalized Molecular Solids, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu 241002, P.

41527008,Live imaging of skin immunity using two-photon microscopy: a short review.,"Two-photon excitation microscopy has become an important technique in dermatologic research, providing high-resolution imaging of living skin and its immune responses. Unlike conventional histology, two-photon microscopy allows direct observation of living tissues in real time at cellular resolution. This method enables the visualization of keratinocyte organization, skin appendages such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and the vascular, lymphatic, and neural networks within the dermis. It has also revealed dynamic immune processes in the skin. Clinical application is still limited by safety concerns and the high cost of equipment. Nonetheless, strategies based on autofluorescence, melanin scattering, and second harmonic generation (SHG) have been explored to visualize collagen and fibrosis in the dermis.

41537966,[Robotic vs. laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal tumors].,"Robot-assisted surgical techniques have become increasingly established in general and visceral surgery over the past 15 years. This also applies to adrenalectomy, a purely resective procedure that does not require complex reconstruction. The current standard remains minimally invasive surgery, performed either laparoscopically or retroperitoneoscopically. Do a number of perceived advantages-such as stable three-dimensional visualization, articulated instruments, and an additional ""hand"" for the surgeon-justify the still considerably higher costs of robotic-assisted surgery? Current evidence suggests minor benefits of robotic surgery in certain operative and complication-related parameters, although these advantages appear to have limited relevance in everyday clinical practice.

41535320,Hyper-angulated (Glidescope) versus intermediate-angled (UED-A) videolaryngoscopy for routine tracheal intubation in adults: a prospective randomized controlled trial.,"Videolaryngoscopy (VL) has become the gold standard for airway management. However, performance differences among blade geometries-especially between hyper-angulated and intermediate-angled designs-remain underexplored in routine airway management. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing a hyper-angulated videolaryngoscope (GlideScope) and a novel intermediate-angled device (UED-A) during elective tracheal intubation of sixty adult patients. Patients were randomized to either device, with total intubation time as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included first-pass success, time to glottic visualization, number of attempts, external manipulation, Cormack-Lehane grade, adverse events, and user satisfaction. All patients were successfully intubated. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups in total intubation time (UED-A: 30.9 ± 13.8 s vs. GlideScope: 29.5 ± 13.0 s; p = 0.73), time to glottic visualization (UED-A: 12.9 ± 4.7 s vs. GlideScope: 13.5 ± 5.4 s; p = 0.74), or first-pass success (UED-A: 93% vs. GlideScope: 97%; p > 0.99). Other secondary outcomes were also comparable between devices. In routine adult tracheal intubation, the intermediate-angled UED-A videolaryngoscope demonstrated a non-inferior performance to GlideScope, indicating that both devices offer similarly effective and user-friendly options for standard airway management. This suggests that intermediate-angled UED-A videolaryngoscope may serve as viable alternatives to hyper-angulated GlideScope in clinical practice.

41524852,Ultrasound-guided infiltration of the pudendal nerve: a technical approach for neuropathic pain management.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Pudendal neuropathy is a debilitating condition often underdiagnosed due to its complex clinical presentation and overlapping symptoms with other pelvic disorders. This review aims to provide an updated synthesis of anatomical, clinical, and technical aspects of ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve infiltration, highlighting its diagnostic and therapeutic relevance in neuropathic pelvic pain.<h4>Methods</h4>A narrative analysis was conducted of the pudendal nerve's anatomy, etiologies of neuropathy, clinical manifestations, diagnostic tools, and image-guided intervention strategies. Particular attention was dedicated to high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) for anatomical visualization and to the technical considerations underlying perineural injection procedures.<h4>Results</h4>Perineural infiltration of the pudendal nerve provides immediate, partial pain relief after anesthetic administration, with the addition of corticosteroids contributing to sustained relief. Ultrasound guidance minimizes complications and has proven superior to traditional landmark-based approaches. The technique demonstrates feasibility, safety, and reproducibility in clinical practice, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, clinical results have varied, and repeated sessions or integration with multimodal strategies, including physical therapy, drug therapy, and lifestyle modifications, have often been required.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve infiltration is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective technique for both diagnosis and treatment of pudendal neuropathy. While offering rapid pain relief and confirming nerve involvement, infiltrations should be considered as part of a broader multimodal management strategy. Future directions include standardization of protocols, refinement of imaging guidance, and exploration of novel injectates or regenerative therapies to optimize long-term outcomes.",Vita F; Donati D; Vender F; Tedeschi R; Stella SM; Drago A; Galletti S; Langone L; Miceli M; Faldini C,"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.",Journal of ultrasound,2026-01-12,10.1007/s40477-025-01106-8,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Neuropathic pain; pudendal nerve; Nerve block; Pelvic Pain; Ultrasound-guided Injection

However, the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear, as no study has definitively linked them to symptoms. Although the localization and visualization of the medial plantar nerve using ultrasound have been documented, its cross-sectional area has not yet been utilized to assess thickening at this specific site. The study aimed to assess the frequency and specific locations of MPPDN thickening in asymptomatic individuals and to identify associated characteristics.In this prospective study, high-resolution ultrasound examination of the MPPDN was performed on asymptomatic volunteers. The cross-sectional areas and their changes along the course of the nerve are evaluated descriptively. Potential contributing demographic factors in participants are captured.56 asymptomatic volunteers, 30 women and 26 men (median age: 28, range: 20-69) participated in this study. 22 individuals (39.3%) showed thickening of the MPPDN at the interphalangeal joint either in one or both feet. More participants above the median population age of 28 showed thickening of the MPPDN (15 [57.7%] versus 7 [23.3%] p = 0.009).Thickening of the MPPDN is frequently observed in asymptomatic individuals, with the likelihood of these findings increasing with age.

41528178,Spatiotemporal Imaging of miRNA in Granulosa Cells from Patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome by Near-Infrared Light-Activated DNA Nanoprobes.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive disorder in women. MicroRNA (miRNA) plays important regulatory roles in PCOS development, but its biological mechanism remains poorly understood. Innovating the visualization methods of miRNA has great significance for studying the genesis and development of PCOS. Here, we report near-infrared (NIR) light-triggerable DNA nanoprobes (termed as LT-DP) for visualizing miRNA-103-associated molecular mechanisms in clinical ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) of PCOS patients. An amplified fluorescence signal of the LT-DP nanoprobes occurs only when the catalytic hairpin assembly amplification reaction is triggered by NIR light and target miRNA, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity of miRNA-103 imaging in human granulosa-like tumor cells (KGN). Attributable to its imaging capability, LT-DP nanoprobes discriminate GCs of insulin resistant (IR) and non-IR PCOS patients with differential miRNA-103 expression. We further investigated the miRNA-103-associated molecular mechanisms and observed that the upregulation of miRNA-103 in PCOS patients promotes the development of ovarian IR by inhibiting the IRS1/PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway. Additionally, the tracking of miRNA-103 expression reveals that metformin (Met) could relieve the ovarian IR by modulating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway. The LT-DP nanoprobes demonstrate clinical potential and provide a strategy to reveal the disease mechanisms.",Cheng D; Ding J; Zhang B; Liu S; Zhang X; Xie C; Zhang Y; Gao Z; Zhang F; Song E; Yin T; Yang Y; Yuan Q,"College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Polymers of Ministry of Education & Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and Hubei Clinic Research center for Assisted Reproductive Technology and Embryonic Development, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, P.

41001718,Illuminating liver fibrosis: recent progress in the design and applications of highly sensitive fluorescent probes.,"Liver fibrosis involves excessive, disorganized extracellular matrix deposition in the liver, critically driving progression from chronic liver disease to cirrhosis and determining patient prognosis. Although histological examination of liver tissue biopsies continues to serve as the most reliable diagnostic approach, the development of precise detection methods remains crucial for enabling timely therapeutic interventions and improving patient management. Recent advances in fluorescent probes have transformed the detection of liver fibrosis, enabling real-time, non-invasive visualization of biomarkers and microenvironmental changes. Based on its design strategy, targeted objects and functional characteristics, this review systematically classifies state-of-the-art fluorescent probes into five categories: probes directly targeting liver fibrosis markers, enzyme-activated probes, microenvironment-responsive probes, intracellular targeting probes, and multifunctional theranostic probes. Among them, near-infrared II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) imaging and genetically encoded probes boost molecular precision and resolution, yet clinical application faces challenges from limited tissue penetration and poor biocompatibility. Consequently, future research in this field will concentrate on the development of NIR II probes, the discovery of biomarkers in biofluids, and the design of new therapeutic interventions.

41534770,Videolaryngoscopy versus Direct Laryngoscopy for Tracheal Intubation by Anesthesia Residents in the operating room: the Randomized Multicenter VILARE Trial Protocol.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Tracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopy with a Macintosh blade remains the standard technique in the operating room. However, this method requires precise anatomical alignment and direct visualization of the glottis, which can be challenging for anesthesia residents with limited experience. Multiple intubation attempts are associated with an increased risk of complications. Videolaryngoscopy allows indirect visualization of the glottis and enables real-time supervision and feedback during the procedure, potentially improving safety and facilitating learning. Although videolaryngoscopy has shown benefits in difficult airway scenarios and in experienced hands, evidence is limited on whether it improves first-pass success and reduces complications when used by anesthesia residents in patients without predicted airway difficulty. The aim of this study is to compare first-pass intubation success with videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy when performed by anesthesia residents in the operating room.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>The VILARE trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label study. A total of 1008 adult patients undergoing elective or urgent surgery under general anesthesia, without predictors of difficult airway, will be randomized to undergo tracheal intubation using either a standard Macintosh direct laryngoscope or a Macintosh videolaryngoscope on the first attempt. All tracheal intubations will be performed by anesthesia residents. The primary endpoint is successful intubation on the first attempt. Secondary outcomes time for successful tracheal intubation, attempts for successful intubation, laryngoscopic vision with the modified Cormack-Lehane scale, need of adjuvant airway devices for intubation, subjective difficulty of intubation, and complications during tracheal intubation (e.g., desaturation, dental trauma).<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study protocol was approved November 28, 2024, by the Ethics Committee of Galicia, Spain (CEI-SL, code No. 2024/394).and was registered into the Clinicaltrials.gov clinical trials registry with No. NCT06842082. Informed consent is required. The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at one or more scientific conferences.

41529265,A Macrophage-Specific PET Tracer for Grading Acute Liver Injury.,"Accurate assessment of acute liver injury (ALI) is hindered by a lack of reliable biomarkers. Addressing this, we developed a PET tracer, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-VUIIS1008, designed to specifically target the translocator protein (TSPO) on activated macrophages during ALI progression. The probe enabled noninvasive visualization and quantification of hepatic macrophages in preclinical models. In healthy mice, its low molecular weight facilitated rapid hepatobiliary clearance, yielding a minimal liver background (%ID/g <sub>liver</sub> = 4.95 ± 0.49 at 0.5 h). Conversely, injured livers exhibited a pathology-driven shift to TSPO-mediated retention that correlated strongly with histopathological severity (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.8155, <i>p</i> <0.0001). This dynamic transition allowed sensitive discrimination of disease progression across two distinct ALI models.

41525676,Endoscope-Assisted Vitrectomy for Bleb-Related Endophthalmitis: A Case Series.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To report three cases of bleb-related endophthalmitis (BRE) treated with endoscope-assisted vitrectomy and to describe the surgical approach and clinical outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively reviewed three patients who developed BRE after glaucoma filtering surgery. All patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with endoscopic guidance using a 25-gauge endoscope, removal of avascular filtering blebs. Intraoperative findings, postoperative courses, and visual outcomes were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Endoscope-assisted vitrectomy enabled visualization of the peripheral vitreous despite corneal edema. In all cases, the infection resolved without recurrence. Postoperative visual acuity improved and exceeded previously reported averages. In one case, endoscopy revealed peripheral retinal degeneration, which was treated intraoperatively with laser photocoagulation, thereby preventing retinal detachment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Endoscope-assisted vitrectomy may be a useful surgical approach for treating BRE, particularly in cases complicated by corneal edema. The technique allows precise peripheral vitreous removal and facilitates early identification of retinal pathology.",Otsubo M; Konno S; Konno A; Yokota H; Nagaoka T,"Department of Ophthalmology, Asahikawa Medical University, Hokkaido, Japan.",Retinal cases & brief reports,2026-01-12,10.1097/icb.0000000000001867,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Endophthalmitis; Filtering Bleb; Glaucoma Surgery; Bleb-related Endophthalmitis; Endoscopic Vitrectomy
41545785,Diagnostic and therapeutic utility of ethiodized oil-based lymphangiography in pelvic and groin lymphatic leaks.,"<h4>Background</h4>Pelvic and groin lymphoceles and lymphatic leaks remain challenging postsurgical complications. Ethiodized-oil (lipiodol) lymphangiography has been increasingly utilized as a combined diagnostic and therapeutic modality, but published experience with lipiodol-only management in this setting is limited. While transnodal glue embolization is well established, evidence on its long-term outcomes and safety profile remains sparse, with particular concerns regarding the potential risk of lymphedema. These gaps highlight the need for further evaluation of lymphangiography alone as a minimally invasive treatment option.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective study included patients who underwent lymphangiography between January 2019 and March 2023 for persistent symptomatic pelvic lymphoceles or groin lymphatic leaks. Imaging findings, drain output, prior interventions, and clinical outcomes were reviewed. Technical success was defined as adequate visualization of the targeted lymphatic vessels. Clinical success was defined as resolution or minimal residual leak without need for further treatment.<h4>Results</h4>Ten patients (5 males, median age, 69 years) underwent lymphangiography for pelvic lymphoceles (n = 7) or groin lymphatic leaks (n = 3). The median interval from surgery to INL was 67.5 days (range, 12-108). Three patients had previously undergone surgical interventions, and four patients had undergone sclerotherapy without clinical improvement before INL was performed. Technical success was achieved in all patients (100%) with identification of lymphatic leak in all patients. Clinical success was achieved in 7 patients (70%) following lymphangiography alone, with a median time to resolution of 5.5 days (range, 5-12 days) and no immediate adverse events.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Lymphangiography using ethiodized oil contrast is a safe, and potentially effective minimally invasive treatment for pelvic and groin lymphatic leaks. These findings support a stepwise management approach, using lymphangiography as a first-line intervention before escalating to intranodal glue embolization.",Amarneh MA; Amro S; Ferris K; Amoedo M; Alomari AI,"Division of Vascular and Interventional Radiology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.

41538701,Intrascleral and Peripheral Retinal Crystals in Bietti Crystalline Dystrophy.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To report a case of intrascleral crystal deposition in a patient with genetically confirmed Bietti Crystalline Dystrophy (BCD).<h4>Methods</h4>Case report of a 51-year-old Asian male with high myopia, nyctalopia since early adulthood and progressive visual decline. Clinical examination, fundus photography, infrared reflectance, spectral-domain OCT, and ultra-widefield swept-source (SS) OCT were performed. Genetic testing was performed to evaluate for pathogenic mutations in CYP4V2.<h4>Results</h4>Pseudocolor fundus photography revealed yellow-white crystalline deposits primarily in the posterior pole with poor visualization of crystals more peripherally. Cross-sectional OCT localized hyperreflective deposits predominantly at the retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch's membrane complex, with additional foci in the outer and inner retina, accompanied by chorioretinal atrophy. Intrascleral crystals were also identified on spectral domain OCT. Ultra-widefield OCT extended the assessment beyond the vascular arcades, revealing peripheral zones of atrophy and scattered crystals not visible on standard field scans.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Intrascleral crystal distribution may aid in broadening the phenotypic spectrum of BCD, supporting more accurate diagnosis and contributing to the understanding of its pathophysiology. UWF and multimodal imaging provide complementary insights into BCD extent and crystal localization. Infrared reflectance outperforms pseudocolor photography for crystal detection, while UWF-OCT expands structural evaluation into the periphery, potentially improving monitoring strategies.",Quarta A; Alhelaly M; Abbasgholizadeh R; Soylu C; Chujo S; Corradetti G; Sadda SR,"Department of Neurosciences, Imaging and Clinical Sciences, University ""G. d'Annunzio"" Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy.",Retinal cases & brief reports,2026-01-15,10.1097/icb.0000000000001870,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cyp4v2; Bietti Crystalline Dystrophy; Ultra-widefield Optical Coherence Tomography; Infrared Reflectance
41535020,Short-TR Acquisition Time-of-flight MR Angiography with Deep Learning Reconstruction: Technical Feasibility and Initial Clinical Evaluation in Moyamoya Disease.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To develop and evaluate short-TR acquisition time-of-flight (STRA-TOF) MR angiography (MRA), which combines an optimized STRA with deep learning-based reconstruction to achieve scan-time reduction while maintaining image quality in the visualization of intracranial arteries.<h4>Methods</h4>Ten healthy volunteers and 3 patients with moyamoya disease were examined using 3D TOF MRA with the clinical moyamoya protocol and 2 STRA-TOF protocols employing 4-slab (STRA4) and 9-slab (STRA9) configurations. STRA-TOF employed a TR of approximately 10 ms with variable-density Poisson-disc sampling and unrolled deep learning reconstruction. Bloch equation simulations validated the theoretical basis for STRA. Quantitative assessment included SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio measurements. Two radiologists independently evaluated image quality using a 3-point scale across 9 vascular territories and overall image quality, with blinded assessment. Statistical analysis was performed using the Friedman test with post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.<h4>Results</h4>STRA-TOF achieved approximately a 50% reduction in scan time compared with conventional protocols. Both STRA sequences demonstrated significantly higher SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio than conventional TOF (P < 0.001). Overall image quality scores were higher for STRA4 and STRA9 compared with conventional TOF in both readers. Across the 9 vascular territories, both readers consistently rated STRA sequences equal to or superior to conventional TOF, particularly for distal branches. In the small patient cohort with moyamoya disease (n = 3), STRA-TOF demonstrated feasibility for visualizing complex arterial pathology, including stenotic vessels, collateral circulation, and postsurgical vascular changes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>STRA-TOF achieved approximately a 50% reduction in scan time while maintaining or improving image quality compared with conventional 3D TOF MRA. This technique addresses the fundamental scan-time limitations of the conventional method, with potential for significant clinical benefits in terms of patient comfort, workflow efficiency, and improved access to intracranial artery evaluation.",Takei N; Fujii K; Zhu X; Inui S; Sakamoto N; Suzuki Y; Wakayama T; Amemiya S; Abe O,"Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",Magnetic resonance in medical sciences : MRMS : an official journal of Japan Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,2026-01-14,10.2463/mrms.mp.2025-0139,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Moyamoya Disease; Intracranial Arteries; Time-of-flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Deep Learning Reconstruction; Scan-time Reduction
41544896,Is identifying the ureter using indocyanine green in severe deep endometriosis always useful?,"<h4>Objective</h4>Fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) has recently gained widespread use in gynecologic surgery and is considered a useful method for facilitation of ureteric identification and dissection during deep endometriosis (DE) surgery [1-3]. However, we encountered a case of DE in which ureteral visualization using intraureteral ICG was inadequate. This video presents clinical details and discusses possible reasons and implications.<h4>Setting</h4>An urban general hospital. Stepwise demonstration with narrated video footage.<h4>Participants</h4>A 42-year-old woman presented with dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain. She had a history of surgery for DE (ovarian cystectomy and uterosacral ligament resection). MRI showed uterine leiomyomas, adenomyosis, bilateral ovarian endometrioma, left hematosalpinx, and DE involving the surface of the rectum and uterosacral ligament.<h4>Interventions</h4>Robot-assisted nerve-sparing hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and complete DE resection was planned using the da Vinci SP. Retrograde intraureteral ICG instillation was performed cystoscopically using ureteral catheters (2.5 mg/mL, 5 mL per side). Due to severe pelvic adhesion and fibrosis, the course of the pelvic ureters could not be identified with ICG fluorescence alone. The non-visualized segment became visible only after careful dissection of fibrotic tissue, and some portions remained non-fluorescent even after complete exposure of the ureter.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Even minimal periureteral fibrosis, as thin as 1-2 mm, can significantly attenuate fluorescence transmission depending on its density [4, 5]. Although intraureteral ICG is a valuable adjunct for ureteral identification during DE surgery, surgeons should be aware of its optical limitations and rely on meticulous anatomical dissection, which remains the cornerstone of safe pelvic surgery.",Kashiwabara T; Kanno K; Iwata T; Andou M,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kurashiki Medical Center, Okayama, Japan.",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2026-01-14,10.1016/j.jmig.2026.01.028,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Indocyanine green; ureteral injury; Pelvic Anatomy; Deep Endometriosis; Ureteral Identification
41534119,Towards quantitative MRI Driving online adaptive MRgRT for lung tumors.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Successful delivery of lung cancer radiotherapy is hindered by respiratory motion, low soft-tissue contrast and anatomical variabilities, often compromising precision. Magnetic Resonance Image-guided Radiotherapy (MRgRT) has emerged as a promising approach, particularly with hybrid MR-Linac systems that offer superior soft-tissue visualization and enable online adaptive radiotherapy (online MRgART).<h4>Purpose</h4>This review synthesizes current evidence for online MRgART in lung cancer and examines emerging roles for quantitative MRI (qMRI). A PubMed search covering the period from January 2020 to September 2025 identified 19 studies, 3 of which focused specifically on quantitative imaging.<h4>Main findings</h4>Online MRgART consistently demonstrated workflow feasibility, frequent online adaptation, improved target coverage while respecting Organs-At-Risk (OARs) constraints and encouraging Local Control (LC) with low high-grade toxicity. qMRI on MR-Linacs, most commonly Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and cine-MRI-derived ventilation/perfusion mapping, showed feasibility and early signals for treatment adaptation, toxicity prediction and response assessment.<h4>Principal conclusions</h4>qMRI studies integrated in online MRgART for lungs are, at present, extremely limited; nevertheless, establishing a clear snapshot of the current state-of-the-art is essential, as this topic is expected to become highly prevalent and of particular interest in the near future. To our knowledge, this is the first review centered on online MRgART for lung tumors, with a dedicated subsection summarizing the nascent evidence on qMRI. Looking ahead, integrating AI-driven motion compensation, auto-segmentation and adaptive replanning with qMRI-enabled biomarkers could standardize workflows and accelerate truly personalized online MRgART. Prospective multi-center studies are needed to validate biomarkers and demonstrate clinical benefit.",Moretti I; Nardini M; Mazzarella C; Romano A; Chiloiro G; Panza G; Galetto M; Tran HE; Zormpas-Petridis K; Boldrini L; Spirito M; Placidi L,"Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.",Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB),2026-01-13,10.1016/j.ejmp.2026.105731,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Lung cancer; Diffusion-weighted Imaging (Dwi); Quantitative Mri (Qmri); Online Adaptive Radiotherapy; Mr-guided Radiotherapy (Mrgrt)
41522696,Quadriceps Coxae-Sparing Modified Posterior Approach to the Hip Joint for Hemiarthroplasty.,"<h4>Background</h4>Various approaches have been described for hip arthroplasty<sup>1-3</sup>. The posterior approach to the hip remains a popular choice for hemiarthroplasty<sup>1</sup>. In the classic description, it involves detachment of the short external rotators, which include the quadriceps coxae (QC) (i.e., piriformis, superior gemellus, obturator internus, and inferior gemellus) along with the obturator externus and quadratus femoris <i>(</i>as needed<i>)</i>. Since the QC are important for joint stability, detachment during the approach is associated with higher rates of postoperative dislocations<sup>4</sup>, even following subsequent surgical repair of the QC. In the study by Stähelin et al.<sup>5</sup>, 15 of 20 repairs involving the QC had failed by 3 months postoperatively, primarily because the repair site could not withstand the forces of normal weight-bearing during the healing phase. Various muscle-sparing modifications of the conventional approach have been described to reduce the propensity for prosthetic dislocation<sup>6-9</sup>. Hanly et al.<sup>9</sup> described the SPAIRE (Sparing Piriformis and Internus, Repair Externus) technique. This minimally invasive modified posterior approach enables the preservation of the QC, possibly representing the greatest extent of muscle and tendon preservation. The advantages of this QC-sparing technique have been demonstrated in clinical studies of hemiarthroplasty<sup>10,11</sup> and total hip arthroplasty<sup>12</sup>.<h4>Description</h4>The patient is anesthetized and placed in a lateral decubitus position. Bolsters are utilized over the pubis and sacral areas to provide stable pelvic orientation. The contralateral limb is flexed at the hip (∼45°) and knee (90°), with adequate padding under the fibular head and lateral malleolus. Another padded bolster is placed between the legs to keep the topmost lower limb in neutral to slight abduction at the hip. The operative limb is flexed at the hip (∼30°), and a 10 to 15-cm straight skin incision is marked on the lateral aspect of hip, centered on the posterolateral tip of the greater trochanter. The deep fascia is opened distally to proximally, incised distally with scissors, and separated proximally with finger dissection. This step creates an intermuscular plane between the gluteus maximus posteriorly and tensor fasciae latae anteriorly. A Charnley hip retractor is applied. Internal rotation of the hip allows identification of the posterior border of the gluteus medius and short external rotators. The fat pad over the QC is swept medially with an abdominal sponge to identify the muscles. A plane is identified between the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus. Next, a plane is developed between the QC and posterior hip capsule with use of a blunt hemostat from inferior to superior. Abduction of the hip just beyond neutral relaxes the QC and allows superior retraction. The quadratus femoris is detached from the trochanteric crest with use of a diathermy needle until the lesser trochanter is visualized. A capsulotomy is performed in a lazy L-shaped manner, with the first limb of the incision along the distal margin of the QC and the second along the base of the femoral neck. The second limb of the incision raises the musculocapsular flap consisting of the obturator externus along the osseous margin with use of a diathermy needle. This musculocapsular flap is tagged with sutures, which helps in its retraction posteriorly to protect the sciatic nerve and later aids in repair. Bipolar hemiarthroplasty is performed in a conventional manner. The musculocapsular flap is repaired transosseously, and the wound is closed in a layered fashion.<h4>Alternatives</h4>Alternatives to this QC-sparing technique include the use of a conventional posterior approach, piriformis-preserving posterior approach, direct lateral approach, modified lateral approach, or direct anterior approach.<h4>Rationale</h4>Preservation of the QC helps improve prosthetic hip stability in internal rotation, possibly because of the preserved proprioception. A minimally invasive approach reduces recovery time during rehabilitation. Preservation of the QC does not hinder visualization or result in component malposition<sup>12</sup>.<h4>Expected outcomes</h4>Ball et al.<sup>10</sup> compared the use of a modified muscle-sparing posterior approach versus a standard lateral approach. The authors reported comparable Oxford Hip Scores at 120 days (p = 0.25). Patient function and mobility were similar at 3 days and 120 days, regardless of the surgical approach. Length of hospital stay and return to pre-fracture place of residence were similar. Mortality rates and quality of life were also similar at 120 days postoperatively. Patients who underwent the modified muscle-sparing posterior approach experienced less pain during the early postoperative period. The mean score on the numeric pain rating scale was 4.4 (standard deviation, 2.8) among patients who underwent the modified muscle-sparing posterior approach versus 5.4 (standard deviation, 3.0) among patients who underwent the standard lateral approach (p = 0.04).<h4>Important tips</h4>Place a padded bolster between the legs to keep the topmost lower limb in neutral to slight abduction at the hip.Develop a plane between the QC and posterior hip capsule with use of a blunt hemostat or a Cobb elevator from inferior to superior in order to help mobilize the QC and release their capsular attachments.Hip abduction just beyond neutral relaxes the QC and allows insertion of a Hohmann retractor deep to the QC in order to protect and lever them superiorly.A small Langenbeck retractor inserted deep to the QC protects them from shredding during broaching. Internal rotation at the hip beyond 90° (in 90° flexion and neutral adduction/abduction) further protects the QC from harm.",Arora S; Gupta P; Sharma M; Meena MK; Khan S; Kashyap A,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi, India.",JBJS essential surgical techniques,2026-01-14,10.2106/jbjs.st.25.00008,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41530631,Learning Health System Implementation: Building a Hub-and-Spoke Model for Hypertension Management Through the QI Hub.,"<h4>Background</h4>In July 2022, the Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) launched a statewide Regional Quality Improvement (QI) Hub program using a hub-and-spoke model to embed Learning Health System (LHS) capabilities in primary care. The Ohio State University (OSU) Hub piloted the approach across ten affiliated sites, aiming to raise overall hypertension control by ≥ 10 percentage points and promote more consistent levels of hypertension control across patient populations by June 2027. This report describes the first 18 months post-implementation.<h4>Methods</h4>A mixed-methods, formative evaluation followed the Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-Sustainment (EPIS) framework. The hub provided centralized data extraction (bi-weekly Epic pulls), an R Shiny dashboard, and tailored coaching on Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles (PDSA) while participating in statewide learning collaboratives. Blood pressure (BP) control rates were tracked with statistical process control (SPC) charts. Site-level logistic regressions tested interaction effects between demographics (non-Hispanic Black vs. White) and implementation period.<h4>Results</h4>Among 22,563 hypertensive adults (73,264 encounters), the baseline centerline was 72.9% controlled BP. Two SPC shifts, April 2024 to 77.3% and July 2024 to 79.1%, produced a + 6.2 percentage-point (+ 8.5%) relative improvement, equating to ~ 4542 additional controlled BP encounters beyond baseline expectations. Site-level absolute changes ranged from -3.9% to + 14.6%. Across sites, six narrowed and four widened the Black-White BP control gap. Site-level sensitivity analysis showed no significant change in the gap. Qualitative data highlighted the importance of near real-time feedback and flexible coaching; staffing turnover constrained progress in several under-resourced clinics.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Implementing a hub-and-spoke LHS model within a large academic health system was feasible and associated with sustained gains in hypertension control over 18 months. Centralized analytics, adaptive QI support, and statewide peer learning were key enablers, whereas workforce instability remained a barrier. Early results support the model's potential to build LHS capacity in primary care, with ongoing work needed to strengthen uniform impact and long-term sustainability.",Alain G; Rush LJ; Summers R; Purdy N; Eramo J; Jonaus S; Cooper K; Nair S; Smarr C; Sneed A; VanBuren A; Teuschler L; Alain J; Quatman-Yates C,"LIFT Lab, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. gabriel.alain@osumc.edu.",Journal of general internal medicine,2026-01-13,10.1007/s11606-025-10152-1,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Hypertension; Quality improvement; Primary Care; Blood Pressure Control; Implementation Science; Hub-and-spoke Model; Population Health Management; Learning Health System; Healthcare Infrastructure
