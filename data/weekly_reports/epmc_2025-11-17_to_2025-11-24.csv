41264440,TrialCompass: Visual Analytics for Enhancing the Eligibility Criteria Design of Clinical Trials.,"Eligibility criteria play a critical role in clinical trials by determining the target patient population, which significantly influences the outcomes of medical interventions. However, current approaches for designing eligibility criteria have limitations to support interactive exploration of the large space of eligibility criteria. They also ignore incorporating detailed characteristics from the original electronic health record (EHR) data for criteria refinement. To address these limitations, we proposed TrialCompass, a visual analytics system integrating a novel workflow, which can empower clinicians to iteratively explore the vast space of eligibility criteria through knowledge-driven and outcome-driven approaches. TrialCompass supports history-tracking to help clinicians trace the evolution of their adjustments and decisions when exploring various forms of data (i.e., eligibility criteria, outcome metrics, and detailed characteristics of original EHR data) through these two approaches. This feature can help clinicians comprehend the impact of eligibility criteria on outcome metrics and patient characteristics, which facilitates systematic refinement of eligibility criteria. Using a real-world dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness of TrialCompass in providing insights into designing eligibility criteria for septic shock and sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. We also discussed the research prospects of applying visual analytics to clinical trials.",Sheng R; Wang X; Wang J; Jin X; Sheng Z; Xu Z; Rajendran S; Qu H; Wang F,,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2025-11-20,10.1109/tvcg.2025.3634803,9.8,"visual analytics(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract); electronic health record(abstract)",
41270265,Interpretation of Health-Smart Home Data and Implications for Clinical Decision-Making: Inductive Content Analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Health-smart home technologies offer real-time sensor-based monitoring of older adult activities of daily living, allowing for early detection of changes in health. The way clinicians interpret and use this data, particularly in visualized formats, such as bar, line, and pie graphs, remains underexplored.<h4>Objective</h4>A qualitative descriptive study design with a quantitative component was used to explore how nurses interpret sensor-derived health data from health-smart homes in 3 cases.<h4>Methods</h4>Using an inductive content analysis approach, we analyzed nurses' qualitative interpretations of existing sensor-derived health data from health-smart homes from 3 older adults living with ambient whole-home sensing. Nurses provided structured written feedback on visualized trends in sensor-derived health data, including activity, sleep, and mobility patterns.<h4>Results</h4>The findings highlight both opportunities and challenges of using sensor-derived health data in older adults' care. Nurses identified key patterns in sleep, mobility, and home engagement, but interpretation difficulties, such as unclear sleep metrics and lack of clinical context, hindered decision-making. Nurses preferred bar and line graphs over pie charts for interpreting these data. Survey results show a statistically significant difference in how nurses rated different graph types (χ²2=17.1, P<.001), with pie charts rated significantly lower than both bar and line graphs (P<.001 and P=.008, respectively). These findings underscore the need for improved data visualization and integration to enhance the clinical utility of sensor-derived health data from health-smart homes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Findings indicate that nurses were able to provide accurate interpretations of the sensor-derived health data from health-smart homes. However, there is a need for improved visualization techniques and clinician training to optimize health-smart home data for early intervention. Standardized approaches to data representation could enhance nurses' ability to detect and act on subtle yet important information about older adults' health changes occurring in home settings.",Dermody G; Cook DJ; Fritz RL,"School of Health, University of the Sunshine Coast, 90 Sippy Downs Drive, Sippy Downs, 4556, Australia, 610451980220.",JMIR nursing,2025-11-21,10.2196/75234,9.8,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Nursing; Content analysis; Data Visualization; Digital Health; Aging-in-place; Health-smart Home
41275191,Development and validation of an interpretable machine learning model for osteoporosis prediction using routine blood tests: a retrospective cohort study.,"<h4>Background</h4>While dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) remains the gold standard for osteoporosis diagnosis, its clinical utility is constrained by cost and accessibility challenges. This study aims to develop a predictive model for osteoporosis using routinely available clinical blood biomarkers, thereby providing an innovative and accessible approach for early detection.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed 8,144 orthopedic inpatients who underwent DXA scans at Panyu Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between January 2022 and December 2023. Demographic characteristics and first 24-hour admission blood parameters were collected. Potential predictors were identified through univariate analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and Boruta algorithm. Ten supervised machine learning algorithms were employed to construct predictive models. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the test cohort. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis provided interpretable visualization of feature contributions.<h4>Results</h4>The cohort was randomly divided into training (n = 5,702) and testing sets (n = 2,442). Feature selection convergence across three methods identified 11 key predictors. The logistic regression model demonstrated superior performance in the testing set (AUC = 0.800), outperforming other algorithms in calibration and clinical utility assessments. SHAP analysis revealed age, gender, uric acid concentration, alkaline phosphatase levels, hemoglobin levels, and neutrophil count as the six most influential predictors. An accessible web-based risk calculator has been deployed at:https://op-lm.shinyapps.io/osteoporosis/.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed an easy-to-use online calculator based on machine learning, which outperforms traditional models, enabling patients to preliminarily screen for osteoporosis using routine blood test results from their health check-ups. This interpretable machine learning model demonstrated promising performance and may assist in improving osteoporosis screening and risk stratification in clinical settings.<h4>Clinical trial number</h4>Not applicable.",Wei Q; Zhan J; Chen X; Huang Q; Li H; Guo W; Liu Z; Chen S; Cai D,"Department of Orthopedics, Panyu Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2025-11-22,10.1186/s12911-025-03292-1,9.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); clinical decision support(kw)",Osteoimmunology; Machine Learning; Clinical Decision Support; Inflammatory Biomarkers; Osteoporosis Prediction

41254277,VR-prep improves visualization of medical data in augmented reality on smartphones.,"Relaying complex anatomical information between clinicians and to patients is challenging in medical routine and might be improved via direct 3D visualization of image series in augmented reality (AR) in portable devices. We devised a workflow for displaying medical imaging data in augmented reality on smartphones, relying solely on open-source products: 'Medical Imaging XR' (MIXR) application, '3D Slicer' software, and 'Fiji'. We designed a pipeline for image transformation and data harmonization (VR-prep) to expedite and optimize the 3D rendering of DICOM series in MIXR. VR-prep significantly reduced the size of image files to be uploaded to MIXR, without sacrificing quality and readability of images. Due to reduced file size, upload and download times onto the mobile device were significantly lower. Our workflow is suitable for CT, MRI, US and PET-CT, whereas MIXR alone only permits CT data. VR-prep is user-friendly and allows for broader integration of medical imaging data sets in AR, to facilitate clinician to clinician and clinician to patient communication. VR-prep relies exclusively in open-source software making it viable to adopt in a broad range of applications from clinical decision-making, patient communication, and medical education.",Böhner AMC; Jacob AM; Bahaaeldin M; Oelmeier L; Isaak A; Pieper CC; Luetkens JA; Kuetting D,"Clinic for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.

41268668,Machine Learning Model for Atherosclerosis Evaluation and Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Based on Coronary CT Angiography-Analysis From the CREATION Registry.,"<h4>Background</h4>Current ASCVD risk prediction tools based on traditional risk factors and the coronary artery calcium score have limitations.<h4>Methods</h4>The CREATION study includes suspected coronary artery disease patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) at Fuwai Hospital between 2016 and 2019. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events defined as a composite end point of all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stroke. Six machine learning survival models were used to create an ASCVD prediction model.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 8431 participants with analyzable CCTA data were included with a median follow-up of 3.68 years, and 319 major adverse cardiac events (3.8%) occurred (mean age: 54.73±10.21 years, 48.2% were male, 50.9% with symptomatic chest pain). Among 6 machine learning models trained with 48 CCTA parameters, XGBoost showed the best performance and was selected for model development. In the training cohort (n=5901, 70%), the XGBoost model significantly outperformed the clinical risk factors and coronary artery calcium score model (area under the curve, 0.903 versus 0.830; <i>P</i><0.001). Testing cohort showed similar performance (area under the curve, 0.899 versus 0.753; <i>P</i><0.001). The CCTA model demonstrates consistent predictive performance across gender (female or male), onset-age (early onset or late-onset), and symptom (asymptomatic or symptomatic) subgroup analysis. The final CCTA model included diameter stenosis, lipid plaque burden and volume, total plaque volume, high-risk plaque, and vessel volume as the most important features. Lipid plaque burden was most strongly associated with major adverse cardiac event (adjusted hazard ratio per 5% increase: 2.524 [95% CI, 2.157-2.996]; <i>P</i><0.001). The incremental value of machine learning CCTA features was consistent across different time points throughout the 1- to 5-year follow-up period. The findings remained unchanged when restricted to a secondary composite end point (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The machine learning model incorporating CCTA plaque quantification, characterization, and stenosis assessment significantly enhanced the predictive capacity for major adverse cardiac events. It provides direct visualization of coronary atherosclerosis and outperforms the traditional risk factors and the coronary artery calcium score model recommended in clinical practice.",Song Y; Xu N; Zheng J; Jia S; Cui C; Zhang Y; Gao L; Gao Z; Chen J; Song L; Yuan J; Lu B; Zhi-Hui H,"Department of Cardiology, Fuwai Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.

41268967,Association Between a Co-Designed Dashboard and Use of Costly Health Services in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease and Advanced Cancer: Propensity Score-Adjusted Difference-in-Differences Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The US health care system faces escalating costs, increasing emphasis on patient autonomy, and a regulatory shift toward patient-centered care and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Leveraging PROs to support shared decision-making has the potential to improve outcomes and reduce health care use for patients with advanced chronic conditions.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to evaluate the impact of a PRO-based clinical dashboard on the use of costly health services among patients with advanced cancer and chronic kidney disease (CKD).<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a quasi-experimental, propensity score-weighted, difference-in-differences analysis using routinely collected data (June 2020 to January 2022) from a large US academic health system. Dashboard users were compared with contemporaneous nonexposed patients matched on clinical criteria. The primary outcomes were unplanned all-cause hospital admissions, potentially avoidable emergency department visits, excess days in acute care within 30 days of discharge, and 7-day readmissions. Cancer-specific secondary outcomes included acute encounters during outpatient chemotherapy, oncology triage use, advance directive completion, and hospice use. CKD-specific outcomes were CKD-related acute care use and disease progression.<h4>Results</h4>In the advanced cancer cohort (dashboard users: n=284; dashboard nonusers: n=917), dashboard use was associated with significantly fewer chemotherapy-related emergency department or hospital encounters (ratio-in-odds ratios 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.75) and a nonsignificant 1.7-percentage point reduction in unplanned admissions (β=-0.017, 95% CI -0.107 to 0.072). Using Firth penalized logistic regression to reduce small sample bias, dashboard use was also associated with significantly higher odds of 7-day readmissions (ratio-in-odds ratios 8.58, 95% CI 2.28-32.32). Among readmissions in the dashboard user group, most (13/14, 93%) were scheduled by clinicians. Excess days in acute care increased by 4 percentage points (β=0.040, 95% CI -0.001 to 0.089). Advance directive completion declined significantly (β=-0.009, 95% CI -0.039 to 0.020). In the CKD cohort (dashboard users: n=365; dashboard nonusers: n=2137), no significant differences were observed for any primary or CKD-specific outcome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In routine oncology practice, a PRO dashboard was associated with fewer acute care encounters during chemotherapy but more planned early readmissions. The dashboard had no measurable effect on patients with CKD. These disease-specific mixed results highlight the need to tailor dashboards to the clinical context and embed them within workflows that can act on real-time PRO information.",Amagai S; Harris A; Mohindra N; Kircher S; Linder JA; Aggarwal V; Peipert JD; Bedjeti K; Mai Q; Barnard C; Coughlin A; O'Connor M; Morken V; Cella D; Jordan N,"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, United States.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-11-21,10.2196/70430,7.4,"dashboard(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Pro; Health Care Cost; Shared Decision-making; Patient-reported Outcome; Dashboard; Pro-based Dashboard

Despite its growing influence, comprehensive bibliometric assessments in this domain remain scarce. This study aims to map the intellectual landscape and research trends of 3D printing in medical education from 2010 to 2025, offering evidence-based guidance for future innovation.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search was conducted in Web of Science Core Collection and PubMed for original articles and reviews related to 3D printing in medical education. CiteSpace was employed to construct and visualise collaboration, co-occurrence, and co-citation networks.<h4>Results</h4>The study included 302 articles from 96 institutions across 49 countries. The United States of America led in publication output, followed by China and Australia. Curtin University, the University of Toronto, and Mayo Clinic were the top three publishing institutions. The most prolific author published 11 papers, while the highest number of cited author as defined by co-citation analysis was 79. ""Anatomical Sciences Education"" was the most published-in and cited journal. The co-citation network analysis identified 12 thematic clusters-spanning medical modelling, anatomical education, and biomechanical testing-interconnected through pivotal high-centrality publications, illustrating the interdisciplinary expansion and evolving applications of 3D printing in medical education. Keyword analysis identified three major research hotspots: skill development and pedagogical validation, clinical surgical planning and doctor-patient communication, and emerging technologies with cross-disciplinary integration.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This bibliometric analysis highlights an ongoing paradigm shift in 3D printing for medical education-from initial technical exploration toward rigorous validation of educational efficacy. Current research hotspots encompass anatomical modelling, surgical simulation, and AI/AR integration. However, persistent challenges such as limited dynamic simulation capabilities, high costs, and the absence of standardised assessment frameworks hinder progress.

41242532,To Keep Us on Track: An Equity Dashboard for the Pediatric Emergency Department.,"<h4>Background</h4>Measuring health care disparities is essential for achieving equity, yet these efforts are often limited to isolated projects. To drive meaningful and sustained change, disparities must be systematically measured and integrated into health care operations. Equity dashboards offer a powerful tool for visualizing disparities, identifying gaps, and guiding interventions. We developed an operational equity dashboard for a pediatric emergency department (PED) to integrate equity metrics into routine decision-making and quality improvement efforts.<h4>Methods</h4>A multidisciplinary team created an interactive dashboard using the business intelligence tool Power BI. The dashboard aggregates electronic health record data and employs statistical process control charts to track key operational metrics over time. To identify equity gaps, filters stratify data by race, ethnicity, and language, and other variables.<h4>Results</h4>The dashboard identified that Hispanic patients waited 12 minutes longer to see a provider than non-Hispanic patients (78 vs 66 minutes), whereas Spanish-speaking patients waited 15 minutes longer than English-speaking patients (81 vs 66 minutes). Disparities were observed primarily among lower-acuity patients; no significant differences were found among higher-acuity patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This equity dashboard embeds health equity considerations into PED operations, enabling real-time identification of disparities and supporting targeted interventions.

41271017,"Lymphedema Imaging and AI: A Review of Diagnostic Modalities, Biomarkers, and Clinical Integration.","Lymphedema, a chronic lymphatic disorder characterized by swelling, fibrosis, and adipose tissue accumulation, requires precise, stage-specific imaging for effective diagnosis and management. This review evaluates conventional imaging modalities, including indocyanine green lymphography (ICG-L), lymphoscintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT), alongside emerging artificial intelligence (AI) applications to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. We analyze their capabilities in assessing lymphatic function and tissue changes through quantitative biomarkers, comparing their strengths across disease stages. ICG-L excels in detecting early lymphatic dysfunction, while MRI and CT provide detailed visualization of advanced fibrotic and adipose changes. AI-driven tools, such as automated segmentation and biomarker quantification, show promise in improving tissue characterization and supporting surgical planning. However, clinical integration of AI is hindered by data heterogeneity, lack of interpretability, and regulatory challenges. To address these, we propose a strategic framework incorporating federated learning for privacy-preserving model training, explainable AI for clinical transparency, and standardized imaging protocols.

41263442,Exploring the Feasibility of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Postoperative Outcome Assessment in Unilateral Cleft Lip Repair: A Pilot Study.,"Primary surgical repair for a cleft lip is often performed around 3 to 4 months of age. Traditional outcome assessments rely heavily on subjective clinical judgment and structured rating tools such as the Cleft Aesthetic Rating Scale (CARS), both of which are limited by inter-rater variability and lack of scalability. This pilot study explores the feasibility of a deep learning (DL) algorithm to assist in postoperative outcome assessment and identify patients at increased risk for revision following unilateral cleft lip repair. The authors developed a convolutional neural network based on the EfficientNet-B1 architecture, trained on a class-balanced data set of 500 standardized postoperative facial photographs labeled using real-world revision outcomes. Rigorous data preprocessing, augmentation, and validation protocols were used to ensure model robustness. The model achieved an accuracy of 74% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.79 on an independent test set, with a recall of 76% for identifying patients needing revision. Confidence score distribution and t-SNE feature space visualization demonstrated reliable class separation and interpretability. Our findings suggest that DL algorithms, when trained on structured clinical data, can offer meaningful support in cleft care. This model serves as an early prototype for AI-assisted triage systems that could aid in identifying revision candidates, particularly in resource-limited or outreach settings.

41250192,Visualising accelerometer-based 24/7 human movement behaviour data: an umbrella review and framework development from the LABDA project.,"<h4>Background</h4>Regular Physical Activity (PA) is important for disease prevention and health promotion. PA has been assessed through surveys, questionnaires, and devices such as accelerometers. Alongside PA, Sedentary Behaviour (SB) and sleep are the main components of 24/7 movement behaviours, and their adequate measurement is important for assessing health outcomes. Many different metrics to summarise 24/7 movement behaviours are used; however, little attention has been paid to visualising these metrics. Data visualisation is likely to impact the way results are communicated and understood by different audiences. This study systematically reviews 24/7 movement behaviour metrics, presents an overview of their visualisations, and develops a framework to guide context-specific visualisation choices.<h4>Methods</h4>An umbrella review was conducted in February 2025 in Scopus and Web of Science. Included papers were reviews of any type, with any human population and study design, having at least one of the three 24/7 movement behaviours as exposure or outcome measured through accelerometers, and clearly reporting the outcome metrics. Data extraction and an adapted thematic data analysis were performed in April 2025. The overview of the visualisations used for the metrics identified in the review and thematic analysis was created through non-systematic web searches and use of Microsoft Copilot. Finally, a framework was created based on the sender-receiver model for effective communication.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 93 reviews were included, with a total of 5667 articles reporting on 134 unique output metrics based on accelerometer data. The most common metrics were step counts and time spent in Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA). The non-systematic web searches showed that most researchers use bar charts, line graphs, or pie graphs to visualise 24/7 movement behaviour data, while Copilot input provided more options of visualisations. The resulting framework was the product of an iterative process aggregating the previous results, providing clear guidance for organising metrics and their corresponding visualisations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study structures and summarises types of visualisations of accelerometer-derived metrics to describe 24/7 human movement behaviour data. Future research is needed to apply the framework in practical contexts and investigate how the visualisations are perceived by different audiences.",Marchiori M; Heidler J; Segantin G; Eckmann HR; Chinapaw MJM; Kjærgaard M; Schipperijn J,"Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics, Faculty of Health, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark. mmarchiori@health.sdu.dk.","Journal of activity, sedentary and sleep behaviors",2025-11-18,10.1186/s44167-025-00088-6,5.9,"visual(kw,title,abstract); data(title,abstract)",Sleep; Communication; Physical Activity; Sedentary Behavior; Wearables; 24/7 Movement Behaviours; Visualisation Methods

To address this clinical gap, we developed NeuropathAI, an interpretable deep learning-based multiclass classification system for rapid, automated diagnosis and differentiation of 88 patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and human immunodeficiency virus-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN).<h4>Methods</h4>A deep learning-based multiclass system was developed to analyze corneal nerve images. These images were preprocessed to train and validate the proposed model and the diagnostic utility was evaluated from the accuracy, F1-score and area under the curve to derive sensitivity, specificity and precision.<h4>Results</h4>NeuropathAI achieved excellent results: AUC-96.75%, sensitivity-83.87%, specificity-95.07%, and demonstrated excellent discrimination for CIDP, CIPN, HIV-SN and DPN with one-vs-all AUC scores of 97%, 93.1%, 99.7% and 96.9%, respectively. Explainability visualization through heatmaps demonstrated that regions of decision making by the model localized to areas with nerve fiber loss, enhancing interpretability.<h4>Interpretation</h4>NeuropathAI achieved rapid and accurate diagnosis of four of the most prevalent peripheral neuropathies globally, underscoring the potential of artificial intelligence-driven corneal image analysis for the rapid diagnosis and differentiation of peripheral neuropathies.",Rabah CB; Petropoulos IN; Stettner M; Ferdousi M; Alam U; Efron N; Serag A; Malik RA,"AI Innovation Lab, Weill Cornell Medicine, Doha, Qatar.",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,2025-11-22,10.1002/acn3.70255,5.5,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract)",Artificial intelligence; disease diagnosis; Peripheral Neuropathy; Corneal Confocal Microscopy; Corneal Nerve
41264910,Digital Survey-Based Tracing of COVID-19 Over the Early Pandemic: Comprehensive Geospatial and Symptomatic Analysis in Lebanon.,"<h4>Background</h4>In response to the early spread of COVID-19 in Lebanon, the University of Balamand developed the HAYATI app, a community-focused, geographic information system (GIS)-based digital health platform aimed at enhancing public health surveillance. At the time, while the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health utilized centralized dashboards to report confirmed cases and monitor national trends, no interactive tool existed to engage the public directly in real-time risk assessment and surveillance, especially in underserved regions.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of the HAYATI app as a GIS-integrated digital surveillance tool to identify high-risk individuals and support targeted testing and contact tracing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon.<h4>Methods</h4>The HAYATI app was launched in March 2020 using ArcGIS Survey123 and real-time dashboards, incorporating a risk scoring algorithm based on 21 clinical and behavioral criteria. Between April 2020 and March 2021, self-reported data were collected from 10,235 individuals across Lebanon. Participants identified as high or major risk through the automated scoring algorithm were referred for free polymerase chain reaction testing at the University of Balamand. Test results were securely communicated to local municipalities and the Ministry of Public Health. Data were analyzed for associations between symptoms and positivity rates, as well as geographic and demographic trends using spatial analysis tools.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 10,235 individuals who submitted data, 1782 were classified as high or major risk and referred for polymerase chain reaction testing. Among them, 394 (22.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Loss of smell and taste was strongly associated with positive test results (P<.001). The highest positivity rates were observed among individuals aged 18-29 years and in the North Governorate. GIS mapping enabled real-time visualization of case clusters, which informed localized containment responses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The HAYATI app effectively filled a critical surveillance gap during the early pandemic phase in Lebanon. By integrating GIS technology, automated risk stratification, and community-level engagement, it provided a scalable model for public health surveillance in resource-limited settings. This approach has potential for broader applications in managing future outbreaks and endemic diseases through decentralized, real-time digital health strategies.",Bassim Y; Abdelrahman A; Iaaly A; Douglas GM; Daou P; Finianos M; Hassan R; Nassif I; Greige L; Dib L; Mardirossian JM; El Chaar M,"Faculty of Medicine, University of Balamand, Koura, Lebanon.",JMIR public health and surveillance,2025-11-20,10.2196/80331,4.5,visualization(abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),GIS; Geographic information system; Surveillance; Risk stratification; Lebanon; Community Engagement; Digital Health; Covid-19
41266254,Digital Biopsy and Network Analysis of Dynamic [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 Data in Patients with Malignant and Benign Pancreatic Lesions.,"The pathologies pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, inflammatory lesions of the pancreas, postpancreatectomy reactive tissue, and recurrent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas all express fibroblast activation protein and are hardly distinguishable by static PET using [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPIs) combined with CT. Dynamic imaging allows full [<sup>68</sup>Ga]-Ga-FAPI kinetic profile analysis, highlighting differences among these pathologies. Here, we applied a voxel-level digital biopsy approach combined with network analysis and clustering to characterize healthy, nonmalignant pathologic, and malignant pathologic kinetic signatures. <b>Methods:</b> This monocentric, retrospective study included 47 patients (>18 y) with morphologically unclear pancreatic lesions on CT or MRI and supplemental [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT in a primary (31 patients) or recurrent (16 patients) setting. Lesions were classified according to biopsy results (primary cases) or CT appearance and clinical course (recurrent cases). Digital biopsy samples (300 voxels) of pancreatic lesions and control organs (muscle, fat, kidneys, liver, and blood) were taken and then masked and imported into an open source visual analytics application. Voxel networks were created with multiple digital biopsy samples from a single scan or digital biopsy samples combined from multiple scans, with a minimum Pearson correlation value of 0.7. A <i>k</i>-nearest-neighbor edge reduction was applied before Markov clustering. Datasets were then unmasked for interpretation. Static PET parameters (SUV<sub>max</sub> and SUV<sub>mean</sub>) and time to peak of pancreatic lesions and control tissues were extracted from isotropic volumes and analyzed by a <i>t</i> test (threshold for significance, <i>P</i> = 0.05). <b>Results:</b> This work created 47 individual networks and 2 combined networks. Within individual networks, voxels tended to arrange and cluster within the sampled volume of interest (VOI; left and right kidneys strongly coclustered). Networks typically arranged into healthy controls, elimination organs, and pathologic (malignant and nonmalignant) regions. Pathologies tended to cluster with high purity (>95% from the same VOI), with multiple clusters per VOI, indicating intralesional heterogeneity. Our analysis approach could differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant pathologies in the primary and recurrence settings. This differentiation was driven by slower FAPI clearance within malignant voxels. <b>Conclusion:</b> The kinetics of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 across the different tissues, coupled with this sampling and analysis approach, allowed the separation and identification of healthy, nonmalignant pathologic, and malignant pathologic clusters and kinetic features that may facilitate diagnosis and warrant further investigation.",Röhrich M; Glatting FM; Geisinger M; Spektor AM; Buchholz HG; Wessendorf J; von Goetze I; Hoppner J; Liermann J; Knoll M; Lang M; Heger U; Schreckenberger M; Loos M; Tavares A; Herfarth K; Debus J; Haberkorn U; Macaskill MG,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Mainz, Mainz, Germany.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",2025-11-20,10.2967/jnumed.125.270185,4.3,"visual analytics(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",Clustering; Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma; Dynamic Pet; [68Ga]ga-fapi
41267163,Bioorthogonal click chemistry to visualize an immunogenic HLA-A2-restricted hepatitis B virus epitope in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.,"Peptide-based therapeutic vaccines exploit cross-presentation by dendritic cells for the induction of effective T cell responses. Their clinical success, however, has been limited due to incomplete understanding of antigen processing and presentation (APP). Bioorthogonal chemistry (BOC) uses chemical ""click"" reactions that can be performed selectively without interference of the cellular environment. A ""click handle"" can be incorporated into a biomolecule with only minor effects on its characteristics, allowing selective visualization and tracking of the biomolecule. We generated 10 analogues of the HLA-A2-restricted, immunogenic hepatitis B virus-derived epitope HBcAg18-27 by replacing each amino acid with the click handle homopropargylglycine. Each analogue was tested for (1) peptide binding affinity to HLA-A2, (2) preservation of immunogenicity, and (3) accessibility for on-cell click reactions. Lastly, we performed a proof-of-concept experiment in which we demonstrate the feasibility of BOC for APP studies. All amino acids could be modified with the click handle without loss of HLA binding. Furthermore, 7 out of 10 analogues retained cognate T cell recognition. Two of the most promising analogues were tested and demonstrated to be accessible for on-cell click as well as suitable for long peptide processing and presentation studies. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the feasibility of BOC to study APP in the human setting. With BOC techniques, we may now be able to sensitively follow antigen routing by visualizing the intracellular location of (long) peptides.

41268963,Increasing Physical Activity via Provider Support and Engagement Using a Digital Health Platform in Adults With Multiple Sclerosis: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>The benefits of physical activity are well established in people with multiple sclerosis (MS); yet, most people with MS are insufficiently active. Although many apps and devices are available to promote physical activity, these are not connected to electronic health records (EHRs), making it difficult for health care providers to prescribe and monitor their patients' physical activity. The ExerciseRx platform is an innovative cloud-based, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant software platform (app+provider dashboard) that was developed to bridge the gap between consumer activity tracking devices, such as personal smartphones, and the EHR. The ExerciseRx app tracks a patient's physical activity using their existing personal smartphone and provides a personalized graded progression in step count goals to increase step count gradually and safely over time. The ExerciseRx app also translates the activity data into actionable metrics on a provider dashboard within the EHR that the provider can use to make activity recommendations and monitor patients' progress; they can also support patients by providing semiautomated weekly feedback and encouragement in meeting physical activity goals.<h4>Objective</h4>This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial designed to understand whether the ExerciseRx digital health platform improves physical activity, symptoms, and functioning in adults with MS relative to a waitlist, usual care control.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants are ambulatory adults with MS (n=106) who engage in <150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intense physical activity. Enrolled participants are assigned to use the ExerciseRx app for 12 weeks, versus a waitlist, usual care control. Participants allocated to the intervention condition have access to the ExerciseRx app, and their providers have access to the participants' activity data via a provider dashboard, connected to the EHR. Participants allocated to usual care receive the care they would normally obtain at the MS Center, including encouragement to participate in and increase physical activity as tolerated from their clinical provider and a handout that describes the current physical activity recommendations for adults with MS and links to local and web-based resources suitable for MS. The primary outcome is the change in average daily step count throughout the 12-week intervention. Secondary outcomes include symptoms (fatigue intensity, pain intensity, sleep, and depressive symptoms), patient-reported functional outcomes (physical functioning, fatigue interference, pain interference, falls, and social participation), and qualitative analysis of participant and provider interviews on usability and acceptability of the ExerciseRx platform.<h4>Results</h4>The study was funded in October 2023. Participant enrollment began in March 2024 and will continue through December 2025. As of July 25, 2025, a total of 85 participants have been enrolled in the trial. Data analysis and dissemination preparations will begin in January 2026.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results of this trial will provide important new information on the efficacy of an innovative digital health intervention tool for physical activity promotion.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06270641; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06270641.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/72213.",Ehde DM; Simmons SB; Alschuler KN; Herring TE; Humbert AT; Robles SR; Ioseliani O; Landis K; Kavanagh LB; Lin CY,"Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.",JMIR research protocols,2025-11-21,10.2196/72213,3.5,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract); electronic health record(abstract),Exercise; Multiple sclerosis; Physical Activity; Clinical Trial; Step Count; Digital Health; Mobile App

However, there are few user-friendly, flexible, and standardized tools for evaluating MR images for quantitative imaging analysis. Here, we develop AutoGlom, an open-source, modular, and expandable imaging software tool that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) for segmentation, analysis, and visualization of 3D MR images of the kidney. This initial version of AutoGlom focuses on morphological segmentation and quantification. We describe kidney segmentation from MR images, followed by the use of the graphical user interface of AutoGlom. Using AutoGlom, we measure glomerular number and volume from ex vivo cationic ferritin-enhanced MRI (CFE-MRI) in mice. We further demonstrate a 3D-printed holder to allow for simultaneous imaging of up to 16 mouse kidneys at high resolution (50 µ<i>m</i>) within several hours. The streamlined workflow facilitates rapid image analysis and accelerates optimization of cationic ferritin dosing and imaging parameters. These tools are a resource for the kidney community that may accelerate the identification of candidate imaging biomarkers from 3D MRI of the kidney and have the potential to be extended to in vivo studies and other imaging modalities.",Li T; Cochran A; Xu Y; Charlton JR; Bennett KM; Timberline SM; Dailey RK; Jannath SY; Baldelomar EJ; Hoch MR; Wu T,"School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University, Tempe 85281, Arizona, USA.",American journal of physiology.

41266696,DCS-NET: a multi-task model for uterine ROI detection and automatic staging of early endometrial cancer in MRI.,"Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy, with a steadily increasing incidence worldwide. Abnormal vaginal bleeding, a hallmark symptom, enables early diagnosis, which is critical for improving clinical outcomes. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) serves as the primary imaging modality for EC evaluation, offering detailed visualization of endometrial and myometrial invasion.This study proposes DCS-Net, a multi-task deep learning framework for the automated detection and staging of early-stage EC in MRI. The framework incorporates an advanced object detection module to accurately localize and crop the uterine region, followed by a convolutional neural network for staging classification.Experimental results show that the detection module achieves high localization performance, and the classification network reaches an accuracy of 90.8%. The region-focused approach improves staging accuracy by 5% compared to direct classification using unprocessed images.These results underscore the potential of DCS-Net to improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in alignment with clinical workflows.

41259710,Usability Evaluation of a Mixed Reality Platform in Pediatric Interventional Cardiology by Specialist Physicians: Mixed Methods Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Immersive technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality are used in pediatric interventional cardiology (IC) to improve anatomical visualization and spatial understanding and support procedural precision. These technologies offer 3D representations of complex cardiac structures, which can aid in preprocedural planning, intraoperative navigation, and team communication. As these technologies gain traction in IC, understanding how medical specialists perceive their value is vital.<h4>Objective</h4>This study assesses what IC specialist physicians consider valuable in immersive technologies by evaluating their experiences with CardioVision, a software designed for pediatric IC procedures.<h4>Methods</h4>A mixed methods design was used, combining questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Purposeful and snowball sampling was used to recruit specialist physicians with experience in IC. The recruited specialist physicians were asked to submit IC cases for software testing. These were uploaded to CardioVision by the developer, who also conducted the testing in person with the physicians at their designated clinical stations. A total of eight specialist physicians completed a pretest questionnaire, used the software, and thereafter completed a posttest questionnaire, which included System Usability Scale and Likert-scale questions on experience with the software. The interviews explored the specialist physicians' experience with the software's performance. Of the 8 participants, 6 further participated in the interviews. The interviews were conducted by two2 of the authors. The qualitative data were analyzed using inductive content analysis, involving subjective interpretation of textual material from the interviews. Following the approach outlined by Elo and Kyngäs, the process comprised three phases: preparation, organization, and reporting. In the preparation and organization phases, one author organized and categorized the interview data in an Excel sheet. The two2 authors then reviewed the material, compared emerging codes and themes, and reached consensus on the final main theme and subthemes for reporting.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 8 questionnaires and 6 interviews were obtained from specialist physicians from Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. Quantitative data from mean System Usability Scale scores showed that users felt confident using the system (mean 4.25). When using the software, the highest positive feedback was for visualization of structures, where all users (8/8, 100%) agreed. Overall, most participants (6/8, 75%) rated the system positively for decision-making support and 5/8 (63%) for complex case preparation. One participant (1/8, 12%) disagreed with its effectiveness in preparing complex cases, indicating mixed opinions in this area. In the interviews, emerging themes aligned with quantitative data to show that participants valued the software's ease of use, high-quality visualization, and decision-making support. Additional benefits included use in medical education, interprofessional collaboration, and patient communication. Developer-clinician collaboration was emphasized as vital for effective integration into routine practice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Immersive technologies offer clinical value when aligned with user needs and integrated through collaborative development.",Chilanga CC; Jahnen A; Hafskjold L,"Center for Health and Technology, University of South-Eastern Norway, Grønland 58, Drammen, 3045, Norway, +47 31 00 90 83.",JMIR formative research,2025-11-19,10.2196/79278,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Congenital heart disease; Pediatrics; Cardiology; interventional radiology; Mixed Reality
41259173,Explainable End-to-End Seizure Prediction via Stationary Wavelet Transform-Driven Dynamic Multiscale Fuzzy Clustering.,"Epileptic seizure prediction holds critical clinical significance for enhancing the quality of life in patients. Despite technological advances, existing approaches face persistent challenges arising from inter-subject variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics and the complex spatiotemporal coupling associated with ictal transitions. These issues compromise both feature discriminability and model explainability. To address these dual limitations, we propose a novel stationary wavelet transform (SWT)-driven dynamic multiscale fuzzy clustering (SD-MFC) framework, an explainable prediction pipeline that integrates EEG signal analysis with transparent clinical decision-making. Methodologically, the spectral-temporal decomposition of EEG signals via SWT is combined with a geometric attention mechanism to model cross-channel dependencies. To capture the dynamic nature of EEG signals, we develop a Riemannian manifold-based fuzzy clustering algorithm through covariance matrix optimization and time-variant manifold metrics. Hierarchical feature fusion is achieved through multiscale convolutional kernels within a three-layer convolutional network. Model training incorporates contrastive learning with a hybrid supervised/self-supervised strategy to enhance robustness. Notably, two explainability methods: a joint feature visualization strategy and an efficient feature ablation study, are proposed to bridge the adaptation gap between the ""black-box"" nature of deep learning models and the requirements of clinical diagnostic. Experimental results on both intracranial and extracranial datasets demonstrate that SD-MFC framework not only exhibits superior predictive performance but also maintains a low FPR, offering a feasible scheme for clinical application of EEG-based seizure prediction.

Over 1,100 SARS-CoV-2 antibody structures have been resolved, marking the largest structural biology effort for a single pathogen. We present a comprehensive analysis of this landmark dataset to investigate the principles of antibody recognition and immune escape. Human immunoglobulins and camelid single-chain antibodies dominate, collectively mapping 99% of the receptor-binding domain. Despite remarkable sequence and conformational diversity, antibodies exhibit convergence in their paratope structures, revealing evolutionary constraints in epitope selection. Analyses reveal near-universal immune escape of antibodies, including all clinical monoclonals, by advanced variants such as KP3.1.1. On average, over one-third of antibody epitope residues are mutated. These findings support pervasive immune escape, underscoring the need to effectively leverage multi-epitope-targeting strategies to achieve durable immunity. To support community accessibility, we developed an interactive web server for visualization and analysis of antibody-antigen complexes and mutational data.",Feng Z; Sang Z; Xiang Y; Escalera A; Weshler A; Schneidman-Duhovny D; García-Sastre A; Shi Y,"Center of Protein Engineering and Therapeutics, Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.",Cell systems,2025-11-21,10.1016/j.cels.2025.101452,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Antibodies; Structure; Epitopes; Immune escape; Virus neutralization; Nanobodies; Structure Biology; Sars-cov-2; Mutational Escape; Clinical Sars-cov-2 Antibodies

PRECOG (https://precog.stanford.edu) is a compendium of datasets with gene expression and clinical outcomes that facilitates visualization of associations between genomic profiles and patient survival. Here, we augment the existing PRECOG with over 10 000 new patients in previously poorly represented adult cancer types, as well as adding annotated pediatric and immunotherapy treated cohorts. Pediatric PRECOG comprises over 3000 patients across 12 cancers; while the checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) PRECOG contains over 4000 patients across 20 cancer subtypes from 80 distinct datasets across 51 studies. Together this represents a doubling in the size of the PRECOG database. We compute and visualize associations of gene expression with survival outcomes using Cox regression for time-to-event, or logistic regression for responder versus nonresponder, across all datasets. We also estimate cell type fractions in samples via computational deconvolution using CIBERSORTx, to identify survival associations at the level of cell types. All expression data, clinical annotations, and gene and cell type survival z-scores and meta-z scores for adult, pediatric, and ICI PRECOG, are available for interactive analysis and download, along with Kaplan-Meier and boxplot visualizations.

41273919,Defining window settings for abdominopelvic photon-counting CT virtual monoenergetic imaging: quantitative and qualitative evaluation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) at 60 keV are recommended for contrast-enhanced soft tissue imaging with decreased radiation dose on clinical photon-counting CT (PCCT). However, 60 keV VMIs appear brighter with default windowing compared to standard 120-kV CT, necessitating manual window adjustments.<h4>Objective</h4>To determine optimal soft tissue and liver window settings for PCCT abdominopelvic imaging at 60 and 70 keV, and to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate default versus optimal windowing.<h4>Methods</h4>With IRB approval, retrospective analysis was performed on dual-phase abdominopelvic PCCT 60 and 70 keV VMIs from 39 patients. Three radiologists manually adjusted center/width (C/W) settings for optimal soft tissue and liver visualization. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was quantified for each phase and keV level, and display-CNR (dCNR) was quantified across multiple windows: PACS default and optimal windows for soft tissue and liver, and vendor-recommended soft tissue windowing. Readers ranked datasets viewed in different windows from most to least preferred and assigned an overall impression (optimal, acceptable, or poor). Expected ranking and impression scores were analyzed, with p-values < 0.05 indicating statistical significance.<h4>Results</h4>Mean CNR increased by 24-27 % (p < 0.001) on 60 keV compared to 70 keV images. With default soft tissue windowing, dCNR at 60 keV decreased by 7 % (arterial) and increased by 19 % (venous) compared to 70 keV but increased by 51 % (arterial) and 27 % (venous) with optimal windowing. Liver dCNR decreased by 10-14 % at 60 keV using default windowing but increased by 75-92 % with optimal windowing on both phases. 60 keV images viewed at optimal windowing scored significantly better in terms of both ranking and impression compared to the default windowing for both soft tissue and liver evaluation on both phases (p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Optimized window settings significantly enhance soft tissue and liver visualization on PCCT VMIs, particularly at 60 keV.",Ren L; Ahn RW; Vasan V; Duan X; Imphean D; Xi Y; Goel A; Zhang Y; Nair V; Xu G; Ananthakrishnan L,"Department of Radiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.

41274410,Preliminary experience with VITOM 3D exoscope during microsurgical treatment of cerebral aneurysms.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>The use of a digital three-dimensional (3D) exoscope system in neurosurgery is increasing as an alternative to the operative microscope due to its similar visual fidelity but superior ergonomics. However, publications on cerebral aneurysms treated with this are scarce.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical information, surgical records and, imaging of patients with cerebral aneurysms undergoing surgery by a single surgeon, from December 2023 to March 2025, using the VITOM 3D as a vision/magnification method exclusively, is analyzed. Postoperative follow-up included angio CT scan. Descriptive statistics and data relating to operative time and complications were analyzed. An extensive discussion regarding other authors´ experience using 4K 3D exoscopes in microsurgical clipping of cerebral aneurysms was performed and compared with the present series.<h4>Results</h4>88 patients with 107 cerebral aneurysms underwent surgery. Most patients were female (65.9%), with a mean age of 52.6 (±13.6) years. Grades I-III WFNS score was seen in 74 (84.1%) patients, with 14 (15.9%) having grade IV. Ruptured aneurysm rate was 94.3%, but up to 14.9% associated unruptured aneurysms were recorded. Complications rate was 9.1%. A favorable outcome was observed in 83.0% of patients based on modified Rankin Scale score at 30 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>VITOM 3D exoscope is a valid alternative to the surgical microscope, since it offers comparable visualization but superior ergonomics, at a lower cost.

41251160,SVAtlas: a comprehensive single extracellular vesicle omics resource.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale particles released by cells, carrying proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites. These vesicles mediate intercellular communication and modulate disease progression across various conditions. Owing to their molecular heterogeneity and the stable bilayer protecting their cargo, EVs serve as valuable tools for early disease detection and personalized therapies. However, traditional bulk EV studies aggregate data, which can mask the distinct molecular profiles of individual EVs critical for targeted diagnostics and treatments, diminishing diagnostic precision. Recent advances in single-EV analysis, leveraging high-resolution sequencing and imaging technologies, have revealed unique molecular signatures. However, a comprehensive database integrating multi-omics data from single EVs remains lacking. To address this, we developed SVAtlas, the first database dedicated to integrating single-EV datasets (2015-2025). SVAtlas incorporates 8120 protein entries, 106 RNA entries (miRNA, mRNA, circRNA, and lncRNA), 2 DNA entries, and 8 lipid/metabolite entries across 276 EV projects, spanning 31 diseases, 32 tissues/organs, and 10 biofluids from five species. SVAtlas offers single-EV datasets with experimental parameters, heterogeneity analyses, disease-specific marker exploration, built-in analysis/clustering/visualization pipelines, and an LLM-based question-answering tool, empowering researchers to explore single-EV omics in detail.

41254439,Structure-based discovery and molecular dynamics evaluation of dihydrorobinetin as a potential anti-osteoclastogenic RANKL inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that destroys joints, and in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed the significant role of osteoclasts in bone degradation associated with this disease. The receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) is associated with osteoclast differentiation and bone degradation in RA. The present study investigated the inhibitory effects of phytocompounds against RANKL. Virtual screening of 10,100 phytochemicals retrieved from the IMPPAT database was performed using AutoDock Vina to identify the top 10 compounds with the best binding scores. The top ten compounds were filtered using the ADME property to identify the most promising lead compound. The lead compound was furthermore analyzed using a 1-µs molecular dynamics simulation with GROMACS to understand the stability of the complex in the system. MM-PBSA was employed for binding energy calculations, and additional post-simulation analyses, including principal component analysis, free energy landscape plotting, and VMD visualization, were performed. Dihydrorobinetin was the most promising inhibitor of the RANKL protein after filtration via ADMET analysis, with a strong binding affinity of - 8.8 kcal/mol, forming four hydrogen bonds. The 1-µs simulation revealed stable binding of dihydrorobinetin with RANKL, and the binding energy calculations performed via the MM-PBSA method showed favorable binding and stability of the complex. This study provides interesting insights into the therapeutic potential of dihydrorobinetin by inducing conformational changes in RANKL to treat bone destruction in RA, laying the groundwork for further experimental validation to confirm its efficacy and clinical potential.",S DSN; Sundararajan V,"Integrative Multiomics Lab, Department of Bio Sciences, School of Bio Sciences and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.",Journal of biological physics,2025-11-19,10.1007/s10867-025-09694-6,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Molecular dynamics simulation; RA; Rankl; Free Energy Landscape; Structure-based Virtual Screening; Dihydrorobinetin
41274113,Augmentation-based deep learning for identification of circulating tumor cells.,"Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are crucial biomarkers in liquid biopsy, offering a noninvasive tool for cancer patient management. However, their identification remains particularly challenging due to their limited number and heterogeneity. Labeling samples for contrast limits the generalization of fluorescence-based methods across different hospital datasets. Analyzing single-cell images enables detailed assessment of cell morphology, subcellular structures, and phenotypic variations, often hidden in clustered images. Developing a method based on bright-field single-cell analysis could overcome these limitations. CTCs can be isolated using an unbiased workflow combining Parsortix® technology, which selects cells based on size and deformability, with DEPArray™ technology, enabling precise visualization and selection of single cells. Traditionally, DEPArray-acquired digital images are manually analyzed, making the process time-consuming and prone to variability. In this study, we present a Deep Learning-based (DL) classification pipeline designed to distinguish CTCs from leukocytes in blood samples, aimed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize clinical workflows. Our approach employs images from the bright-field channel acquired through DEPArray technology leveraging a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network. To improve model generalization, we applied three types of data augmentation techniques and incorporated fluorescence (DAPI) channel images into the training phase, allowing the network to learn additional CTC-specific features. Notably, only bright-field images have been used for testing, ensuring the model's ability to identify CTCs without relying on fluorescence markers. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.798, demonstrating its capability to distinguish CTCs from leukocytes. These findings highlight the potential of DL in refining CTC analysis and advancing liquid biopsy applications.",Russo M; Bertolini G; Cappelletti V; De Marco C; Di Cosimo S; Paiè P; Brancati N,"Institute for High Performance Computing and Networking-National Research Council of Italy (ICAR-CNR), Naples, Italy.",Computers in biology and medicine,2025-11-21,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.111333,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Cancer; Metastases; Augmentation; Circulating Tumor Cells; Deep Learning; Deparray
41247580,Rising or receding? a decade of bibliometric and altmetric trends in gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy research (2014-2024).,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) techniques have become increasingly popular due to their favorable safety profiles compared to traditional glaucoma procedures. Among these, gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) has gained prominence in recent years. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive bibliometric and altmetric analysis of GATT-related literature published between 2014 and 2024, with comparisons to other major MIGS techniques.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection database for publications dated between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2024, despite the data retrieval being performed on May 18, 2025. Boolean search strategies were applied to identify publications related to five MIGS procedures. VOSviewer software (version 1.6.20) was used for network visualization analyses. Citation counts and Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) were compared between GATT and other MIGS groups.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1,123 publications were identified, including 149 related to GATT. GATT demonstrated a sharp increase in publication volume after 2018, peaking in 2024. The mean total citation count for GATT publications was 14.75 ± 35.1, and the mean AAS was 2.01 ± 6.05. Although GATT had a significantly lower AAS compared to Hydrus (8.57 ± 20.4, p = 0.008) and iStent (5.89 ± 16.9, p = 0.002), its total citation count was not statistically significantly different from other MIGS techniques (p = 0.06). The top-cited GATT-specific publication was Grover's 2014 technique report (254 citations; Journal Impact Factor [JIF]: 13.2; Journal Citation Indicator [JCI]: 5.16), while the highest overall citation belonged to Richter's 2016 review on MIGS (276 citations; AAS: 65). Bibliometric mapping revealed that GATT-related keywords were centrally located and highly interconnected. Authors such as Davinder Grover and Zeynep Aktas were among the most influential contributors in the GATT literature.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GATT has emerged as a widely discussed and increasingly studied MIGS technique in the academic literature over the past decade.

Exclusive hysteroscopic treatment has been reported rarely but with good results. To understand the role, the safety, and effectiveness of this approach, we performed a systematic review of the literature.<h4>Design</h4>This study is a systematic review. The literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews.<h4>Data sources and methods</h4>We searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases until December 2024, with a combination of keywords: ectopic pregnancy, scar pregnancy, hysteroscopy, and treatment. Case reports of randomized controlled trials, prospective controlled studies, prospective cohort studies, retrospective studies, case series, and case reports were considered eligible.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 265 manuscripts, but at the end of the screening process, we included a total of 8 manuscripts and 158 patients. We have analyzed for each study the age of the patients, pregnancy history, gestational age, presenting symptoms, Transvaginal ultrasound findings, basal beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), the type of hysteroscope used, complications and their management, and time of beta-hCG negativization.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The hysteroscopic method represents a feasible and safe approach to the CSP treatment with good outcomes and reproducible even with high levels of beta-hCG and a gestational sac over the 3 cm. An initial gestational sac visualization with a diagnostic hysteroscope and the successive use of the resectoscope seems to be the most effective and safe method.

41266707,Global knowledge mapping and technological evolution in hemorrhoid therapy: a multi-tool bibliometric analysis.,"Hemorrhoidal disease imposes a significant global healthcare burden. However, comprehensive analyses mapping its research landscape and technological evolution are lacking. This study employed advanced bibliometric techniques to characterize the knowledge structure, collaborative networks, research hotspots, and emerging trends in hemorrhoid therapy over the past two decades. A total of 2764 relevant publications were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Multi-tool bibliometric analysis and scientific visualization were conducted using VOSviewer (v1.6.19), CiteSpace (v6.2.R4), and Bibliometrix (v4.1.3). Analyses included publication trends, country/institutional contributions, author/institutional collaboration networks, journal co-citation analysis, keyword co-occurrence/clustering, thematic evolution, and burst detection. Annual publications showed a steady increase, signifying growing research interest. China and the United States were the dominant contributors. International collaboration networks displayed regional clustering. Core research domains identified through keyword co-occurrence and clustering included Rubber Band Ligation (RBL), hemorrhoidectomy (Milligan-Morgan, Ferguson, stapled), laser therapy, pain management, postoperative complications, and quality of life. Burst detection and thematic evolution mapping highlighted emerging frontiers such as minimally invasive techniques (Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation [DG-HAL], laser hemorrhoidoplasty), day surgery/ambulatory management, evidence-based guidelines, and long-term outcomes/comparative effectiveness. This first multi-tool bibliometric analysis comprehensively delineates the global research architecture and dynamic evolution of hemorrhoid therapy. It confirms the established role of conventional surgical techniques while identifying a clear shift towards minimally invasive procedures and outpatient management.

41274623,Regenerative effect of Plasma rich in growth factors-transparent membrane in an animal model of photorefractive keratectomy. Comparative study with amniotic membrane.,"This study evaluates the regenerative potential of a newly developed transparent plasma rich in growth factors (tmPRGF) membrane for corneal wound healing, comparing with the amniotic membrane (AM). The wound closure process, corneal opacity, and the expression of key inflammation and tissue regeneration markers were analyzed in a photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) mouse model. The tmPRGF membrane demonstrated superior optical transparency, allowing direct visualization of the corneal surface post-surger, an advantage over AM, which hampers the visualization of the ocular structures. tmPRGF-treated eyes showed significantly faster epithelial wound closure at day 1 post-surgery compared to AM and control groups. By day 7, all groups achieved complete re-epithelialization, but tmPRGF-treated corneas exhibited more mature epithelial morphology and β-catenin expression, indicating better tissue regeneration. Additionally, tmPRGF reduced corneal haze and stromal fibrosis, as evidenced by lower α-SMA-positive myofibroblast presence. Both tmPRGF and AM treatments significantly decreased IL-6-positive immune cells, suggesting anti-inflammatory effects. However, tmPRGF showed a more favorable profile in minimizing inflammation and fibrosis. The findings suggest that tmPRGF not only supports effective corneal healing but also offers clinical advantages such as transparency for real-time monitoring and reduced risk of immune response. These results position tmPRGF as a promising alternative to AM in ocular surface repair.",Anitua E; Muruzabal F; Alcalde I; Merayo-Lloves J; Alkhraisat MH,"Regenerative Medicine Laboratory, Biotechnology Institute (BTI).

41264436,Understanding Aortic Dissection Hemodynamics: Evaluating Adapted Smoke Surfaces Against Streakline-Based Techniques.,"Aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease characterized by blood entering the media layer of the aortic vessel wall. This creates a second flow channel, known as the false lumen, which weakens the aortic wall and can potentially lead to fatal aortic rupture. Current risk stratification of aortic dissections is primarily based on morphological features of the aorta. However, hemodynamics also play a significant role in disease progression, though their investigation and visualization remain challenging. Common flow visualizations often experience visual clutter, especially when dealing with the intricate morphologies of aortic dissections. In this work, we implement and evaluate different approaches to visualizing the flow in aortic dissections effectively. We employ three techniques, namely streaklines with depth-dependent halos, transparent streaklines, and smoke surfaces. The latter is a technique based on streak surfaces, enhanced with opacity modulations, to produce a smoke-like appearance that improves visual clarity. We adapt the original opacity modulation of smoke surfaces to visualize flow even within the complex geometries of aortic dissections, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. To effectively capture dissection hemodynamics, we developed customized seeding structures that adapt to the shape of the surrounding lumen. Our evaluation, conducted via an online questionnaire, included medical professionals, fluid simulation experts, and visualization specialists. By analyzing results across these groups, we highlight differences in preference and interpretability, offering insight into domain-specific needs. No single visualization technique emerged as the best overall. Smoke surfaces provide the best overall clarity and visual realism. However, participants found streaklines with halos to be the best for quantifying flow, dispite them introducing significant visual clutter. Transparent streaklines serve as a middle ground, offering improved clarity over halos while maintaining some level of detail. Across all participant groups, smoke surfaces were rated as the most visually appealing and lifelike, with medical professionals highlighting their resemblance to contrast-agent injections used in clinical practice.",Schroeder A; Ostendorf K; Baumler K; Mastrodicasa D; Fleischmann D; Preim B; Theisel H; Mistelbauer G,,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2025-11-20,10.1109/tvcg.2025.3634823,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41243695,Renal anatomy review activity using 3D digital models and clinical cases.,"Decreased contact hours have led to investigation of new visualization methods for anatomy education. As a result, novel methods of three-dimensional modeling continue to proliferate. Photogrammetry has been utilized recently to construct 3D digital models from human body donors. The purpose of this study was to explore the benefits of photogrammetry and its potential in improving student performance in a first-year preclinical medical renal and genitourinary systems course. All 166 students enrolled in the course were invited to participate in an active learning session that consisted of a pre-test, renal anatomy review lecture, and collaborative time spent reviewing the digital models and clinical cases. Students completed the learning session by taking a post-test. One hundred and forty-seven students participated in the research study, and students scored significantly higher on the post-test (M = 4.54, SD = 1.78) compared to the pre-test (M = 3.58, SD = 1.83), p < 0.001. Students' scores on the post-test accounted for anywhere from 3% to 8% of the variability in performance on the anatomy questions of the bimonthly class exam, overall performance on the bimonthly class exam, and the board exam.

41255088,Antegrade Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Release of Trigger Thumb.,"Trigger finger is a common hand condition, with surgical treatment primarily based on the release of the A1 pulley. While open surgery remains the gold standard, ultrasound-guided percutaneous techniques have demonstrated their advantages due to their minimally invasive nature and their positive impact on recovery. However, in the case of trigger thumb, these techniques present specific challenges, particularly due to the proximity of neurovascular structures and constraints related to instrument orientation. The objective of this paper is to describe a novel axial and antegrade ultrasound-guided percutaneous approach for the release of the A1 pulley in trigger thumb, aiming to enhance procedural accuracy while minimizing iatrogenic risks. This technique is based on an antegrade minimally invasive release with an axial orientation under real-time ultrasound guidance, without reliance on theoretical bony landmarks. This approach enables optimized visualization of anatomical structures and precise control of the instrument's trajectory. It could serve as an additional alternative to existing strategies for the treatment of trigger thumb. The axial and antegrade ultrasound-guided percutaneous approach appears to be a promising technique for trigger thumb release. Further studies are required to evaluate its clinical efficacy, feasibility, postoperative recovery, and safety on a larger scale.",Rousié M; Diaby S; Vandenbulcke V; Apard T,"Epicura Hospital, Baudour.",Techniques in hand & upper extremity surgery,2025-11-19,10.1097/bth.0000000000000541,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Trigger Finger; Ultrasound-guided Surgery; Axial Approach; Antegrade Percutaneous Approach
41243031,Fully Automated Evaluation of Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Strain in Normal Hearts: An Assessment of Accuracy in the Pediatric Population.,"Two-dimensional echocardiography has been shown to be a useful modality for analyzing cardiac deformation parameters. However, the clinical utility of strain analysis is limited by time and training required for manual border tracing. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a ""hands-off,"" measurement program, Philips AutoStrain, for measurements of left-ventricular deformation in children. We hypothesize that AutoStrain may accurately calculate deformation measurements, but its performance may be limited in certain patient populations. Echocardiographic images from 168 patients were analyzed via AutoStrain using fully-automated and semiautomated approaches. GLS were manually traced offline as a reference standard. Autostrain outputs were analyzed for accuracy using percent difference from the reference standard and an accuracy scoring system designed to objectively quantify the precision of Autostrain border tracings at the apex and mitral annuli. Both fully-automated and semiautomated AutoStrain correlated well with manual GLS (Fully-automated R = 0.71, Semiautomated R = 0.90). However, the accuracy of AutoStrain was affected by image axis, patient age, and clear visualization of the LV apex. Fully-automated techniques may lead to a ""hands-off"" future in assessment of LV deformation in older children, but should be used cautiously in younger children until further refinements in the algorithm are performed.",Kauffman H; Convery MJ; Matsubara D; Miller KE; O'Connor MJ; Quartermain MD; Banerjee A,"Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 3401 Civic Center Blvd, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.",Pediatric cardiology,2025-11-17,10.1007/s00246-025-04074-2,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Echocardiography; Strain Imaging; Pediatric Cardiology; Fully Automated Analysis
41272827,Tumor exosomal miR-221-3p induces glycolysis through the LIFR/GLUT1 pathway to destroy the cerebral vascular endothelial cell barrier and promote breast cancer brain metastasis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Tumor-derived exosomal microRNAs mediate intercellular communication between malignant cells and distant organs and play a pivotal role in metastatic dissemination. Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) poses a significant clinical challenge, with endothelial barrier dysfunction representing a critical yet poorly understood step in metastatic progression.<h4>Methods</h4>A physiologically relevant in vitro blood‒brain barrier (BBB) model was established to evaluate exosomal functions. Mechanistic investigations included qPCR and western blotting for miR-221-3p, along with protein expression profiling, immunofluorescence-based tight junction protein visualization, apoptosis detection via annexin V/PI staining, EdU assays for proliferation quantification, and transendothelial migration assessments. To validate the underlying mechanism, ALIX/HRS were silenced to inhibit exosome secretion, and miR-221-3p antagonists were applied. Clinical relevance was assessed by analyzing plasma miR-221-3p levels in breast cancer (BC) patients.<h4>Results</h4>Highly invasive breast cancer-derived exosomal miR-221-3p induced glycolysis and lactic acid accumulation in brain microvascular endothelial cells by targeting the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), leading to endothelial barrier destruction and reduced tight junction protein expression. This significantly enhanced endothelial barrier permeability and tumor cell transendothelial migration capacity. Silencing ALIX/HRS or antagonizing miR-221-3p markedly reversed these effects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings indicate that BC can target LIFR in hCMEC/D3 cells via exosomal miR-221-3p, thereby promoting glycolysis and inhibiting the expression of tight junction proteins, which facilitates tumor metastasis.",Zhu K; Yao H; Hei J; Li S; Ye T; Jiang W; Wang S; Luo Z; Martin T; Zhou J; Zhang S,"Department of Neurosurgery, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.",Journal of translational medicine,2025-11-21,10.1186/s12967-025-07372-8,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Exosome; ZO-1; Occludin; glycolysis; Glut1; Lifr; Mir-221-3p; Bcbm
41268655,"The ""Inferior"" Petrolingual Ligament for Endoscopic Endonasal ""Lateral"" Transpetrosal Approach.","<h4>Objective</h4>Endoscopic endonasal approach to the petrous apex is feasible but presents challenges due to the obstruction posed by the internal carotid artery (ICA). Medial or inferomedial approaches, which involve ICA transposition or contralateral transmaxillary visualization, provide only limited lateral exposure of the apex. This study introduces a novel endoscopic endonasal ""lateral"" transpetrosal approach (EELPA) to the petrous apex.<h4>Methods</h4>Endoscopic endonasal transpterygoid anatomical dissections were performed bilaterally on nine formalin-fixed cadaveric heads. The study focused on the endosurgical identification of the dural layers and ligaments of the middle fossa. The extradural lateral petrosectomy through these dural layers and ligaments was assessed. A representative clinical case illustrates the findings.<h4>Results</h4>A newly identified anatomical structure, termed the ""inferior"" petrolingual ligament (IPLL), was described. This ligament spans from the ventral middle cranial fossa to the ventrolateral aspect of the foramen lacerum, surrounding the inferior part of the lingula. It is located above the junction of the greater superficial petrosal nerve into the Vidian nerve. Transection and detachment of the IPLL provide access to the lateral extradural space of the petrous apex. Following superior and lateral petrosectomy, critical structures such as the tentorium, trigeminal nerve, superior petrosal vein, facial and vestibulocochlear nerves, and abducens nerve can be exposed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study introduces the IPLL as a consistent and reliable anatomical landmark for EELPA. Identifying the IPLL facilitates extradural exposure and resection of the lateral petrous apex while minimizing disruption to the ICA and cranial nerves.",Xie T; Xie Q; Zhang X; Chen P; Liu S; Hu F; Yang LL; Yang H,"Department of Neurosurgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.",Head & neck,2025-11-21,10.1002/hed.70094,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Anatomy; Endoscope; Endonasal; Petrous Apex
41263991,Long wavelength excitation frequency upconversion xanthene probe for fluorescence detection and imaging of cysteine.,"A significant limitation of existing fluorescent probes is their broad reactivity toward multiple biothiols, including cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy), and glutathione (GSH). The structural similarity and overlapping reactivity of these thiol-containing species present a critical challenge for the selective discrimination of individual targets within complex biological environments. To address this limitation, we present M-Cys, a cysteine-selective frequency upconversion luminescence (FUCL) probe engineered from heteroanthracene-based fluorophores. By utilizing anti-Stokes emission, M-Cys enables near-infrared (NIR) excitation at 808 nm while simultaneously emitting NIR light (742 nm), thereby overcoming the limitations associated with conventional Stokes-shifted probes. This innovative design achieves a three-fold enhancement in sensitivity compared to traditional 690-nm excitation, with a detection limit of 23.2 nM, in contrast to 65.9 nM, attributable to reduced background interference and improved signal-to-noise ratios for FUCL. Comprehensive selectivity assays confirm M-Cys's specificity for cysteine over competing biothiols, thereby ensuring reliable biological discrimination. In addition to in vitro experiments, M-Cys significantly enhances high-contrast imaging of exogenous cysteine in live cells and facilitates in vivo FUCL visualization in murine models. This methodology leverages FUCL's deep tissue penetration and minimal phototoxicity. By integrating unprecedented sensitivity with translational applicability, this study establishes a versatile optical platform that advances high-precision probes for clinical diagnostics.",Tang Y; Chen Q; Zeng M; Ma X; Zhu L; Zuo Z; Lan Q; Wu Y,"Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Synthetic Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Materials, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou, 341000, P R China.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2025-11-20,10.1007/s00216-025-06237-9,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cysteine; Bioimaging; Xanthene Dyes; Frequency Upconversion Luminescence
41273994,Engineering a fluorescent probe with symmetric D-π-A-π-D configuration for fluorescence discrimination of HSA from BSA.,"Human serum albumin (HSA) levels serve as critical biomarkers for disease diagnosis, highlighting the need for both continuous monitoring and novel detection methods. Numerous studies have reported that D-π-A structural fluorescent probes can be used for visualization and real-time monitoring of HSA in complex biological environments by detecting characteristic changes in emission color and intensity. However, designing fluorescent probes that can discriminate between HSA and bovine serum albumin (BSA) remains challenging due to their structural similarities. Moreover, visual on-site HSA detection using a smartphone and portable sensing device offers substantial benefits, particularly for point-of-care testing (POCT) in clinical settings. Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance detection specificity, and develop POCT systems. In this study, a symmetrical D-π-A-π-D structured fluorescent probe (designated APA) with low background fluorescence was developed for the selective detection and quantification of HSA. APA exhibited a 100-fold fluorescence enhancement in the presence of HSA but only a 5-fold enhancement with BSA, resulting in a selectivity index of 20 for highly discriminative detection of HSA versus BSA. The fluorescence intensity of APA demonstrated a linear relationship with HSA concentration up to 8 μM, with a detection limit of 14.3 nM. The interaction studies confirmed that APA specifically binds to Site III of HSA in a 1:1 M ratio. Given the excellent performance of APA, it was further applied to quantify HSA in serum, assess sample purity and develop a point-of-care testing (POCT) system.

41249539,SAGES 2025 guidelines for fluorescence image-guided gastrointestinal surgery using indocyanine green.,"<h4>Background</h4>Fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) with indocyanine green (ICG) is a surgical adjunct that provides real-time, advanced visualization during surgery. It has been increasingly used in clinical practice for its potential to enhance intraoperative precision and safety. However, evidence to date regarding its utility remains variable. An expert panel was convened to provide evidence-based recommendations on the intraoperative use of FIGS with ICG across several surgical applications to support clinicians and patients in decision-making.<h4>Methodology</h4>A systematic review was carried out, including a literature search up to October 2022, addressing eight key questions regarding FIGS with ICG compared to its absence in various surgical settings and service lines. The findings were subsequently presented to a panel of adult and pediatric surgeons. Subject matter experts then used the GRADE methodology to develop evidence-based recommendations.<h4>Results</h4>Recommendations in favor of using FIGS with ICG were made for detection of non-regional metastases, intraoperative identification of primary cancers, LN identification in GI cancers, and anastomosis quality in esophageal and left-sided colorectal anastomosis. Thoracic duct identification and bariatric and pediatric pull-through anastomosis did not have sufficient evidence to make a formal recommendation. Still, the expert consensus was that FIGS with ICG is a reasonable option for those surgical applications.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These recommendations guide the use of FIGS with ICG in different surgical areas according to the existing literature and expert input. The panel also highlighted evidence gaps to support future research for a stronger evidence base around FIGS in adult and pediatric gastrointestinal surgery.",Calabrese EC; Kumar S; Shehata D; Kapsampelis P; Scholz S; Rodríguez-Luna MR; Narula N; Chiu J; Husain F; Sylla P; Maddern G; Ayloo S; Awad Z; Slater BJ; Keller DS,"Department of Surgery, University of California-East Bay, 1411 E 31st St, Oakland, CA, 94602, USA. eclbrs@gmail.com.",Surgical endoscopy,2025-11-17,10.1007/s00464-025-12356-2,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Guidelines; Indocyanine Green (Icg); Fluorescent Imaging; Fluorescence Image-guided Surgery (Figs); Gastrointestinal (Gi) Surgery
41274325,"Efficacy and Safety of Fetal Magnetocardiography for Detecting Fetal Cardiac Magnetic Signals: A Two-Center, Single-Arm, Prospective Clinical Trial (FAMILY).","<h4>Background</h4>Accurate detection of fetal cardiac time intervals is essential for diagnosing arrhythmias, yet conventional echocardiography cannot record fetal cardiac electrical activity. Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) offers precise, noninvasive detection, but clinical evidence remains limited.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fMCG for detecting fetal cardiac magnetic signals, by comparison with fetal electrocardiography (fECG).<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a two-center, single-arm, prospective trial involving 342 pregnant women aged ≥18 years with gestational ages >18 weeks. Each participant underwent both fECG and fMCG on the same day, with cardiac time intervals recorded. The primary endpoint was the detection rate of fetal cardiac waveforms reflecting atrial and ventricular rhythm relationships.<h4>Results</h4>In the full analysis set (n = 342), fMCG demonstrated a significantly higher detection rate for QRS complexes and RR intervals than fECG (87.98% vs. 78.95%; p < 0.01), with a rate difference of 9.03% (95% CI: 3.50%-14.56%). Similar results were observed in the per-protocol set (n = 340; fMCG: 87.94% vs. fECG: 79.41%; p < 0.01). Notably, only fMCG could reliably detect PR intervals (86.22%), P waves (86.22%), T waves (78.89%), and QT/QTc intervals (78.89%). Adverse events were rare (n = 1, 0.29%) and unrelated to the device.<h4>Conclusions</h4>fMCG was superior to fECG in detecting RR and QRS signals. Moreover, fMCG uniquely enabled visualization of other intervals critical to arrhythmia diagnosis. It also exhibited a favorable safety profile, supporting its potential in fetal cardiac monitoring.",Yu M; Shen M; Zhang S; Wu Y; Wang L; Zhu H; Sun L; Sun K; Chen S,"Department of Pediatric Cardiovascular, Xin Hua Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200092, China.",Heart rhythm,2025-11-20,10.1016/j.hrthm.2025.11.033,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Detection rate; superiority; Cardiac Time Intervals; Fetal Magnetocardiography (Fmcg); Fetal Electrocardiography (Fecg)
41270646,The therapeutic potential of scaffold containing substituted amine derivatives in the drug design of antidepressant compounds.,"Depression is a complex, progressive mental disorder and a major risk factor for suicide. The available therapeutics are highly unmet the clinical demands in terms of safety and efficacy. The presence of the substituted amine structural fragment in numerous pharmaceutical compounds has shown a wide range of biological activities, including those of central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs. Results of different studies showed the presence of substituted amine in many bioactive natural compounds exhibiting potent antidepressant activity. The substituted amine motif-containing derivatives showed the antidepressant action through varied mechanisms that include selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, blocking of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptors (5-HT<sub>7</sub>) antagonist, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibition, etc. Cumulative research from the last few decades showed that these derivatives, having a substituted amine motif, possess antidepressant potential. These reported compounds showed progress in tackling side effects and improving the antidepressant potential of the newly developed compounds. Therefore, it can be postulated that substituted amine might possess a significant role in the design of therapeutic modalities that can act as promising therapeutics in the central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as depression. This review presents the synthetic derivatives containing substituted amine in various scaffolds such as indole, piperidine, piperazines, quinazolines, aryl-sulfonamides, and cinnamamide. Further, we have included the results of the heatmap study for predicting the comparative potency, matrix-based visualization, and metabolic stability from the multiple published studies to support the design of substituted amine-containing compounds. The analysis of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these substituted amine-containing derivatives discussed in the article will further support the progression of safer antidepressants.",George N; Akhtar MJ; Al Balushi K; Al Sabahi B; Khan SA,"College of Pharmacy, National University of Science and Technology, PO-620, PC-130, Azaiba, Bousher, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jaipur National University, Jaipur, Rajasthan, 302017, India.",European journal of medicinal chemistry,2025-11-19,10.1016/j.ejmech.2025.118381,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Natural products; Monoamines; Antidepressant; Heatmap; Substituted Amine
41273922,Superior diagnostic performance of high frame rate Contrast-Enhanced ultrasound (HiFR-CEUS) for small focal liver lesions (≤3 cm): A multicenter study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of high frame rate contrast enhanced ultrasound (HiFR-CEUS) for focal liver lesions (FLLs) of different sizes, particularly for lesions ≤ 3 cm.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this retrospective multicenter study, patients with FLLs confirmed by surgical resection, core needle biopsy or radiologically confirmed between May 2022 and May 2024 were enrolled. Patients underwent conventional CEUS followed by HiFR-CEUS within one week prior to pathological diagnosis. Lesion margins and arterial phase enhancement characterization were assessed using a 5-point scale. Lesions were categorized into three size-based groups: group 1 (≤ 3 cm), group 2 (> 3 cm to ≤ 5 cm), and group 3 (> 5 cm). Diagnostic performance metrics and inter-modality comparisons were conducted.<h4>Results</h4>Among 150 patients (mean age 58.2 years; 63.5 % male), 112 lesions were malignant and 38 lesions were benign. HiFR-CEUS significantly improved the depiction of lesion margin clarity (P < 0.001), enhancement direction and pattern (P < 0.001), and vascular architecture (P = 0.001) compared to conventional CEUS in group 1. The diagnostic confidence score of HiFR-CEUS improved significantly in group 1 (4.2 ± 1.0 vs. 3.7 ± 0.8, P < 0.001). The diagnostic performance of HiFR-CEUS was superior to that of conventional CEUS in group 1, with the AUC increasing from 0.64 to 0.87 (P = 0.0165).<h4>Conclusion</h4>HiFR-CEUS significantly enhances the diagnostic capability for FLLs, especially for small lesions (≤ 3 cm) where conventional CEUS may be limited, by improving visualization of dynamic vascular patterns. These findings support the integration of HiFR-CEUS into clinical practice, particularly for the early and accurate characterization of small nodules in high-risk patients, as recommended in recent WFUMB and CEUS LI-RADS guidelines.",Qiu YJ; Lu XY; Huang YL; Cheng R; Wei L; Clevert DA; Dietrich CF; Wang WP; Dong Y,"Department of Ultrasound, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China.",European journal of radiology,2025-11-17,10.1016/j.ejrad.2025.112527,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Vascular architecture; Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound; Focal Liver Lesions; Diagnostic Performance; Hifr-ceus
41270419,SERS imaging and ICP-MS quantification of the biological uptake of nanoplastics using a dual-detectable model nanomaterial.,"Nanoplastics (NPs) pose significant concerns to human health due to their wide environmental presence and high potential for biological uptake, transport, and accumulation. Conventional analytical methods for studying NP-biota interactions suffer from low accuracy and precision due to limited reliability and quantitative capability. To address these challenges, a dual-detectable NP material was developed that allows for in-situ imaging by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and ex-situ quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Here, a model NP that has a core-shell structure with Raman reporter-functionalized gold nanoparticles as the core and a layer of plastic as the shell was synthesized. The model polystyrene (PS) NPs demonstrated stability in structure, morphology, size, and surface charge over one year, with no indication of constituent leaching because of the covalent bonding of the Raman indicator to the Au core, ensuring stable signals and enabling reliable long-term monitoring in complex biological systems. The model NPs remained stable in suspension over 24 h without observable precipitation. A single model NP was successfully detected by SERS, indicating the single-particle detection capability of this approach. Further, garlic (Allium sativum) was used as a biological model to evaluate the potential of using the dual-mode detectable model NPs to study NP-biota interactions. Garlic roots exposed to PS NPs for 30 days at 2 × 10⁹ and 2 × 10 ¹⁰ particles/mL accumulated average particle counts of 1.9 × 10⁷ and 2.3 × 10⁸ particles per plant, respectively. At the highest tested concentration (2 ×10 ¹¹ particles/mL), uptake increased to 2.4 × 10⁹ particles per plant as quantified in root tissues. These results confirm a concentration-dependent uptake pattern. NP uptake by garlic roots further increased under longer exposure periods. ICP-MS quantification confirmed the presence of model NPs in roots rather than in the upper parts of the plant, as well as the concentration-dependent accumulation. This dual-mode detectable model NPs enable both semi-quantitative NP visualization via SERS imaging and accurate quantification analysis through ICP-MS, serving as a powerful tool for studying the biological uptake, transport, and accumulation of NPs. Their use can significantly improve our understanding of their fate and effects on biota in the future.",Liu M; Das A; Zuverza-Mena N; Musante C; White JC; Wang C; Guo H,"Department of Chemistry, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902, USA; Department of Material Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902, USA.",Journal of hazardous materials,2025-11-17,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.140520,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),SERS; Nanoplastics; Icp-ms Quantification; In-situ Bioimaging
41273341,Posterior two-thirds corpus callosotomy in the semisitting position: Technical advantages and outcomes in drug-resistant epilepsy.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Posterior corpus callosotomy is an established palliative surgical option for patients with drug-resistant generalized epilepsy, especially with drop attacks. Although the posterior approach has been described, the semisitting position remains underutilized and rarely documented in literature. This technique enhances midline visualization, reduces retraction, and allows safer access to posterior interhemispheric structures. Our series illustrates the technical feasibility of this approach, accompanied by operative descriptions and video documentation.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively reviewed 10 patients who underwent posterior two-thirds corpus callosotomy via a right occipital craniotomy in the semisitting position. The surgical corridor enabled direct access to the splenium, Galenic venous system, and pericallosal arteries with only transient use of a fixed retractor. The retractor can be subsequently removed after splenial exposure with sufficient brain relaxation. The clinical and operative outcomes seizure frequency, antiseizure medication changes, hospital disposition, and complications were collected.<h4>Results</h4>Ten patients (mean age = 27 years, epilepsy duration = 22.6 years) underwent the procedure without complications. The median follow-up was 18 (interquartile range [IQR] = 12-28) months. Seven patients experienced drop attacks, and median monthly drop attacks decreased from 36 (IQR = 2.5-70) to 0 (IQR = 0-23) postoperatively. Of those who experienced drop attacks, five of seven achieved complete resolution, and the remaining two achieved a reduction of 66% and 68%. Additionally, nine of 10 patients experienced other seizures besides drop attacks, and these seizures were reduced from 84 (IQR = 72-112) to five (IQR = 1-16) per month. Two patients developed transient disconnection syndrome that resolved spontaneously. No cases of hemodynamic instability or venous air embolism occurred.<h4>Significance</h4>The semisitting posterior callosotomy technique appears to offer favorable anatomical access and gentle tissue handling, with no intraoperative complications in this limited series. Although these preliminary findings are encouraging, further studies should determine its broader applicability and long-term outcomes. This approach may warrant consideration as a surgical option in selected patients with drop attack-dominant epilepsies.",Chen JJ; Darling C; Mallela AN; Gonzalez-Martinez JA,"School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.",Epilepsia,2025-11-22,10.1111/epi.70026,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Epilepsy; Corpus callosum; Drop Attacks; Atonic; Posterior Callosotomy
40550699,"Pituitary Photon-Counting Detector CT for Cushing Disease: Preoperative Lesion Localization, Intraoperative Findings, and Postoperative Outcomes.","<h4>Background and purpose</h4>MRI fails to localize a tumor in up to 40% of cases of adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent Cushing disease (CD), impacting patient outcomes and creating uncertainty in the diagnosis. Photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) is a new CT technology with better imaging performance than conventional CT. PCD-CT is a novel imaging technique for CD, especially for MR-negative cases, however, its application to CD remains unknown.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We present a cohort of consecutive patients with a preoperative PCD-CT undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for CD at a single institution from September 2023 to January 2025. All patients underwent gadolinium-enhanced pituitary MRI for baseline work-up and PCD-CT as part of their preoperative planning imaging. Both imaging modalities were used to localize the lesion and guide surgical planning. The accuracies of MRI and PCD-CT were based on confirmation of the lesion location by a combination of intraoperative visualization, pathologic confirmation, and postoperative biochemical remission, and were compared with each other via Fisher exact test.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-five patients with CD were included in this analysis. The cohort's median age was 50 years old, and 88% were women. At diagnosis, 88% had central obesity, 76% had hypertension, 48% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 20% had osteoporosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI accurately identified 56% of lesions, while it was negative in 24% and misleading in 20%. Dynamic contrast-enhanced PCD-CT was superior in localizing CD (<i>P</i> = .01), accurately identifying 92% of lesions, while it was negative in 4% and misleading in 4% of cases. Early postoperative biochemical remission was achieved in 88% of cases, while 84% remained in remission at follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PCD-CT had a high rate of adenoma localization confirmed intraoperatively, even among MR-negative cases, potentially leading to high remission and gland preservation rates. Its role in the clinical workflow of preoperative evaluation for CD requires further investigation, but current evidence supports its value in lesion localization, especially in MR-negative disease.",Mark IT; Michalopoulos G; Van Gompel J; Celda MP; Bancos I; Donegan D; Gruber L; Erickson D; Nagelschneider A; Yu L,"From the Department of Radiology (I.T.M., A.N., L.Y.), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota Mark.Ian@mayo.edu.",AJNR.

41264790,Factors Shaping Public Perceptions of a Range of Robotic Technologies in Surgery: Cross-Sectional Web-Based Survey.,"<h4>Background</h4>Within the surgical field, there has been an evolution in the application of robotic technology. Fully automatic robotic systems and augmented visualization tools are being introduced and may eventually replace existing surgical extenders such as the da Vinci surgical system. The literature on public perception of robotic surgery is growing, though specific drivers of these attitudes remain under investigation.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study is to investigate the underlying motivators of public perceptions toward robotic surgeries with varying levels of autonomy through a formal technology acceptance model.<h4>Methods</h4>An online survey was distributed via the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Survey participants were provided definitions of a continuum of robotic technologies: robotic surgical extenders (technology without independent actions), semiautonomous robotic surgery (technology that provides guidance to the surgeon and requires surgeon input), and fully autonomous robotic surgery (technology that performs tasks autonomously without direct human interaction). The survey assessed overall attitudes toward each application of robotic technology in surgery and included questions delineating specific receptivity based on (1) perceived usefulness, (2) social risk, (3) time risk, (4) personal risk, and (5) reliability. A technology acceptance model was built to identify associations between these factors and overall attitudes toward robotic and semiautonomous surgeries.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1221 survey responses were recorded (mean age 38, SD 12 y; females: n=635, 52%). Individuals were more willing to accept robotic surgical extenders and semiautonomous robotic surgery compared to autonomous robotic surgery. Higher levels of education and better self-reported health were correlated with more positive attitudes toward autonomous robotic surgery. Perceptions of these technologies were not associated with age, gender, or income. Overall, attitudes toward robotic technologies in surgery were driven by views on the reliability, safety, and efficiency of the procedures. There was less concern regarding time risk and social risk associated with robotic and semirobotic surgeries.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The public is more accepting of semiautonomous surgery and surgical extenders than fully autonomous surgery.

41267162,Prevalence of Toxic Exposures Among Women Veterans With Breast or Gynecologic Cancers Receiving Veterans Affairs (VA) Care.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Toxic exposures have been linked to hormonal disruption and DNA damage, increasing risk for hormone-sensitive cancers, such as breast and gynecologic cancers. However, the effect of toxic exposure on women Veteran cancer risk is unknown, especially for Veterans who served in the recent Middle East conflict because of the latency with which cancer develops. This study assesses the prevalence of toxic exposures among women Veterans with diagnosed breast and gynecologic cancers.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This descriptive, cross-sectional study examines self-reported toxic exposures among Veterans diagnosed with breast or gynecologic cancers in the Veterans Health Administration and who participated in a clinical care survey with a nurse navigator. Data were obtained from Veteran Health Affairs (VA) electronic medical records and data from the Breast and Gynecologic Oncology System of Excellence (BGSoE) Program Dashboard. Exposure categories include air pollutants, occupational hazards, chemicals, physical agents, and biological risks. We compared demographic, health, and geographic factors between Veterans who reported hazardous exposure versus those who did not and described the characteristics of those hazards.<h4>Results</h4>Nearly 50% of women Veterans in the sample reported experiencing a hazardous exposure during military service. Over 80% reported feeling very or somewhat concerned about the exposure. Airborne exposures were the most frequently reported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Women Veterans with breast and/or gynecologic cancer frequently report hazardous exposures during military service, which may impact their actual and perceived cancer risk and subsequent health care utilization. Future research is needed to assess the relationship between perceived/reported and actual hazardous exposures and inform any needed cancer interception.",Shepherd-Banigan M; Cummin GL; Berkowitz TS; Weidenbacher HJ; Moss H; Chawla N; Goldstein KM; Hazra A; Bayley EM; Colonna S; Smith I; Halwani AS; Kelley MJ; Zullig LL,"Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation, Durham VA Health Care System, Durham, NC 27701, United States.",Military medicine,2025-11-20,10.1093/milmed/usaf561,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
41268358,Development of a Conceptual Framework for Smart Hospitals: A Qualitative Study in Iran.,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>The concept of a smart hospital refers to an advanced care model aimed at improving quality of care while using resources efficiently. This study aims to develop a comprehensive conceptual model that clearly defines the key dimensions of smart hospitals.<h4>Methods</h4>This qualitative study was conducted in 2024. The participants included 22 health system managers with a minimum of 5 years of managerial experience, alongside policymakers and scientific experts familiar with the concept of smart hospitals in Iran. Data were collected through targeted semi-structured interviews, followed by snowball sampling until data saturation was reached. The interview questions focused on the concepts and dimensions of smart hospitals. Subsequently, the interviews were transcribed, meaning units were identified, coded, and classified based on similarities and patterns. Themes were then extracted and analyzed using content analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis identified 5 main themes, 21 subthemes, and 94 items. These themes included: Management and Leadership (control, human resource, financial resource, planning, and management dashboard), Care and Treatment (inpatient services, outpatient services, pharmaceutical services, and health promotion), Information and Communication Systems (health files, communication infrastructure, information infrastructure, and network management), Medical Equipment (therapeutic equipment, diagnostic equipment, detection equipment, and rehabilitation equipment), and Structures and Facilities (energy management, risk management, waste management, and smart facilities).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The smart hospital concept is complex, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration and adherence to health standards. Success depends on optimizing resources, strengthening policies and planning, enhancing information systems, upgrading facilities, and prioritizing smart care processes and medical equipment.",Malekzadeh R; Abedi G; Sadeghi M,"Department of Healthcare Services Management, Health Sciences Research Center, Faculty of Health Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences Sari Iran.",Health science reports,2025-11-18,10.1002/hsr2.71339,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Model; Hospital; Smart Hospital; Intelligentization
