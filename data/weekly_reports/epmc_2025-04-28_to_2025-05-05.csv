40306464,Standardizing Multidrug Resistance Definitions and Visualizations to Support Surveillance across One Health.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to understand the current use of visualizations for multidrug resistance (MDR) data across the One Health spectrum and the visualization preferences and definitions of MDR used by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) experts, with emphasis on the animal health sector of One Health, which lacks standardized MDR definitions.<h4>Methods</h4>A rapid scoping review was conducted to synthesize current approaches to visualize multidrug resistance. Six databases and gray literature were searched with antimicrobial, resistance, surveillance, and figure or dashboard terms. An active machine learning model was used for the initial screening of references. An online survey was distributed to self-identified AMR experts, including questions about respondents' country of employment, job position, definitions of MDR, and preferences for MDR metrics and visualizations.<h4>Results</h4>Bar charts, visual antibiograms, heat maps and network graphs were the most common visualizations employed in peer-reviewed publications, websites, and reports. Survey respondents preferred simplistic visualizations, such as line graphs and heat maps. Respondents used a variety of MDR definitions, although resistance to three or more antimicrobial categories was the most common. Some respondents advocated for the exclusion of intrinsic resistance in the definition, while others argued for its inclusion.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite historic proposals for standardizing international definitions of MDR, a lack of consensus remains. Respondents also expressed different preferences for MDR visualizations. Some visualizations currently in use, such as network graphs, are complex and may be challenging to interpret. Harmonization of MDR definitions and optimization of visualizations are essential to facilitate comparisons across populations and studies.",Angel CC; Glowney A; Lin E; Mosaddegh A; Sobkowich K; Poljak Z; Weese JS; Cazer CL,"Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University.",Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2025-04-28,10.1016/j.jgar.2025.04.006,14.5,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(abstract)",Multidrug resistance; Definition; Surveillance; Visualization; Scoping Review
40312600,Trends in the applications of artificial intelligence in fatty liver diseases.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced and shows great potential in the prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of fatty liver disease (FLD). This study aims to summarize AI's applications and emerging trends in FLD to inspire future research directions.<h4>Method</h4>We analyzed 270 articles sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection published between 2006 and 2024. The study focuses on the medical application of AI in FLD, examining the contributions of authors, institutions, countries, keywords, and cited references.<h4>Results</h4>AI is predominantly applied in FLD diagnosis, with progression from simple diagnostic tools to advanced methods for classifying FLD and assessing liver fat content. Moreover, the types of data used in AI development have evolved, incorporating a variety of new image and clinical data sources. AI is also being integrated into drug development and personalized nutritional therapies for FLD. Additionally, researchers are becoming increasingly interested in the application of AI to study FLD genes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We found that the applications of AI in FLD are mainly reflected in the prediction, diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of FLD. In contrast to traditional medicine, AI has the potential to advance the fields of precision medicine and telemedicine, as well as to conserve additional social resources. Moreover, AI may help medical personnel from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, FLD prognosis, and the use of AI to analyze gene prediction and natural language processing (NLP).",Xie TA; Liufu LL; Chen HJ; Chen HL; Hou XT; Wang XR; Han MY; Shan YK; Shen RJ; Wu ZY; Li SJ; Juengpanich S; Topatana W,"Department of General Surgery, Sir Run-Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310016, China. 22218539@zju.edu.cn.",Hepatology international,2025-05-02,10.1007/s12072-025-10827-1,13.1,"visualization(kw); visual(kw); artificial intelligence(kw,title,abstract); data(kw,abstract); informatics(kw)","Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Diagnosis; Fatty liver; computer-assisted; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Medical Informatics Applications; Data Visualization; Precision Medicine; Digital Health; Fatty Liver, Alcoholic"
40299116,Predicting Visual Acuity after Retinal Vein Occlusion Anti-VEGF Treatment: Development and Validation of an Interpretable Machine Learning Model.,"Accurate prediction of post-treatment visual acuity in macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO-ME) is critical for optimizing anti-VEGF therapy and improving clinical outcomes. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise in ophthalmic prognostication, existing models often lack interpretability and clinical applicability for RVO management. This study developed and validated an interpretable ML model to predict visual acuity changes in RVO patients following anti-VEGF treatment. Using retrospective data from 259 RVO patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, we identified key predictive features through the Boruta algorithm and evaluated eight ML algorithms. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model emerged as optimal, achieving an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.96) in the testing cohort with 0.83 accuracy, 0.88 sensitivity, 0.73 specificity, 0.87 F1 score, and 0.14 Brier score. Critical predictors included baseline visual acuity, systolic blood pressure (SBP), age, diabetic retinal inner layer dysfunction (DRIL), and disease subtype. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed baseline visual acuity as the most influential prognostic factor, followed by SBP and age. Our model seeks to bridge the critical gaps in current research: (1) systematically comparing the applicability and effects of different ML algorithms in RVO-ME visual acuity prediction, and (2) inherent interpretability through SHAP value visualization. The combination of high predictive performance (AUC > 0.9) with inherent clinical transparency may enable the practical implementation of this tool in guiding anti-VEGF treatment decisions. Future validation in multicenter cohorts could further strengthen its generalizability for personalized RVO management.",Liang C; Liu L; Zhao T; Ouyang W; Yu G; Lyu J; Zhong J,"Department of Ophthalmology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, 613 Huangpu Road, Guangzhou, 510630, Guangdong Province, China.",Journal of medical systems,2025-04-29,10.1007/s10916-025-02190-3,11.2,"visualization(abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Retinal Vein Occlusion; Anti-vegf; Interpretable Machine Learning; Extreme Gradient Boosting; Visual Acuity Prediction
40308868,Resident clinical dashboards to support precision education in emergency medicine.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>With the move toward competency-based medical education (CBME), data from the electronic health record (EHR) for informed self-improvement may be valuable as a part of programmatic assessment. Personalized dashboards are one way to view these clinical data. The purpose of this concept paper is to summarize the current state of clinical dashboards as they can be utilized by emergency medicine (EM) residency programs.<h4>Methods</h4>The author group consisted of EM physicians from multiple institutions with medical education and informatics backgrounds and was identified by querying faculty presenting on resident clinical dashboards at the 2024 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine conference. Additional authors were identified by members of the initial group. Best practice literature was referenced; if none was available, group consensus was used.<h4>Categories of metrics</h4>Clinical exposures as well as efficiency, quality, documentation, and diversity metrics may be included in a resident dashboard. Resident dashboard metrics should focus on resident-sensitive measures rather than those primarily affected by attendings or systems-based factors.<h4>Considerations for implementation</h4>Implementation of these dashboards requires the technical expertise to turn EHR data into actionable data, a process called EHR phenotyping. The dashboard can be housed directly in the EHR or on a separate platform. Dashboard developers should consider how their implementation plan will affect how often dashboard data will be refreshed and how to best display the data for ease of understanding.<h4>Implications for education & training</h4>Dashboards can provide objective data to residents, residency leadership and clinical competency committees as they identify areas of strength, growth areas, and set specific and actionable goals. The success of resident dashboards is reliant on resident buy-in and creating a culture of psychological safety through thoughtful implementation, coaching, and regular feedback. .<h4>Conclusion</h4>Personalized clinical dashboards can play a crucial role in programmatic assessment within CBME, helping EM residents focus their efforts as they advance and refine their skills during training.",Moser JS; Genes N; Hekman DJ; Krzyzaniak SM; Layng TA; Miller D; Rider AC; Sagalowsky ST; Smith ME; Schnapp BH,BerbeeWalsh Department of Emergency Medicine University of Wisconsin Madison Wisconsin USA.,AEM education and training,2025-04-29,10.1002/aet2.70020,6.9,"dashboard(title,abstract); data(abstract); informatics(abstract); electronic health record(abstract)",
40298436,Detection of Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels 1.3 via Immuno-PET Visualizes Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting approximately 1% of the global population, yet current diagnostic tools for early-stage RA lack sensitivity and fail to identify optimal treatment candidates. Voltage-gated potassium channel 1.3 (Kv1.3) plays a crucial role in immune cell activation, particularly in effector memory T lymphocytes and macrophages, which drive inflammation in active RA. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a novel Kv1.3-targeted radiopharmaceutical, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-anti-Kv1.3, for precise monitoring and quantification of joint inflammation in a mouse model of RA. PET imaging revealed significantly higher radioactivity concentration in inflamed joints compared to normal joints at all time points, with peak uptake of 11.73 %ID/g at 4 h postinjection compared to 1.55 %ID/g in noninflamed joints. Histological analysis confirmed the presence of T lymphocytes and macrophages in inflamed tissues and their high Kv1.3 expression. Additionally, tracer uptake correlated strongly with clinical arthritis scores (Pearson <i>r</i> = 0.8789, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), demonstrating the probe's sensitivity in tracking arthritis progression. This study successfully developed a <sup>68</sup>Ga-labeled Kv1.3-targeting radiopharmaceutical that enables visualization of active inflammation in arthritic joints, showing high sensitivity for early RA diagnosis and disease monitoring. This approach offers potential for guiding immune-targeted therapies and assessing the treatment efficacy in RA.",Cheng S; Quan Y; Long X; Lan X; Jiang D; Liu K; Fan C,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.",Molecular pharmaceutics,2025-04-29,10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5c00357,4.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Rheumatoid arthritis; Nuclear Medicine; PET imaging; Immuno-pet; Voltage-gated Potassium Channels 1.3
40317226,Prototyping Intelligent Software Solutions for Global Health Engagement. ,"Understanding the Global Health Engagement (GHE) landscape is the key to effective military planning and execution across tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Global Health Engagements are intended to both help partner nations achieve the capacity, capability, and interoperability necessary to provide care to their own and also delivering an appropriate standard of care to U.S. service members, when needed. As standards and capabilities vary globally, planning GHEs is increasingly data-driven, relying on sources focused on GHE information requirements as well as those focused on GHE-supportive information needs. Current challenges to the use of GHE data in planning and crisis management are its lack of availability, standardization, integration, and visualization. Solving these challenges requires improved data curation, analysis, and user interface design to properly optimize engagements and care delivery. Our research focused on supporting the Center for Global Health Engagement's (CGHE) ability to effectively plan, execute, and track a range of these engagements across the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. We leveraged Machine Learning (ML) capabilities including Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist users in making sense of large and disparate datasets. Our solution focused on automating the ingestion of data from unstructured text (GHE surveys), establishing a unified and standardized data format, developing interactive analytic tools, and presenting the results through user-specific visualizations to support decision-making and risk-informed course of action recommendations. To curate, analyze, and visualize GHE data, we developed a prototype ML algorithm that employs an LLM for global health tactical-level hospital data ingestion, curation aggregation, and analysis and displays results for patient distribution in response to a crisis scenario using a 3D geospatial mapping visualization tool. The resulting capability uses an advanced, adaptive User Interface to visualize outputs from the ML algorithm, including providing explanations in a human-readable format on how the algorithm arrived at these outputs. The results provide practical applications for proof of concept of AI assistance in supporting global health data processing and analysis, with applications extending to the biosurveillance, medical countermeasures, and medical logistics domains. This study has direct implications for understanding partner healthcare capabilities and integrating them into military healthcare plans to support military and medical decision-making for operational planning, crisis management and conflict healthcare delivery and the planning and execution of future health engagements.",Sussman-Fort J; Glenister L; Jankowski D; Petroff N; Wilson CRL; Cohn CJ,"Soar Technology, LLC, Orlando, FL 32817, United States.",Military medicine,2025-05-03,10.1093/milmed/usaf164,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(abstract),
40307726,Unveiling the immune microenvironment of complex tissues and tumors in transcriptomics through a deconvolution approach.,"Accurately resolving the composition of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes is pivotal for advancing cancer immunotherapy strategies. Despite the success of some clinical trials, applying these strategies remains limited due to the challenges in deciphering the immune microenvironment. In this study, we developed a streamlined, two-step workflow to address the complexity of bioinformatics processes involved in analyzing immune cell composition from transcriptomics data. Our dockerized toolkit, DOCexpress_fastqc, integrates the hisat2-stringtie pipeline with customized scripts within Galaxy/Docker environments, facilitating RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) gene expression profiling. The output from DOCexpress_fastqc is seamlessly formatted with mySORT, a web application that employs a deconvolution algorithm to determine the immune content across 21 cell subclasses. We validated mySORT using synthetic pseudo-bulk data derived from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Our predictions exhibit strong concordance with the ground-truth immune cell composition, achieving Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.871 in melanoma patients and 0.775 in head and neck cancer patients. Additionally, mySORT outperforms existing methods like CIBERSORT in accuracy and provides a wide range of data visualization features, such as hierarchical clustering and cell complexity plots. The toolkit and web application are freely available for the research community, providing enhanced resolution for conventional bulk RNA sequencing data and facilitating the analysis of immune microenvironment responses in immunotherapy.

40312715,Strengthening nutrition routine data using institutionalized health management information systems for decision making: analysis of best practices and lessons learned from implementation in Burkina Faso.,"Strengthening nutrition routine information system is critical to support nutrition programs with relevant data to inform decision-making. This study analyzed the practices and lessons learned from the implementation in Burkina Faso in strengthening nutrition routine data using institutionalized health management information systems for decision making.Methods This qualitative study was conducted in Burkina Faso in 2022 on the capitalization of best practices after 3 years of implementation through documentary review, semi-structured individual interviews with 64 key implementing informants spread over 2 health districts, 2 regional hospital centers and 2 health regions, and a national triangulation workshop with 40 implementing actors, including 20 from the central level, 15 from the decentralized level, and 5 partners.Results The results of the study show the best practices and progress identified: (i) the integration of new routine data elements and nutrition indicators into District Health Information Software (DHIS2), which filled the data gap for adequate monitoring of the nutrition program; (ii) the design and use of the nutrition indicator dashboard; (iii) data validation and performance review sessions which have improved the quality and use of routine data in decision-making; and (iv) decentralization of data entry of monthly activity reports of health facilities. Lessons learned included: (i) conducting a small-scale phase to test the indicators is an important step to take before national scale-up of the indicators; (ii) a participatory approach involving all actors at different levels is important; (iii) advocacy is important to integrate prevention indicators into health facilities information systems in a more curative-oriented health system; (iv) the decentralized entry of data is a best practice that improves data quality in terms of timeliness, completeness, and internal consistency.Conclusion Beyond the inclusion of indicators, special emphasis should be placed on working on data quality.

40293683,Predictive models of severe disease in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at an early stage on CT images using topological properties.,"Prediction of severe disease (SVD) in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia at an early stage could allow for more appropriate triage and improve patient prognosis. Moreover, the visualization of the topological properties of COVID-19 pneumonia could help clinical physicians describe the reasons for their decisions. We aimed to construct predictive models of SVD in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at an early stage on computed tomography (CT) images using SVD-specific features that can be visualized on accumulated Betti number (BN) maps. BN maps (b0 and b1 maps) were generated by calculating the BNs within a shifting kernel in a manner similar to a convolution. Accumulated BN maps were constructed by summing BN maps (b0 and b1 maps) derived from a range of multiple-threshold values. Topological features were computed as intrinsic topological properties of COVID-19 pneumonia from the accumulated BN maps. Predictive models of SVD were constructed with two feature selection methods and three machine learning models using nested fivefold cross-validation. The proposed model achieved an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.854 and a sensitivity of 0.908 in a test fold. These results suggested that topological image features could characterize COVID-19 pneumonia at an early stage as SVD.",Iwasaki T; Arimura H; Inui S; Kodama T; Cui YH; Ninomiya K; Iwanaga H; Hayashi T; Abe O,"Division of Medical Quantum Science, Department of Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. iwasakit-rad@h.u-tokyo.ac.jp.",Radiological physics and technology,2025-04-28,10.1007/s12194-025-00906-1,3.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract),Predictive model; Severity; Topological Features; Covid-19; Accumulated Betti Number Map
40300572,Investigation of Recognition Areas by Explainable AI for Colonoscopy Images of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"<h4>Introduction and aim</h4>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a condition in which gastroenterological endoscopists cannot detect anomalies using colonoscopy, yet an artificial intelligence (AI) developed for IBS colonoscopy images has been able to distinguish between IBS and healthy individuals with high accuracy. However, it was unclear in which areas the AI identified as abnormal. The aim of this study was to elucidate how AI identifies regions typical of IBS by constructing an additional Explainable AI (XAI).<h4>Methods</h4>Colonoscopy images of healthy individuals, patients with constipation-predominant IBS, and patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS, which are available in a repository (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9s4mw6mkp), were used. After setting up a Python environment on a local PC, the XAI models for the three groups were developed. Images not used in the AI construction were then evaluated using XAI. XAI-generated images were independently assessed by two evaluators, HM and KS, to record and reconcile the characteristic differences among the three groups.<h4>Results</h4>Images correctly identified as those of healthy individuals by XAI were evaluated as characteristics over the entire image. By contrast, for IBS, only parts of the images were evaluated as characteristic regions. For diarrhea-predominant IBS, regions characterized by clear vascular boundaries, homogeneity or erythematous tones, or narrow and somewhat dark-appearing sections of the intestinal tract were identified. For constipation-predominant IBS, regions characterized by unclear vascular boundaries, faded tones, or dark sections where the end was not visible were identified.<h4>Conclusion</h4>An XAI for IBS was collaboratively developed by endoscopists and clinical engineers, enabling the visualization of regions characteristic of IBS and healthy individuals. The real-time display of XAI is expected to further advance the elucidation of IBS pathophysiology.",Mihara H; Kuraishi S; Fujinami H; Ando T; Yasuda I,,Digestion,2025-04-29,10.1159/000546183,3.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract),
40300861,Exploring Health Care Professionals' Engagement With a Precision Dosing Calculator and Supporting Clinical Information: Insights From an Eye-Tracking and Usability Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Pharmacokinetic-based dosing calculators for individualized drug dosing remain underutilized in clinical practice, often due to poor usability and a lack of user-centered design. Understanding how health care professionals interact with these tools can inform design strategies and enhance usability.<h4>Methods</h4>Health care professionals wore eye-tracking glasses while using a codesigned vancomycin dosing calculator with supporting clinical information to complete example clinical scenarios. Eye-tracking data were collected for 23 predefined areas of interest, and fixation sequences were analyzed. A Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire was administered to assess the tool's perceived usability.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven pharmacists and three doctors participated in the study. The highest average dwell times were recorded for the pharmacokinetic plot, dosage regimen selection, dosing history, drug concentrations, and the area under the concentration-time curve and dose visualization area. Participants generally viewed patient demographic information first and pharmacokinetic and dosage regimen information last. Considerable heterogeneity was observed among participants' fixation sequences, with frequent eye movements between key areas, particularly between the pharmacokinetic plot and dosage regimen selection, and between dosing history and drug concentrations. Participants expressed a preference for these elements to be positioned close together.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Understanding how health care professionals interact with decision support systems is essential for developing user-friendly tools that align with clinical workflows. Eye-tracking data provided valuable insights into user engagement patterns with the dosing calculator and clinical information interface. These insights will guide future design strategies to address usability barriers that limit the utilization of dosing calculators in clinical practice and promote the implementation of individualized drug dosing.",Wong S; Selby PR; Ward MB; Reuter SE,"UniSA Clinical and Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia; and.",Therapeutic drug monitoring,2025-04-29,10.1097/ftd.0000000000001337,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Usability; therapeutic drug monitoring; Eye-tracking; Individualized Dosing; Dosing Software
40306673,"""Be Really Careful about That"": Clinicians' Perceptions of an Intelligence Augmentation Tool for In-Hospital Deterioration Detection.","<h4>Objective</h4> This study aimed to explore clinicians' perceptions and preferences of prototype intelligence augmentation (IA)-based visualization displays of in-hospital deterioration risk scores to inform future user interface design and implementation in clinical care.<h4>Methods</h4> Prototype visualization displays incorporating an IA-based early warning score (EWS) for in-hospital deterioration were developed using cognitive theory and user-centered design principles. The displays featured variations of EWS and clinical data arranged in multipatient and single-patient views. Physician and nurse participants with at least 5 years of clinical experience were recruited to participate in semistructured qualitative interviews focused on understanding their experiences with IA and thoughts and preferences about the prototype displays. A thematic analysis was performed on these data.<h4>Results</h4> Six themes were identified: (1) clinicians perceive IA as valuable with some caveats related to function and context; (2) individual differences among users influence preferences for customizability; (3) EWS are particularly useful for patient triage; (4) need for patient-centered contextual information to complement EWS; (5) perspectives related to understanding the EWS composition; and (6) design preferences that focus on clarity for interpretation of information.<h4>Conclusion</h4> This study demonstrates clinicians' interest in and reservations about IA tools for clinical deterioration. The findings underscore the importance of understanding clinicians' cognitive needs and framing IA-generated tools as complementary to support them. A clinician focuses on high-level pattern matching information, and clinician's comments related to the power of consistency with typical views (e.g., this is ""how I usually see things""), and questions regarding support of score interpretation (e.g., age of the data, questions about what the model ""knows"") suggest some of the challenges of IA implementation. The findings also identify design implications including the need for contextualizing the EWS for the patient's specific situation, incorporating trend information, and explaining the display purpose for clinical use.",Butler JM; Doubleday A; Sattar U; Nies M; Jeppesen A; Wright M; Reese T; Kawamoto K; Fiol GD; Madaras-Kelly K,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.",Applied clinical informatics,2025-04-30,10.1055/a-2505-7743,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40314762,Operational Taxon-Function Framework in MetaX: Unveiling Taxonomic and Functional Associations in Metaproteomics.,"Metaproteomics analyzes the functional dynamics of microbial communities by identifying peptides and mapping them to the most likely proteins and taxa. One challenge in this field lies in seamlessly integrating taxonomic and functional annotations to accurately represent the contributions of individual microbial taxa to functional diversity. We introduce MetaX, a comprehensive tool for analyzing taxon-function relationships in metaproteomics by mapping peptides to their lowest common ancestors and assigning functions based on proportional thresholds, ensuring accurate peptide-level mappings. Importantly, MetaX introduces the Operational Taxon-Function (OTF), a new conceptual unit for exploring microbial roles and interactions within ecosystems. Additionally, MetaX includes extensive statistical and visualization tools, establishing it as a robust platform for metaproteomics analysis. We validated MetaX by reanalyzing ex vivo gut microbiome metaproteomic data exposed to various sweeteners, yielding more detailed results than traditional protein analysis. Furthermore, using the peptide-centric approach and OTF, we observed that <i>Parabacteroides distasonis</i> significantly responds to certain sweeteners, highlighting its role in modifying specific metabolic functions. With its intuitive, user-friendly interface, MetaX facilitates a detailed study of the complex interactions between microbial taxa and their functions in metaproteomics.

40307540,A bibliometric analysis of rheumatology: knowledge structure and research trends of RNA-Binding proteins in rheumatic diseases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Rheumatic disease is a kind of disease dominated by inflammatory lesions of connective tissue and abnormal immune function. It mostly belongs to autoimmune diseases or connective tissue diseases affecting multiple organs. Meanwhile, understanding the role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in pathogenesis is rapidly developing. This study aims at summarizing the hotspots in rheumatology studies related to RBPs.<h4>Methods</h4>Scientific papers on RBPs related to rheumatology between 1982 and 2022 were gathered from the Web of Science database. The data analysis and visualization were obtained using the Bibliometrix package. Bibliometrix package was used to analyze bibliometric indicators and visualize the trends and hotspots of the research.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 964 articles met the requirement. From 1982 to 2022, the USA and Anhui Medical University were the most productive country and institution, respectively, in this field. Arthritis and Rheumatism, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases and Arthritis & Rheumatology were the top three periodicals obtained by Bradford's law. Co-word analysis divided the keywords into three clusters, focusing on diagnosis and classification of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis, respectively. Trend topic analysis revealed that pathogenesis and classification of rheumatic diseases might be the research trend.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Focusing on RBPs in rheumatic diseases, we illustrated the evolution of this field and predicted future research hotspots. The research trend topics have evolved towards clinical classification and pathogenesis at the molecular and genetic level. The pathogenic mechanism in rheumatic diseases will continue to be a hotspot in the future. Besides, the classification of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus patients may be another hotspot. Researchers are recommended to pay more attention to hotspots demonstrated in the future.

40314099,NLRP3 inflammasome expression affects immune cell infiltration and clinical prognosis in &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection‑associated gastric cancer.,"High <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection rates contribute to high gastric cancer (GC) incidence. While <i>H.</i> <i>pylori</i> infection is associated with GC development its mechanisms are still being studied. The aim of the present study was to examine the differences between <i>H. pylori</i> infection‑induced GC and non‑infected tissues, and to investigate the correlation between nucleotide‑binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome expression and immune cell infiltration in GC, thus providing a theoretical basis for clinical prognosis and immunotherapy. High‑throughput RNA‑sequencing expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed. Additionally, TIMER2.0 and Kaplan‑Meier Plotter were used to analyze the differential expression of NLRP3 mRNA in various tumors, the effect of <i>H. pylori</i> infection on gene expression, and the association between NLRP3 and clinical prognosis among patients with GC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to assess the effects of NLRP3 protein expression on immune cell infiltration in clinical tissues with or without <i>H. pylori</i> infection. R software was used for data visualization and statistical analysis. TCGA data revealed that the expression levels of NLRP3 in GC tissues were increased compared with those in normal tissues (P<0.05), which was further validated in clinical samples. Furthermore, NLRP3 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in clinical GC tissues infected with <i>H. pylori</i>. Notably higher relative levels of NLRP3 mRNA were observed in tumor tissues with a tumor size ≥5 cm, lymph node metastasis, Tumor‑Node‑Metastasis stage III + IV or poor differentiation compared with the respective controls (P<0.05). IHC confirmed a significant increase in NLRP3 expression within <i>H. pylori</i>‑infected GC tissues compared with that in non‑infected tissues. In GC immune infiltration, NLRP3 expression was revealed to be associated with natural killer cell, whereas it was negatively correlated with regulatory T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These findings indicated that NLRP3 may promote the polarization of tumor‑associated macrophages towards the M2 phenotype. High NLRP3 expression also promoted the infiltration of CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD206<sup>+</sup> cells, which significantly affected the survival rate of patients with GC. The immune infiltration of regulatory T lymphocytes was associated with better survival benefits for patients with GC; however, M2 macrophage infiltration was not conducive to the survival of patients with GC. Furthermore, survival analysis showed that high expression of NLRP3 was associated with a poorer 5‑year overall survival, progression‑free survival and post‑progression survival rates. In conclusion, elevated NLRP3 expression, which may be induced by <i>H. pylori</i> infection, could promote immune cell infiltration potentially by regulating cancer cell proliferation and migration, ultimately leading to an unfavorable prognosis and a notable reduction in the 5‑year survival rate.",Wan C; Xu Y; Zhu Y; Cao X; Wang P; Gu Y,"Central Laboratory, Changshu Medical Examination Institute, Changshu, Jiangsu 215500, P.R.

40301478,Arthroscopic versus open fixation for medial malleolus fractures improves trauma response and bone healing.,"Medial malleolus fracture is traditionally performed via an open approach. However, significant drawbacks such as exfoliated soft tissue injury, infection, prolonged recovery periods have been reported. Recently, arthroscopy-assisted reduction percutaneous internal fixation (ARPF) demonstrates advantages in minimizing soft tissue damage, improving joint visualization, and enhancing postoperative recovery, however, robust comparative evidence remains sparse on the efficacy of ARPF versus open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in treating medial malleolus fractures. The current study provides preliminary evidence suggesting the potential utility of trauma response indexes and bone metabolism markers in clinical outcomes evaluation associated with these two surgical techniques. A retrospective study was conducted on 60 patients with medial malleolus fractures from January 2021 to November 2023, The patients were divided into the ARPF (arthroscopy-assisted reduction and percutaneous internal fixation) group (n = 28) and the ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) group (n = 32). The differences in preoperative general data, intraoperative bleeding volume, operation time, hospital stay, bone union time, and preoperative, postoperative 1 day, postoperative 3 days inflammatory response indicators [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), cortisol (Cor), norepinephrine (NE)] and preoperative, postoperative 2 weeks, 4 weeks bone metabolism markers [bone carboxyglutamicacid protein (BGP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), β-collagen degradation products (β-CTX)] levels, and postoperative 6 months, 1 year Olerud-Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) were compared. No significant differences were observed in age, gender, injury side, or cause of injury between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared to the ORIF group, the ARPF group exhibited reduced intraoperative blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and accelerated bone healing time. However, the duration of surgery was significantly longer (p < 0.05). Postoperative CRP levels on days 1 and 3 were lower in the ARPF group compared to the ORIF group. Similarly, IL-6 levels on days 1 and 3 were also lower in the ARPF group. Cor levels on days 1 and 3, as well as NE levels on days 1 and 3, were both lower in the ARPF group. At weeks 2 and 4 postoperatively, BGP and BALP levels were both higher, butβ-CTX levels were lower in the ARPF group. Additionally, the OMAS scores at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively were higher in the ARPF group. Arthroscopy-assisted reduction and percutaneous internal fixation for isolated medial malleolus fracture can minimize intraoperative bleeding, reduce trauma, expedite fracture healing, enhance ankle functional recovery, making it a valuable technique for clinical application.",Xie X; Ji D; Chen F; Lin Z; Deng K; Song J; Wang J,"Department of Trauma Orthopedics, Shenzhen Longhua District Central Hospital, Shenzhen, 518110, China.",Scientific reports,2025-04-29,10.1038/s41598-025-96078-4,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Open Reduction Internal Fixation; Medial Malleolus Fracture; Bone Metabolism Markers; Trauma Response Indexes; Arthroscopy-assisted
39642263,When a Horseshoe Is Not a Lucky Find.,<h4>Abstract</h4>Identification of a neonatal horseshoe kidney in the emergency department is uncommon but has implications for future healthcare planning for patients. We present a case of a neonate with bloody diapers who was evaluated with renal point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) that identified a horseshoe kidney. The ultrasound was remarkable for its clear visualization of the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney in the midline abdomen. Midline interrogation is not part of the routine technique for ultrasound imaging of the kidney but should be considered when the limits of the lower pole of bilateral kidneys are difficult to visualize. This case highlights the importance of understanding normal anatomical landmarks when performing renal POCUS to identify renal anomalies.,Yim W; Subramaniam S,"Valley Health System Graduate Medical Education, Emergency Medicine Residency.",Pediatric emergency care,2025-04-30,10.1097/pec.0000000000003303,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Kidney; Renal; Point-of-care Ultrasound; Horseshoe
40295909,Development and validation of a prediction model for post-induction hypotension in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery: a prospective cohort study.,"<h4>Backgrounds</h4>Post-induction hypotension (PIH) is prevalent in elderly surgical patients and associated with adverse outcomes; however, predicting PIH remains challenging. We aimed to develop a feasible and practical PIH prediction model for elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>In this single-center prospective cohort study, 938 elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery were enrolled from December 2022 to May 2023 (n = 657 in the development cohort) and from June 2023 to August 2023 (n = 281 in the temporal validation cohort), respectively. The study outcome was the occurrence of PIH, defined as hypotension during the first 15 min after anesthesia induction or until skin incision (whichever occurred first). Predictors were determined based on LASSO and logistic regression analyses. A nomogram and a dynamic application were used for model visualization. The internal and temporal validation were performed to evaluate the discriminability, calibration and clinical utility.<h4>Results</h4>The median age was 71 years in both cohorts. The incidence of PIH was 51.6% and 50.5% in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. Cardiac function, baseline mean arterial pressure in the ward, etomidate use, and pre-induction mean arterial pressure were determined as predictors. The PIH prediction model was visualized as a nomogram and a dynamic application. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.680 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.639 to 0.720) in internal validation and 0.697 (95% CI: 0.635 to 0.759) in temporal validation. The mean absolute errors were 0.012 and 0.029 for the internal and temporal validation calibration curves, respectively. The Brier score was 0.223. The decision curve analysis indicated that the model had a gain in predicting PIH.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A PIH prediction model with four predictors was developed and validated for elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. This model provides a foundation for future refinements to enhance its value of assisting clinical decision-making across diverse healthcare settings.<h4>Trial registration</h4>This study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200066201).",Bian Z; Dou W; Ying Y; Shi H; Ji F; Hu J; Peng K,"Department of Anesthesiology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215006, China.",BMC anesthesiology,2025-04-28,10.1186/s12871-025-03090-2,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Prediction model; Elderly patients; Non-cardiac Surgery; Post-induction Hypotension

Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), an endogenous gasotransmitter with therapeutic potential, faces challenges in achieving pharmacological effects due to the unpredictable presence of inorganic H<sub>2</sub>S donors. To address these issues, we developed TMN-ONCS, a near-infrared fluorescent probe that integrates a <i>p</i>-tolyl isothiocyanate with a dicyanoisophorone fluorophore through a self-immolative spacer. TMN-ONCS demonstrates high selectivity and analytical performance for cysteine, avoids the generation of multiple fluorophores seen in conventional isothiocyanate probes, and functions as a cysteine-activated fluorescent H<sub>2</sub>S donor with concurrent visualization.

40309042,A UK single-center pilot experience using a novel robotic inchworm colonoscopy system.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Colonoscopy is the gold standard investigation in the lower gastrointestinal tract. However, 75% of patients can experience pain with moderate sedation. The application of robotic technology aims to overcome difficulties faced including better utilization of rooms for advanced procedures and to achieve a complete colonoscopy in patients restricted by pain and technical challenges.<h4>Methods</h4>This pilot study, the first at a UK-National Health Service Hospital between January 2023 to August 2024 with one expert endoscopist performing the robotic colonoscopy (RC). Patients with failed previous standard colonoscopy (SC) along with index diagnostic procedures deemed potentially difficult were recruited. Procedures were performed outside the endoscopy unit similar to an outpatient clinical room.<h4>Results</h4>Ninety-three patients were recruited (41 men:52 women), mean age of 53.8 years over 20 months. The commonest indications for RC were rectal bleeding (26.9%), failed SC (22.6%), and change in bowel habits (17.2%). Twenty-one patients had failed the previous SC with 14 patients achieving completion with subsequent RC (66% improvement). The average cecal intubation time of 41.07 min with an average total procedure time of 76.48 min. A significant improvement in patient discomfort score was reported (4.71 SC vs. 1.71 RC; <i>p</i> < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>RC provides a significantly more comfortable colonoscopy and has great potential to improve safety in colonoscopy from this early cohort of patients. Direct visualization, biopsy, and polypectomy are still possible with RC. This study has demonstrated a viable alternative to SC. With no sedation it allows procedures to be conducted outside the traditional endoscopy unit such as outpatients. The study highlights a learning curve to reduce cecal intubation time.",Ahmed JF; Coda S; Premchand P; Banerjee S; Patel N,The Hamlyn Center Imperial College London London UK.,DEN open,2025-04-29,10.1002/deo2.70123,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Pain; Colonoscopy; Robotics; Discomfort; Outpatients
40317604,The Evolution of Fluorescein into a Potential Theranostic Tool. ,"Recent advances in drug discovery and development have been marked by the emergence of new modalities, including small molecule theranostic agents. While initial results from clinical trials have been promising, modern detectable inhibitors are still in an early stage of development. In this study, we present a strategy for chemically evolving a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic entity, which not only retains its properties but also enhances its inhibition and detection applicability. By utilizing 15-LOX-1 as a model system, we leverage prior knowledge of its inhibitors to rationally functionalize fluorescein, enabling the targeted and highly efficient synthesis of over 20 derivatives across four different scaffolds.

40299981,Imaging-Based Approach to Venous-Origin Chronic Pelvic Pain.,"Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a debilitating condition affecting up to 26% of women worldwide. Among its many causes, pelvic venous disorders (PeVD) is increasingly recognized as an underdiagnosed contributor, often overlooked due to its non-specific presentation. PeVD results from venous reflux, or obstruction, leading to venous hypertension, congestion, and chronic pain. Advanced imaging techniques play a pivotal role in diagnosing PeVD, differentiating it from other etiologies of CPP. Ultrasound, particularly Doppler imaging, serves as the firstline modality for assessing venous reflux and dilation. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance venography provide detailed anatomical and haemodynamic evaluations, aiding in the identification of compressive syndromes and collateral pathways. Selective venography remains the gold standard, offering real-time visualization of reflux severity and guiding minimally invasive interventions such as venous embolization. Despite these advances, PeVD remains underrecognized in clinical practice, leading to delays in diagnosis and management. Increased awareness and standardized diagnostic criteria are crucial for improving patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach incorporating radiologists, gynecologists, and vascular specialists is essential for the comprehensive evaluation and treatment of PeVD. Emerging therapies, including endovascular techniques, offer promising options for symptom relief, reducing the need for invasive surgical procedures. This review highlights the pathophysiology, imaging modalities, and evolving management strategies for PeVD, emphasizing the importance of early recognition and intervention in patients with CPP.",Moosa V; Ni T; Friedman I; Brown AD,"Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.",Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes,2025-04-29,10.1177/08465371251336121,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Venous Disease; Pelvic Pain; Diagnostic Imaging; Pelvic Venous Congestion; Pelvic Venous Disorder
40295627,Identification and quantification of muscular cocontraction for ankle rehabilitation through variational mode decomposition in surface electromyography.,"The ankle joint plays important role in performing fundamental activities such as walking and other essential daily tasks. Ankle stabilization and muscle co-contraction are crucial for rehabilitating gait abnormalities, as impaired ankle function disrupts gait, causes pain and inflammation, and hampers recovery. Accurate assessment of muscle co-contraction is crucial for developing effective non-pharmacological interventions. This paper introduces a novel approach using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) combined with scalogram visualization technique to analyze surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals from antagonist muscles of the lower limb and assesses muscular co-contraction using the coscalogram function. The present study compares VMD with the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) approach and shows that VMD outperforms CWT in terms of both SNR and RMSE. On average, the increase in SNR in case of VMD (-17.65 ± 8.1dB to 2.98 ± 2.2dB) was greater than that of CWT (-17.65 ± 3.7dB to 1.34 ± 1.5dB). Similarly, the reduction in RMSE with VMD (0.023 ± 0.0029 to 0.017 ± 0.0015) surpassed that achieved with CWT (0.023 ± 0.0027 to 0.020 ± 0.0025). This enhanced accuracy in identifying co-contraction events has the potential to significantly improve clinical assessment and rehabilitation strategies for patients with ankle joint pathologies. To further validate VMD's effectiveness, we quantitatively assessed co-contraction events by comparing mean peak amplitudes identified using VMD and CWT. Our analysis, which revealed that VMD consistently captured stronger co-contraction events (higher mean peak amplitudes), supports VMD's superiority in accurately identifying and quantifying ankle muscle co-contraction. These results have significant implications for clinical practice, offering the potential for more precise assessments of ankle joint function and the development of more targeted and effective rehabilitation interventions.",Yasmeen S; Waris A; Amin F; Iqbal J; Gilani SO; Khan MJ; Hazzazi F; Imran A; Shah UH; Ijaz MA,"Department of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences, School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan.",Scientific reports,2025-04-28,10.1038/s41598-025-96334-7,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Co-contraction; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Semg; Ankle Rehabilitation; Scalogram; Variational Mode Decomposition
40314842,Widespread distribution of α-synuclein oligomers in LRRK2-related Parkinson's disease.,"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). While the clinical features of patients with LRRK2-PD resemble those of typical PD, there are significant differences in the pathological findings. The pathological hallmark of definite PD is the presence of α-synuclein (αSYN)-positive Lewy-related pathology; however, approximately half of patients with LRRK2-PD do not have Lewy-related pathology. Lewy-related pathology is a late-stage αSYN aggregation that can be visualized with hematoxylin and eosin stains or conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC). Increasing evidence has indicated that αSYN oligomers, which represent the early-stage of αSYN aggregation, may have neurotoxicity. Visualization of αSYN oligomers requires specialized staining techniques, such as αSYN-proximity ligation assay (PLA). Distribution and severity of αSYN oligomers in the brain of patients with LRRK2-PD remain unknown. In this study, we performed phosphorylated αSYN-IHC and αSYN-PLA staining on postmortem brain sections of patients with three pathogenic LRRK2 mutants: p.G2019S (n = 5), p.I2020T (n = 5), and p.R1441C (n = 4). The severity of Lewy-related pathology and αSYN oligomers was assessed semi-quantitatively in the brainstem, limbic lobe, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. αSYN oligomers were detected in patients with LRRK2-PD even in those without Lewy-related pathology; a negative correlation was observed between Lewy-related pathology and αSYN oligomers (r = - 0.26 [- 0.39, - 0.12]; P < 0.0001). Our findings suggest that αSYN oligomers may represent a common pathological feature of LRRK2-PD. Notably, patients harboring p.G2019S and p.I2020T had significantly higher levels of αSYN oligomers in those without Lewy-related pathology compared to those with Lewy-related pathology. These patients also had a trend toward shorter disease duration. These results imply that in LRRK2-PD, αSYN oligomers may initially accumulate in the brain but do not progress to form Lewy-related pathology. The present study suggests that targeting αSYN oligomers may be a therapeutic strategy for LRRK2-PD even if there is no Lewy-related pathology.",Sekiya H; Franke L; Hashimoto Y; Takata M; Nishida K; Futamura N; Hasegawa K; Kowa H; Ross OA; McLean PJ; Toda T; Wszolek ZK; Dickson DW,"Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, 4500 San Pablo Road, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA. sekiya.hiroaki@mayo.edu.",Acta neuropathologica,2025-05-02,10.1007/s00401-025-02872-9,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Pathogenesis; Parkinson disease; Oligomers; Lewy bodies; alpha-Synuclein; Lrrk2

Sequences included T1 and T2 weighted with turbo-spin-echo (TSE) correction and fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR). Images were analyzed for visualization of intracranial structures by two neuroradiologists.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Visibility of 14 structures graded on a four-point Likert scale. Average scores per structure and sequence were compared using paired two-tailed t-tests and change in mode score.<h4>Results</h4>Ten patients underwent pre- and post-MAR MRI. Six had a unilateral CI, three had a unilateral ABI, and one had an ABI and CI. Three patients had four devices with the internal magnet removed for both scans. All structures had significantly improved visibility on post-MAR scan except ipsilateral parietal and occipital lobes and contralateral inner ear. Mode score increased from 2 to 4 for the ipsilateral occipital lobe and from 3 to 4 for the ipsilateral semicircular canals, brainstem, and cerebellar peduncles. Significant improvement was seen in all sequences except for ipsilateral structures on T1w axial precontrast and contralateral structures on T1w coronal postcontrast. ABIs did not improve as much as CIs because they scored better on the pre-MAR scan.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MAR techniques improve image quality for patients with MRI-compatible implants with magnets.

40305956,Dosimetric impact of iodinated contrast agent on planning CT for volumetric-modulated radiotherapy of head and neck cancer.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Volumetric-modulated arc therapy for head and neck cancers requires accurate delineation of target volumes and organs at risk. Iodinated contrast agents enhance visualization, but their impact on dose distribution remains a concern. Traditionally, dosimetry is performed on non-contrast CT scans to minimize dose calculation discrepancies. This study evaluates the dosimetric impact of planning directly on contrast-enhanced CT scans.<h4>Material and methods</h4>Twelve patients with head and neck cancers (oral cavity, oropharynx, pharyngolarynx, ethmoid, thyroid) treated using volumetric-modulated radiation technique were included. Target and organs at risk delineation and dose calculation were performed on contrast-enhanced CT scans and subsequently transferred to non-contrast CT scans without renormalization. Prescribed doses for high-risk planning target volume were 60 to 70Gy, for low-risk planning target volume 54Gy, in 30 to 33 fractions. Volumetric-modulated arc therapy planning was performed on Eclipse® (version 15.6), with simultaneous integrated boost, using the AAA dose calculation algorithm. Dosimetric variations in organs at risk and planning target volumes were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Mean variations of mean dose for organs at risk mandible, larynx, parotid glands, and pharyngeal constrictor muscle ranged from 0.02Gy (0.10 %) to 0.16Gy (0.38 %). Mean D2 % variations for spinal canal, brainstem, brachial plexus, and carotid arteries ranged from 0.05Gy (0.17 %) to 0.16Gy (0.46 %). None of the variations for organs at risk were found to be statistically or clinically significant. For planning target volumes, variations in coverage by the 95 % isodose of the prescribed dose were always less than 1 %. The maximum variation of maximum dose was a decrease of 0.6Gy, representing 0.8 %.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Performing volumetric-modulated arc therapy planning directly on contrast-enhanced CT scans leads to minimal dosimetric variations (less than 1 %) compared to non-contrast CT scans. This approach could streamline clinical workflows by eliminating the need for dual CT acquisitions and optimizing treatment preparation.",Leyrat B; Biau J; Berger L; Millardet C; Lapeyre M,"Radiation Department, centre Jean-Perrin, 63011 Clermont-Ferrand, France; UFR de médecine, université Clermont-Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.",Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique,2025-04-29,10.1016/j.canrad.2025.104623,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Head And Neck Cancer; Dosimetry; Contrast-enhanced Ct; Vmat; Dosimétrie; Cancer De La Tête Et Du Cou; Scanographie; Produit De Contraste
40316409,Improvement in safety measures to reduce ED returns.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Emergency department (ED) return cases as critical or deceased pose a significant concern for any healthcare organisation and need to be evaluated and addressed.<h4>Objectives</h4>A quality improvement initiative was implemented to reduce 50% of the return visits from the baseline proportion of return visits by critical/deceased adult patients to the ED within 72 hours of discharge during 1 year (January 2022-January 2023), which is a robust quality indicator. Additionally, factors that contribute to an admission or revisit within 72 hours of ED discharge were evaluated.<h4>Methodology</h4>The implementation of initiatives began in January 2022 to monitor the ED return cases. Interventions were developed using the plan-do-study-act cycles in January 2022. Cycle 1 captured ED returns within 72 hours that were flagged by daily systemic trigger notifications received through the email by the dashboard and the cases were analysed by our quality improvement specialists team daily in January 2022. In any sentinel or severe event, an escalation via SMS to the leadership ensured immediate attention and action. Cycle 2 included patient safety leadership meetings within 24 hours of the return visit. This was initiated in April 2022 and discussed with all stakeholders for the immediate implementation of recommendations and action plans to improve the system and address individual concerns. Cycle 3 included a comprehensive consultation checklist integrated into the HIS in July 2023 to ensure that all necessary steps and consultations were completed during discharge. This included specific questions regarding the consultant's awareness about the treatment plan provided to the patient.<h4>Results</h4>A statistical process control chart was used to present the data through the dashboard from January 2021 to January 2023 and continued until December 2023. The results revealed significant improvements. Overall, the number of return patients in the ED reduced by 46.60% from 0.13% in 2021 to 0.08% in 2022 and 2023.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The project was highly effective for patients. It reduced the morbidity and mortality for these patients over time; however, it also increased immature admissions. Continuous monitoring and application of different measures to analyse ED return cases are recommended.",Almugren GF; Al Katheri M; Al Khathaami AM; Al-Qahtani AH; Al Saawi A; Javellana S; Basakran M; Al Yehya S; Al Qarni MS,"Quality and Patient Safety Department, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia ghadah.almugren@gmail.com.",BMJ open quality,2025-05-02,10.1136/bmjoq-2024-003015,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Quality improvement; Patient Safety; Patient Satisfaction; Emergency Department
40299477,Telehealth Initiative to Enhance Primary Care Access in Brazil (UBS+Digital Project): Multicenter Prospective Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Brazil faces significant inequities in health care access, particularly in remote communities. The Brazilian Unified Health System is struggling to deliver adequate health care to its vast population. Telehealth, regulated in Brazil starting in 2022, emerged as a solution to improve access and quality of care. Thus, the Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, in partnership with the Agência Brasileira de Apoio à Gestão do Sistema Único de Saúde, created the Unidade Básica de Saúde (UBS)+Digital project, which aimed to mitigate the lack of medical care in remote areas of Brazil by providing teleconsultation in primary health units (PHUs) across the country. Through teletraining and digital health strategies, the initiative enabled health care professionals to provide remote assistance, improving access to medical care.<h4>Objective</h4>To describe the implementation and results of the UBS+Digital project, a telehealth initiative focused on training health care professionals, providing teleconsultations, and monitoring key performance indicators among PHUs in Brazil.<h4>Methods</h4>The study examined 15 Brazilian PHUs using a multicenter, prospective design. Data were collected through anonymous surveys of patients and physicians, which were recorded in the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) database. PHUs were selected based on criteria such as the absence of an on-site physician and existing technological infrastructure. Synchronous and asynchronous training was provided, focusing on digital health and teleconsultation skills. In loco training included workshops and community events to share experiences and foster local engagement. A community of practice facilitated ongoing knowledge exchange. Teleconsultations followed the person-centered clinical method and Calgary-Cambridge methodology. Key performance indicators were monitored by a dashboard to guide continuous improvement. The transition of operations was managed based on physician availability and project duration. Microcosting analysis assessed the project's economic impact using Brazilian guidelines, with statistical analysis performed using Jamovi software.<h4>Results</h4>From March to November 2023, the project conducted 6312 telehealth sessions. A total of 342 professionals were trained, including participants from all three training modalities that were implemented. The Net Promoter Score for teleconsultations was 97, indicating excellent service quality. Of the teleconsultations, 65.3% (4009/6140) were prescheduled, and 34.7% (2130/6140) were on demand, depending on the family health team organization. Teleconsultations resolved 85% (5219/6140) of cases, with 15% (921/6140) requiring in-person referrals or emergency care. The average absenteeism rate was 15% (1083/7223), and consultation durations were between 15 and 20 minutes, suggesting potential adjustments in scheduling.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results highlight the effectiveness of telehealth programs in primary care settings with limited medical professionals. The UBS+Digital project demonstrated that telehealth can enhance health care access, presenting a pioneering model within the Brazilian Unified Health System for digital primary care.",Lamas CA; Santana Alves PG; Nader de Araújo L; de Souza Paes AB; Cielo AC; Maciel de Almeida Lopes L; Longo Araújo de Melo A; Yokoyama T; Pagani Savastano C; Gobi Scudeller P; Carvalho C; ,"Saude Digital, Nucleo de Inovacao Tecnologica (InovaHC), Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo (HCFMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-04-29,10.2196/68434,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Innovation; Primary Health Care; Public Health Service; Telehealth; Digital Health
40294411,A Digital Outpatient Service With a Mobile App for Tailored Care and Health Literacy in Adults With Long-Term Health Service Needs: Multicenter Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>Patients with long-term health needs are often expected to actively participate in outpatient care, assuming that they have appropriate health literacy and digital health literacy. However, the association between participation in a digital outpatient service and health literacy remain unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to evaluate whether digital outpatient care for 6 months improved health literacy, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), digital/eHealth literacy, and the use of health care services compared with usual care.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a multicenter nonrandomized trial with 1 intervention arm and 1 control arm. Patients aged ≥18 years receiving outpatient care in the pain, lung, neurology, or cancer departments at 2 Norwegian university hospitals were allocated in a 1:2 ratio, favoring the intervention arm. The intervention arm received digital outpatient care using tailored patient-reported outcome measures, self-monitoring, and chats for timely contact with the outpatient clinic. Patient responses were assessed by health care workers via a dashboard with a traffic light system to draw attention to the most urgent reports. The control arm received usual care. The data were collected at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome was the change in health literacy according to the Health Literacy Questionnaire domain understanding health information well enough to know what to do from baseline to 6 months. The mean difference in change between the 2 treatment arms was the effect measure. The secondary outcomes were additional domains from the Health Literacy Questionnaire, digital/eHealth literacy, HRQoL, acceptability of the digital intervention, and health service use.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 162 patients were recruited, 55 (34%) in the control arm and 107 (66%) in the intervention arm, with a 17.3% attrition rate after 6 months. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome, ""understanding health information well enough to know what to do,"" between the arms at 6 months (mean difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.10; P=.53). After 3 months, the health literacy domains actively managing my own health (-0.15, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.00; P=.048) and understanding health information well enough to know what to do (-0.17, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.00; P=.03), as well as both physical (-3.29, 95% CI -5.62 to -0.96; P=.006) and mental HRQoL (-3.08, 95% CI -5.64 to -0.52; P=.02), improved in the digital outpatient intervention arm compared with the control arm.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study explored digital outpatient care. Although no statistical differences were observed in patients' health literacy after 6 months, our data indicate an improvement in health literacy domains and HRQoL at 3 months. The participants reported high satisfaction with the digital outpatient care intervention, and our findings highlight the potential of digital interventions in outpatient care.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05068869; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05068869.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>RR2-10.2196/46649.",Holmen H; Holm AM; Falk RS; Kilvær TK; Ljosaa TM; Ekholdt C; Fosse E,"Intervention Centre, Division of Technology and Innovation, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-04-28,10.2196/60343,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Epilepsy; Cancer; Outpatient; Self-monitoring; Health Literacy; Interstitial Lung Disease; Remote Monitoring; Patient-reported Outcome Measures; Mhealth; Mobile Health; Complex Pain; Digital Solution
40300151,mHealth Apps Available in Italy to Support Health Care Professionals in Antimicrobial Stewardship Implementation: Systematic Search in App Stores and Content Analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major challenge of the 21st century. Digital technologies are now an increasingly effective means of supporting optimal health care delivery and public health.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to explore the apps available to support health care professionals in the fight against AMR.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 4 independent researchers conducted a systematic search of the App Store and Google Play Store using the following keywords: ""antimicrobial resistance,"" ""antibiotic resistance,"" ""antimicrobial stewardship,"" ""antibiotic stewardship,"" ""antibiotic guide,"" ""antibiotic therapy,"" and ""antimicrobial therapy."" The same keywords were also searched in Italian. The apps whose contents were in languages other than Italian or English, or apps which were games, or had multimedia or paid content and advertising, or apps for only specific pathologies were not considered. A set of basic information was collected for all apps found. After downloading the apps, they were evaluated using an 86-item checklist containing expert-validated criteria aggregated in the domains of pathogens and etiological agents, diagnosis and therapy support, AMR, dashboard function, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), notes and recordings, network, and technical characteristics of the app.<h4>Results</h4>First, 115 apps were identified: 31 apps for Android and 84 apps for iOS. By applying the exclusion criteria, 31 apps were excluded (16 for Android and 15 for iOS) for the following reasons: not available in Italian or English (6 apps), not freely available (14 apps), required registration (5 apps), and games (6 apps). The remaining 84 eligible apps (15 for Android and 69 for iOS) were downloaded, installed, and further analyzed using the same criteria, excluding 57 apps (48 for iOS and 9 for Android) for the following reasons: required further registration (16 apps), language other than Italian or English (17 apps), pathology specific (5 apps), paid content (8 apps), specific to veterinarians (4 apps), recreational apps (2 apps), referred to only scientific articles (1 app), no longer available (1 app), and not health care objectives (3 apps). The remaining 27 apps (6 for Android and 21 for iOS) were selected for in-depth analysis. Of the 27 apps that met the inclusion criteria, most apps did not fulfill the desirable aspects and only 2 of them achieved a fulfillment score of 36%. The highest scores were achieved for support for diagnosis and therapy (37%) and technical characteristics of the app (23%). Lower scores were achieved for AMS (8%), pathogens and etiological agents (4%), notes and records (3%), network (2%), AMR (1%), and dashboard function (1%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>None of the apps examined successfully provided the desired features and functions. To better engage of prescribers in the fight against AMR, the development of an app that meets the requirements is needed.",Russo G; Petrazzuolo A; Trivisani M; Virone G; Mazzolini E; Pecori D; Sartor A; Intini SG; Celotto S; Roncato R; Cocconi R; Arnoldo L; Brunelli L,"Department of Medicine, University of Udine, Via Colugna 50, Udine, 33100, Italy, 39 3492131278.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2025-04-29,10.2196/51122,1.5,dashboard(abstract),Application; Antimicrobial; Diagnosis; APP; Support; Antimicrobial resistance; Italy; Engagement; One Health; Antimicrobial Stewardship; Mhealth; Mobile Health; Prescribing Behaviors; Therapy Support
