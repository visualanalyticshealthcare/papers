41505790,"Technologies, Clinical Applications, and Implementation Barriers of Digital Twins in Precision Cardiology: Systematic Review.","<h4>Background</h4>Digital twin systems are emerging as promising tools in precision cardiology, enabling dynamic, patient-specific simulations to support diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment planning. However, the current landscape of cardiovascular digital twin development, validation, and implementation remains fragmented, with substantial variability in modeling approaches, data use, and reporting practices.<h4>Objective</h4>This systematic review aims to synthesize the current state of cardiovascular digital twin research by addressing 11 research questions spanning modeling technologies, data infrastructure, clinical applications, clinical impact, implementation barriers, and ethical considerations.<h4>Methods</h4>We systematically searched 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar) and screened 330 records. Forty-two original studies met the predefined eligibility criteria and were included. Data extraction was guided by 11 thematic research questions. Mechanistic and artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) modeling strategies, data modalities, visualization formats, clinical use cases, reported impacts, limitations, and ethical or legal issues were coded and summarized. Risk of bias was evaluated using a custom checklist for modeling studies, the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) for prediction models, and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for observational studies.<h4>Results</h4>Most digital twins (29/42, 69%) relied on mechanistic models, while hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approaches and purely data-driven designs were less frequent (13/42, 31%). Only 18 studies explicitly described ML or AI, most often deep learning, Bayesian methods, or optimization algorithms. Personalization depended primarily on imaging (32/42, 76%) and electrocardiography or other electrical signals (18/42, 43%). Visualization was dominated (41/42, 98%) by static figures and anatomical snapshots. Clinically, digital twins were most commonly applied to therapy planning, risk prediction, and monitoring. Reported benefits focused on improved decision-making and therapy-related impacts, with occasional (8/42, 19%) reports of increased accuracy or faster diagnosis, but there was limited evidence for downstream improvements in patient outcomes. Key barriers included strong model assumptions and simplifications; high computational cost; data quality and availability constraints; limited external validation; and challenges in real-time performance, workflow integration, and usability. Explicit discussion of ethical, legal, or governance issues was rare (7/42, 17%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Cardiovascular digital twins show substantial potential to advance precision cardiology by linking personalized physiological models with clinical decision support, particularly for therapy planning and risk prediction in arrhythmia and heart failure. However, real-world implementation is constrained by methodological heterogeneity, restricted data and validation practices, limited openness of code and models, and sparse engagement with ethical and governance questions. Future research should prioritize standardized evaluation frameworks, robust clinical validation, interoperable and user-centered system design, and ethically grounded, patient-centered development to realize the full clinical value of digital twin systems.",Sarani Rad F; Bitaraf E; Jafarpour M; Li J,"Computer Science Department, North Dakota State University, 1320 Albrecht Blvd, Fargo, ND, 58105, United States, 1 (701) 231-9662.",JMIR cardio,2026-01-08,10.2196/78499,10.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); machine learning(kw,abstract); clinical decision support(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Simulation; Ethics; Cardiology; Personalized Medicine; Machine Learning; Clinical Decision Support; Digital Twin

This study aims to assess health sciences librarians' data skills based on the conceptual framework developed by Federer and how hteya re able to solve any gaps in knowledge or training. In this cross-sectional survey, we are looking to determine if the health science libraries are adjusting to the demands of medical data preservation and sharing support and to determine whether health sciences librarians perceive there to be a need for increased assistance for these emerging responsibilties. This study will also examine what particular areas need support (i.e. data visualization, data preservation, or supporting an institutional respository).",Chung S; Byun M; Exner N,"Health Sciences Librarian, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.",Medical reference services quarterly,2026-01-06,10.1080/02763869.2025.2602018,9.8,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Data Visualization; data management; Data Preservation; Health Sciences Librarian; Academic Librarianship; Data Librarianship
41494762,Consolidation of health data to improve health data governance using the Multi-Source Data Analytics and Triangulation platform.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This paper explores the implementation of the Multi-Source Data Analytics and Triangulation (MSDAT) platform as a solution to Nigeria's health data challenges. By consolidating data from various sources into a centralised platform, MSDAT aims to improve data accessibility, interoperability and quality.<h4>Methods</h4>The MSDAT platform was developed using a modular, cloud-based architecture comprising data integration and analytics layers. Secondary health data from multiple standard sources such as District Health Information Software 2, Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, WHO. Data was visualised using interactive dashboards.

41512985,Tailoring the Recovery Ruler: A Data Visualization Tool for Disorders of Consciousness Rehabilitation Programs. ,"To describe the process and results of tailoring the Recovery Ruler, a novel data visualization tool for patients in disorders of consciousness at four post-acute rehabilitation programs. Descriptive, participatory, qualitative approach. We conducted iterative design sessions with rehabilitation practitioners to tailor the Recovery Ruler for post-acute care workflows. Four post-acute rehabilitation programs. 16 rehabilitation practitioners. Not applicable. Transcripts from design sessions, research team notes, and correspondences to describe the process of tailoring the Recovery Ruler. Practitioners identified three core functions of the Recovery Ruler: (1) communicating Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) results to family care partners, (2) guiding interpretation of CRS-R scores, and (3) providing context for CRS-R results. Revisions to the tool aligned with these functions, including emphasizing the 0-100 equal-interval scale for clarity, replacing solid lines with dashed lines to represent score ranges, and adding fields for clinical notes and test completion codes. Practitioners perceived that tailoring the Recovery Ruler enhanced comprehensibility, efficiency and alignment with program workflows. The Recovery Ruler was tailored to meet the diverse needs of four post-acute DoC programs, emphasizing person-centered principles of transparency, comprehensibility, and perceptions of holistic communication. Practitioners' input guided revisions to enhance family communication, facilitate CRS-R interpretation, and contextualize patient data, while maintaining adaptability to varied clinical workflows. Future research should focus on extended usability testing and tailored implementation strategies to optimize integration into practice.",Grady-Dominguez P; Teague L; McGuire A; Tran J; O'Brien K; Watters K; Sheau K; Tefertiller C; Hays K; Kot T; Ford P; Mallinson T; Weaver JA,"Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO.",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2026-01-07,10.1016/j.apmr.2025.12.028,7.8,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(title,abstract)",
41489070,Real-Time In Vivo Cellular-Level Imaging During Puncture.,"In the pursuit of precise disease diagnosis, accurate tissue sampling during biopsy is critical. Current CT/ ultrasound-guided biopsies provide macroscopic localization but lack real-time cellular-resolution visualization during puncture, particularly for deep, narrow lumens or small lesions, thereby increasing false-negative and nondiagnostic sampling risks. It's desired to have a puncture with microscopy imaging. Here, we demonstrate an artificial-intelligence-empowered integrative-light-field microendoscopy (AIM) needle. This photonic-mechanically co-engineered probe overcomes dynamic diffraction limits via a closed-loop adaptive optics system integrated in a 25G biopsy needle, enabling diffraction-limited imaging during in vivo puncture. AIM needle resolved characteristic layered microstructures throughout mouse organs (parenchymal/hollow) and pulmonary tumors via synergistic light-field modulation, leveraging K-means and convolutional neural networks to enable in situ pathology-like analysis and tumor/normal tissue discrimination along puncture paths. AIM needle demonstrates dual clinical potential as a complement to macroscopic guidance: potentially providing histology-like feedback without interrupting procedures while enhancing biopsy targeting accuracy through navigation integration, reducing false-negative rates in narrow lumens and microlesions, thereby improving early detection sensitivity.",Gao H; Shao J; Li Q; Tan Y; Huang L; Xu X; Qi J; Xiao J; Li W; Wen Z; Wang L; Liu X; Yang Q; Gu Y,"College of Optical and Electronic Technology, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2026-01-05,10.1002/advs.202515110,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Biopsy Guidance; Cellular Resolution; Microscopic Visualization; False‐negative Rate Reduction; In Vivo Puncture Imaging
41503368,Synthetic multi-inversion time magnetic resonance images for visualization of subcortical structures.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Visualization of subcortical gray matter is essential in neuroscience and clinical practice, particularly for disease understanding and surgical planning. Although multi-inversion time (multi-TI) T1 -weighted ( T1 -w) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging improves visualization, it is only acquired in specific clinical settings and not available in common public MR datasets.<h4>Approach</h4>We present SyMTIC (synthetic multi-TI contrasts), a deep learning method that generates synthetic multi-TI images using routinely acquired T1 -w, T2 -weighted ( T2 -w), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Our approach combines image translation via deep neural networks with imaging physics to estimate longitudinal relaxation time ( T1 ) and proton density ( ρ ) maps. These maps are then used to compute multi-TI images with arbitrary inversion times.<h4>Results</h4>SyMTIC was trained using paired magnetization prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) and fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery (FGATIR) images along with T2 -w and FLAIR images. It accurately synthesized multi-TI images from standard clinical inputs, achieving image quality comparable to that from explicitly acquired multi-TI data. The synthetic images, especially for TI values between 400 to 800 ms, enhanced visualization of subcortical structures and improved segmentation of thalamic nuclei.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SyMTIC enables robust generation of high-quality multi-TI images from routine MR contrasts. When paired with the HACA3 algorithm, it generalizes well to varied clinical datasets, including those without FLAIR or T2 -w images and unknown parameters, offering a practical solution for improving brain MR image visualization and analysis.",Hays SP; Zuo L; Feng A; Liu Y; Dewey BE; Zhuo J; Mowry EM; Newsome SD; Prince JL; Carass A,"Johns Hopkins University, Image Analysis and Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.","Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)",2026-01-06,10.1117/1.jmi.13.1.014002,7.0,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract)",Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Synthesis
41512678,Pilot study: Training bilingual Hmong caregivers using the pain assessment information visualization tool for effective communication in healthcare. ,"Pain in non-English-speaking Hmong patients may be under-detected and under-managed, in part due to challenges in patient-clinician communication. While family caregivers could address this deficiency, they lack symptom recognition and communication training. This study piloted a web-based communication training intervention to help Hmong bilingual caregivers document and communicate their care recipients' pain information to clinicians using the Pain Assessment Information Visualization (InfoViz) tool and communication strategies. We conducted a single-arm, pre-post pilot study of a web-based pain training communication intervention. In the intervention, caregivers use tools and practice communication strategies with video case studies. Qualitative interviews evaluated participants' training experiences, and quantitative measures evaluated feasibility outcomes (satisfaction, time to completion, usability). Descriptive statistics analyzed feasibility outcomes and thematic analysis assessed qualitative feedback about the training. Thirty Hmong caregivers (mean age 32; 26 female) completed the training. They lived in the U.S. for an average of 29 years, with half having a healthcare background (n = 15). Among those who completed the training, 96 % reported being somewhat (n = 8) or extremely satisfied (n = 21) with the intervention. The average completion time was 56 min, primarily using a laptop. Caregivers reported learning new ways to describe pain in Hmong, valued tools for preparation, and felt empowered to support communication during medical visits. Our intervention was feasible and acceptable, providing valuable tools and strategies to help Hmong caregivers support their loved ones with pain communication during medical visits. Future research should examine the intervention's effectiveness and its impact on clinical outcomes. Providing Hmong caregivers with communication training could help overcome language and cultural barriers during pain-related primary care visits for non-English-speaking patients. Additional studies are needed to determine how such training can be integrated into clinical workflows and scaled for broader use.",Lor M; Chewning B; Wu L,"University of Wisconsin-Madison, School of Nursing, Madison, WI, USA.

A scoring system assessed the delineation of 28 anatomical structures, narrowed to eight for detailed evaluation. Protocols 14s I and 8s I achieved the highest image quality, exceeding the clinical threshold. 8s I protocol demonstrated an optimal balance between image quality and radiation safety, adhering to the ALADA principle (""as low as diagnostically acceptable""). While 14s I offered superior detail, it involved higher radiation exposure without substantial further image improvement, indicating a saturation effect. Shorter protocols, such as 4s I, offered radiation-sparing advantages but did not consistently meet clinical image quality standards.

Understanding biofilm formation is crucial for developing control and eradication strategies. In response to environmental cues, planktonic bacteria adopt a sessile lifestyle, coordinating growth with matrix production. We monitored cellulose biofilm formation by Pseudomonas sp. IsoF in real time using single-step fluorescent stains. Live-tracking of polysaccharide synthesis revealed dynamic matrix arrangements shaping final biofilm structure. Cellulose determined substratum adherence, cell contacts, and colony patterning in IsoF. Biofilms formed in flow-cells and at air-liquid interfaces were remarkably similar in composition, progression, and architecture. Artificial elevation of intracellular c-di-GMP levels produced cellulose-dependent biofilms distinct from the wild type and induced a secondary exopolysaccharide.

41505743,Developing an AI-Assisted Tool That Identifies Patients With Multimorbidity and Complex Polypharmacy to Improve the Process of Medication Reviews: Qualitative Interview and Focus Group Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Structured medication reviews (SMRs) are an essential component of medication optimization, especially for patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. However, the process remains challenging due to the complexities of patient data, time constraints, and the need for coordination among health care professionals (HCPs). This study explores HCPs' perspectives on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted tools to enhance the SMR process, with a focus on the potential benefits of and barriers to adoption.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to identify the key user requirements for AI-assisted tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of SMRs, specifically for patients with multimorbidity, complex polypharmacy, and frailty.<h4>Methods</h4>A qualitative study was conducted involving focus groups and semistructured interviews with HCPs and patients in the United Kingdom. Participants included physicians, pharmacists, clinical pharmacologists, psychiatrists from primary and secondary care, a policy maker, and patients with multimorbidity. Data were analyzed using a hybrid inductive and deductive thematic analysis approach to identify themes related to AI-assisted tool functionality, workflow integration, user-interface visualization, and usability in the SMR process.<h4>Results</h4>Four major themes emerged from the analysis: innovative AI potential, optimizing electronic patient record visualization, functionality of the AI tool for SMRs, and facilitators of and barriers to AI tool implementation. HCPs identified the potential of AI to support patient identification and prioritizing those at risk of medication-related harm. AI-assisted tools were viewed as essential in detecting prescribing gaps, drug interactions, and patient risk trajectories over time. Participants emphasized the importance of presenting patient data in an intuitive format, with a patient interface for shared decision-making. Suggestions included color-coding blood results, highlighting critical medication reviews, and providing timelines of patient medical histories. HCPs stressed the need for AI tools to integrate seamlessly with existing electronic patient record systems and provide actionable insights without overwhelming users with excessive notifications or ""pop-up"" alerts. Factors influencing the uptake of AI-assisted tools included the need for user-friendly design, evidence of tool effectiveness (though some were skeptical about the predictive accuracy of AI models), and addressing concerns around digital exclusion.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings highlight the potential for AI-assisted tools to streamline and optimize the SMR process, particularly for patients with multimorbidity and complex polypharmacy. However, successful implementation depends on addressing concerns related to workflow integration, user acceptance, and evidence of effectiveness. User-centered design is crucial to ensure that AI-assisted tools support HCPs in delivering high-quality, patient-centered care while minimizing cognitive overload and alert fatigue.",Abuzour AS; Wilson SA; Woodall AA; Mair FS; Aslam A; Clegg A; Shantsila E; Gabbay M; Abaho M; Bollegala D; Cant H; Griffiths A; Hama L; Leeming G; Lo E; Maskell S; O'Connell M; Popoola O; Relton S; Ruddle RA; Schofield P; Sperrin M; Van Staa T; Buchan I; Walker LE,"Academic Unit for Ageing & Stroke Research, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.",Journal of medical Internet research,2026-01-08,10.2196/74304,6.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; AI; Risk stratification; Health Technology; Medicine Optimization; Structured Medication Reviews

41511856,Artificial Intelligence in Diabetic Kidney Disease Research: Bibliometric Analysis From 2006 to 2024. ,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major complication of diabetes and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease globally. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have shown increasing potential in DKD research for early detection, risk prediction, and disease management. However, the landscape of AI applications in this field remains incompletely mapped, especially in terms of collaboration networks, thematic evolution, and clinical translation. This study aims to perform a comprehensive bibliometric and translational analysis of AI-related DKD research published between 2006 and 2024, identifying publication trends, research hotspots, key contributors, collaboration patterns, and the extent of clinical validation and explainability. A systematic search of the Web of Science Core Collection was conducted to identify English-language original articles applying AI technologies to DKD. Articles were screened following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Bibliometric visualization was performed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer to assess coauthorship, institutional and country collaboration, keyword evolution, and citation bursts. A qualitative review was conducted to evaluate clinical validation, model explainability, and real-world implementation. Out of 1158 retrieved records, 384 studies met the inclusion criteria. Global publications on AI in DKD increased rapidly after 2019. China led in publication volume, followed by the United States, India, and Iran. Keyword analysis showed a thematic transition from early biomarker and proteomic research to deep learning, clinical prediction models, and management tools. Despite methodological advances, few studies included external validation or explainability frameworks. Notable translational efforts included DeepMind's acute kidney injury predictor and a chronic kidney disease prediction model developed by Sumit, yet widespread real-world integration remains limited. AI research in DKD has grown substantially over the past 2 decades, with expanding international collaboration and diversification of research themes.

40639971,Visualization of Nerve Pathology and Correlation with Clinical Severity in Bell Palsy Using 3D Double-Echo Steady-State with Water Excitation Sequence.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Bell palsy (BP) is the most common cause of facial nerve (FN) palsy. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic ability of the 3D double-echo steady-state with water excitation (3D-DESS-WE) sequence to visualize pathologic changes in the FN of patients with BP.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with BP who underwent 3T MRI including 3D-DESS-WE within 30 days of onset and 60 sex- and age (SD, 2) matched controls. Qualitative evaluation of FN signal intensity (SI<sub>FN</sub>) and thickness (TH<sub>FN</sub>) was performed using a 3-point scale. Quantitative metrics included SI<sub>FN</sub> and TH<sub>FN</sub> measurements and affected-to-unaffected signal intensity and thickness ratios (SR<sub>A/U</sub> and TR<sub>A/U</sub>) in the BP group, and right-to-left ratios in controls. Interobserver agreement, group comparisons, correlations with clinical severity (Yanagihara score), and diagnostic performance were assessed. In a subset of 17 matched pairs, the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced (CE) T1WI was assessed, and its agreement with 3D-DESS-WE-based qualitative assessment was evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Qualitative scores for SI<sub>FN</sub> and TH<sub>FN</sub> were significantly higher in the BP group than in controls (<i>P</i> < .001), with high interobserver agreement (κ = 0.810, 0.788, respectively). When dichotomized (score 0 versus 1-2), qualitative assessments showed good diagnostic performance with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.82 for SI<sub>FN</sub>, and 0.90 and 0.80 for TH<sub>FN,</sub> respectively. Neither qualitative score correlated significantly with clinical severity. Agreement between 3D-DESS-WE-based and CE T1WI-based qualitative assessments was substantial to almost perfect (κ = 0.766-0.882). In quantitative analysis, both SI<sub>FN</sub> and TH<sub>FN</sub> were significantly higher on the affected side in the BP group (<i>P</i> < .001), whereas no significant lateral differences were observed in controls. Although SI<sub>FN</sub>, TH<sub>FN</sub>, and SR<sub>A/U</sub> did not correlate significantly with clinical severity, TR<sub>A/U</sub> was significantly inversely correlated with the Yanagihara score (<i>r</i> = -0.413, <i>P</i> = .02), which corresponds to a positive correlation with clinical severity. The Yanagihara score was the only independent predictor of TR<sub>A/U</sub> in multiple regression analysis (β = -0.425, <i>P</i> = .04). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed high diagnostic performance: area under the curve = 0.908 for SR<sub>A/U</sub> and 0.927 for TR<sub>A/U</sub>.<h4>Conclusions</h4>3D-DESS-WE may be a valuable tool for the routine clinical assessment of BP.",Fujii H; Kikuchi T; Fujii N; Chiba E; Masuoka S; Nakamata A; Hamamoto K; Matsuki M; Mori H,"From the Department of Radiology, Jichi Medical University, School of Medicine, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan hiroyuki.fujii@jichi.ac.jp.",AJNR.

41500443,AI-driven gingival segmentation on CBCT: validation using delineation by intraoral scanning and CBCT-based cotton roll separation.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To validate a novel AI approach for automated gingival segmentation directly from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans acquired with cotton roll separation.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred and eighty arches (101 CBCT) were split into: ground truth (90 arches), internal validation [AI vs manual segmentation (MS); 30 arches], and clinical validation [AI vs expert refinement (R-AI); 60 arches]. Ground truth consisted of manually segmented gingival models from CBCT with cotton roll separation, using intraoral scan outlines as references. AI gingival segmentation was generated from CBCT acquired with cotton roll separation, uploaded to a cloud-based platform (Virtual Patient Creator, Relu, Belgium). R-AI was performed by refining the AI segmentation according to CBCT outlines. The performance was evaluated using voxel-wise and surface-based comparisons. Additionally, time efficiency and consistency were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>AI gingiva achieved high overlap with MS, with Dice score (DSC) of 80±4% and minor surface discrepancies, with median surface distance (MSD) of 0.02±0.09 mm. Similarly, DSC between AI and R-AI was high (91±4%), and MSD was small (0.07±0.07 mm). Significant differences between arches were found in AI vs R-AI; however, these differences were not clinically relevant (∆DSC∼2%, ∆MSD∼0.00 mm, p<0.05). Evaluator consistency was high, whereas AI achieved perfect reproducibility and significantly increased time efficiency (6.7 s) compared to R-AI (1090 s) and MS (4344 s), p<0.001.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The presently validated cloud-based AI model achieved fast, accurate, and consistent gingiva segmentation from CBCTs comparable to expert-level performance using CBCT-based cotton roll separation with delineation by intraoral scanning as a clinical reference.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>Automated 3D gingival models may assist efficient diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome visualization in esthetic dentistry, orthodontic treatment planning, and periodontal assessment.

41343867,A pretrained foundation model for headache disorders based on magnetoencephalography.,"<i>Objective.</i>Foundation models have demonstrated transformative potential in medical artificial intelligence but remain underexplored in functional neuroimaging, particularly magnetoencephalography (MEG). This study aims to develop a domain-specific, self-supervised MEG clinical foundation model tailored for headache disorders to address the challenges of high-dimensional data and limited labeled datasets in clinical research.<i>Approach</i>. We developed a transformer-based model pretrained on a large-scale dataset comprising multi-state MEG recordings (resting-state, auditory, and somatosensory stimulation) from 416 participants (362 headache patients and 54 healthy controls). The model utilized a self-supervised masked-signal reconstruction strategy to learn latent spatiotemporal representations of neural activity. We evaluated the model's performance through signal reconstruction, visualization of attention weights, and downstream classification tasks comparing model-derived features against original MEG signals for migraine diagnosis.<i>Main results</i>. The pretrained model successfully reconstructed both continuous MEG signals and stimulus-specific evoked responses, effectively capturing intrinsic spatiotemporal brain dynamics. Visualization of the model's attention weights demonstrated spatial alignment with corresponding sensory brain regions, confirming its neurophysiological interpretability.

Accurate staging of KCN using corneal topographic maps is critical for timely diagnosis and effective treatment planning.<h4>Methods</h4>This study proposes an enhanced deep learning framework for KCN stage classification based on corneal topographic images. The model employs a Dual Vision Transformer (DViT) to effectively capture both local and global spatial features. To optimize model performance, the Electric Eel Foraging Optimizer (EEFO) is utilized for tuning attention weights and hyperparameters of the DViT architecture. Additionally, model interpretability is enhanced through Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), enabling visualization of corneal regions influencing classification decisions.<h4>Results</h4>Experimental evaluations conducted on a keratoconus dataset demonstrate that the proposed DViT-EEFO model outperforms existing approaches, achieving an accuracy of 99.2%, recall of 99.3%, and precision of 99.5%. Interpretability analyses confirm that the model focuses on clinically relevant corneal regions during decision-making.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed DViT-EEFO framework delivers high classification performance and improved interpretability, highlighting its strong potential as a reliable clinical decision support tool for early keratoconus diagnosis and treatment planning.",Raghavan P; Balasubramanian C; Jarin T,"Department of CSE, P.S.R.

41505706,"Assessment of injury severity and recovery trajectories in urban motorcycle crashes: An analysis of hospital data from Dhaka, Bangladesh.","<h4>Objective</h4>Motorcycle crashes, one of the major contributors to worldwide road traffic crashes (RTCs), remain a critical public health issue often in several low- and middle-income countries, where data limitations hinder comprehensive safety assessments. Existing studies have largely relied on police-reported data, which often underrepresents crash severity and lacks detail on post-crash recovery. To address the gap, this study aims to utilize hospital-based data for examining the distribution of patients across demographic, vehicular, situational and crash dynamics related factors; and to provide a severity-based assessment across several variables, such as patient's age, impact speed, collision type, and impacted body region. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate severity-based post-crash outcomes, focusing on patient's 30-day recovery status.<h4>Methods</h4>The study used a questionnaire-based interview to collect data from 509 motorcycle crash victims admitted in two major hospitals, over a nine-month period in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was employed to provide a standardized assessment of injury severity, while the data summarization and visualization was achieved using R software package.<h4>Results</h4>Findings reveal a high frequency of motorcycle crashes among males in the 11-40 age bracket, middle-income individuals, and students or service-holders, with most incidents occurring at moderate speeds and head-on collisions on single-lane roads. Severity-based analysis highlights that injuries in AIS 2 (moderate) and 3 (serious) are predominant, with a trend of increasing proportion of injuries with severity of AIS 3 or above correlated with older age groups, high-speed crashes, and specific collision types like rear-end and head-on. Lower extremity, specially the legs, are the most susceptible body part to injuries across all severity categories. Moreover, recovery rates (proportion of injured patients who fully or partially recover from their injuries after 30-days) decrease with higher injury severity, with permanent disabilities being more common among severely injured patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The data distribution reveals how crash frequency, and severity varies across several key factors while also divulging how injury severity impacts recovery trajectories. The results are expected to provide a foundation for future research and policy development toward reducing motorcycle crash risks and improving post-crash recoveries in similar urban settings.",Ahmed N; Tasnim J; Hossain M; Aftab KA; Kabir AKMF; Aktar F; Rahman AZMM; Nasim M,"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Islamic University of Technology, Gazipur, Bangladesh.",Traffic injury prevention,2026-01-08,10.1080/15389588.2025.2596843,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",Injury Severity; Abbreviated Injury Scale; Motorcycle Crash; Recovery Trajectory; Transportation In Developing Countries
41512109,Computer-aided characterization of the arrhythmogenic substrate after myocardial infarction. ,"Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) remain major contributors to sudden cardiac death, with current therapies limited by our incomplete understanding of the arrhythmogenic substrate. This narrative review explores recent developments in computer-aided techniques for characterizing the arrhythmogenic substrate, focusing on post-myocardial infarction VT. High-resolution cardiac imaging now enables detailed visualization of structural abnormalities, including heterogeneous scar architecture and fatty infiltration. Sophisticated invasive mapping techniques provide insights into local electrophysiological properties, while novel noninvasive mapping approaches offer complementary views of global electrical patterns. Integration of these modalities through computational simulations allows for mechanistic insights into arrhythmia initiation and maintenance, particularly in post-myocardial infarction VT where structural and functional substrates interact in complex ways. Emerging artificial intelligence applications enhance substrate analysis through automated feature extraction and pattern recognition, enabling more sophisticated risk stratification. These computer-aided approaches are advancing from research tools to clinical applications, with early evidence suggesting improved ablation outcomes and better risk prediction. However, significant challenges remain in validation, standardization, and clinical implementation of these innovations.

41514050,Deployment of a cloud-based passive defecation monitoring system for continuous gut health monitoring. ,"With the growing demand for accurate yet effortless health monitoring at home, most current approaches to stool analysis rely on self-reported diaries that are prone to recall bias and low adherence. Here we present a fully passive alternative: the Precision Health Integrated Diagnostic (PHIND) system, a smart-toilet-based platform that enables automated defecation monitoring without requiring users to alter their daily routines. By integrating optical and pressure sensors with cloud-based convolutional neural networks, the PHIND system classifies stool form according to the Bristol Stool Form Scale and records key defecatory parameters, including total event time, defecation duration and time to first stool drop. The protocol proceeds in three principal stages: (1) assembling and mounting the hardware onto a conventional toilet; (2) training convolutional neural network models for stool classification and event detection; and (3) image acquisition and deploying cloud infrastructure for real-time analysis, data storage and visualization. Compared with traditional methods that depend on user-reported stool diaries, PHIND provides objective, near real-time data free from recall error, enabling more reliable early detection and long-term management of gastrointestinal conditions. Researchers and clinicians can expect high classification accuracy and robust, longitudinal insights into defecation patterns. The complete protocol-from hardware setup to system validation-can typically be completed within 2 d, excluding printed circuit board manufacturing, which generally requires up to 15 d depending on the manufacturing provider.",Song Z; Kim M; Lee J; Kwon TH; Kim J; Kim JH; Kim SG; Kim S; Jun BH; Lee SH; Park WG; Sonu I; Rosen MJ; Ong CW; Shen X; Ng LWT; Kim G; Chae SH; Siah KTH; Ho D; Song SW; Martinez-Martin N; Song J; Yew KC; Kim M; Huang HW; Wong SH; Lee BJ; Park SM,"School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.",Nature protocols,2026-01-09,10.1038/s41596-025-01296-9,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

","This study aimed to elucidate the utility of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for lateral oropharyngectomy in patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) by comparing its treatment outcomes with those of conventional non-robotic procedures. The clinical charts of patients with newly diagnosed p16-positive OPSCC from the lateral wall who underwent lateral oropharyngectomy at our institution between 2016 and 2025 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups according to the surgical approach: the non-robotic procedure group, treated via direct visualization or transoral videolaryngoscopic surgery, and the TORS group, treated using the da Vinci Surgical System. Clinicopathological data were compared between the groups. This study included 105 patients, 80 of whom underwent non-robotic procedures, and 25 underwent TORS. The TORS group exhibited a significantly lower rate of positive surgical margins (36% vs. 4%, P < .001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that TORS is an independent predictor of negative margins (odds ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.70; P = .02).

41495415,Enhanced colorectal gland segmentation through multi-scale attention and contextual feature fusion.,"Histological image segmentation of colorectal cancer plays a crucial role in reliable cancer grading, prognosis evaluation, and treatment planning. Nevertheless, existing automated approaches often struggle due to fine-grained glandular structures, staining variations, acquisition differences across scanners and highly heterogeneous tissue morphology. To address these challenges, we propose MAC-Net, an enhanced deep learning model that integrates multi-scale feature fusion with attention-guided contextual decoding to achieve precise gland segmentation across diverse tumor differentiation stages. MAC-Net retains fine structural information by channel-wise attention, enhances learning of discriminative features by the increased number of enriched encoder-decoder lateral connections, and the global contextual information, by means of multi-scale spatial pooling at the bottleneck. To determine the generalizability of the model, we trained the model on the EBHI-Seg data (2228 images) and cross-validated it on the GIaS data (165 images). MAC-Net achieved 95.08% Dice, 90.92% IoU, 95.83% Precision, and 95.65% Recall, outperforming existing architectures. Furthermore, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping visualization and uncertainty analysis enhance interpretability, provides deeper insight on model's transparent behavior and supports reliable clinical decision-making in the field of digital pathology.",B K P; N L; Ajibesin AA,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amrita School of Computing, Coimbatore, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, India.",Scientific reports,2026-01-07,10.1038/s41598-025-34548-5,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Deep Learning; Explainable Ai; Hybrid Loss; Histopathological Segmentation; Colorectal Cancer Segmentation
41364977,Band-limited implicit neural representations for diffusion-weighted imaging denoising.,"<i>Purpose.</i>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has significant value in disease diagnosis and treatment response monitoring, but its inherent low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) severely affects image quality and quantification accuracy. Existing denoising techniques often blur important tissue boundary information when suppressing noise.<i>Methods.</i>This study proposes a band-limited implicit neural representation (BL-INR) framework for DWI denoising. The method introduces BL positional encoding based on the frequency response characteristics of the sinc function to restrict INR models from learning high-frequency noise while maintaining strong signal representation capabilities. Furthermore, multi-<i>b</i>-value DWI and structural MRI from the same patient are integrated as anatomical priors, exploiting the correlation between true signals and the statistical independence of noise to achieve effective denoising.<i>Main Results.</i>In clinical DWI data evaluation across four anatomical regions (brain, head and neck, abdomen, and pelvis), BL-INR's visualization results were superior to existing methods. Under extremely low SNR conditions (SNR = 1) in simulated noise experiments, BL-INR achieved a peak SNR of 35.44 and structural similarity index of 0.933, significantly outperforming other methods. Phantom denoising results showed that BL-INR achieved an average apparent diffusion coefficient value error of only4.57×10-5 mm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, the smallest among all methods.<i>Significance.</i>BL-INR provides a novel approach for DWI denoising by limiting the frequency of INR input positional encoding. Its self-supervised learning characteristics require no paired training data and allow convenient clinical application. The method enables the derivation of accurate diffusion parameters, providing a reliable foundation for DWI-based quantitative analysis with significant clinical application value.",Li Y; Dai Y; Liao YP; Deng J; Zhang Y,"Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States of America.",Physics in medicine and biology,2026-01-08,10.1088/1361-6560/ae2a9e,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Denoising; Diffusion-weighted Imaging; Self-supervised Learning; Implicit Neural Representation
41491968,Downregulation of USP39 in sepsis reflects immune dysfunction and offers diagnostic and prognostic value.,"<h4>Background</h4>USP39 is involved in mRNA splicing and stress responses. This study analyzed USP39 expression and its clinical relevance in sepsis, aiming to provide a novel treatment target for sepsis.<h4>Methods</h4>The RNA-seq datasets were used for analyzing the expression profile and clinical significance of USP39 in both sepsis and control groups. Functional pathway enrichment was performed using GSEA and GSVA with the clusterProfiler package (3.14.3). Immune infiltration was evaluated via single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA). The prognostic value of USP39 was assessed utilizing Cox regression, and its diagnostic performance was determined via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis employing the survival (3.5.7) and pROC (1.18.5) packages, respectively. For single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data (GSE175453), we performed quality control, normalization, principal component analysis (PCA), batch correction, clustering, and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization employing the Seurat 4.4.0 package. THP-1 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic septic injury. USP39 was overexpressed via pcDNA3.1 transfection. Cellular assays were conducted to measure cell viability, apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α).<h4>Results</h4>Our study found that USP39 was significantly downregulated in sepsis patients and was associated with age, diabetes, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-acquired infections. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that high USP39 expression was linked to metabolic processes, primary immunodeficiency, and spliceosome, and immune response and inflammation pathway. In addition, USP39 also exhibited a high diagnostic value and was identified as an independent prognostic marker in sepsis. ssGSEA revealed higher infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, activated B cells, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the high USP39 expression group, while Th17 and NK cells were more abundant in the low USP39 expression group. According to the results of scRNA-seq analysis, USP39 exhibited significant differential expressions in monocytes and T cells, with low expression observed in sepsis. Furthermore, in vitro experiments confirmed that overexpression of USP39 significantly enhanced cell viability and suppressed apoptosis in LPS-induced THP-1 cells while also inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The significant downregulation of USP39 was correlated with both clinical features and immune infiltration in sepsis, highlighting its role in immune regulation and its potential as a prognostic biomarker.",Liu Z; Chen J; Wu H; Li X; Song C,"Department of Emergency Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Putian University, Putian, 351100, China.",European journal of medical research,2026-01-05,10.1186/s40001-025-03709-7,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Sepsis; Immune Infiltration; Pathway Activation; Usp39; Single-cell Landscape
41495456,MRI-to-PET synthesis via deep learning for amyloid-β quantification in Alzheimer's disease.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Amyloid-β (Aβ) PET is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its high cost and radiation exposure limit its use. Deep learning techniques make it possible to generate PET from structured MRI data. In this study, we built a deep learning model to generate 3D synthetic Aβ PET images from structural MRI.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The generative adversarial network with share parameters (ShareGAN) model was trained and tested with 1009 Aβ PET and paired MRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database and three tertiary hospitals in China. The 3D synthetic model operates on the whole volume rather than 2D image slices, realistically reproducing minor discrepancies between neighboring image planes. ShareGAN-based PET images were evaluated using quantitative metrics and visual assessment. Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess the correlation and concordance between synthetic and real PETs.<h4>Results</h4>3D Synthetic PET images showed high similarity and correlation with real Aβ PET in external testing sets 1 and 2 in terms of structural similarity index measure (0.898, 0.899), peak signal-to-noise ratio (34.690, 34.725), mean absolute error (0.031, 0.031), and standardized uptake value ratio (R = 0.758, 0.828). The diagnostic accuracy of PET positive or negative status in external testing sets 1 and 2 was 88.5% and 89.4%, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MRI-based 3D synthetic Aβ PET images can serve as a safe and cost-effective tool for Aβ status visualization, providing PET-eligible patients with Aβ PET-like imaging analysis to guide subsequent real Aβ PET scans.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Amyloid-β (Aβ) PET limitations (high cost, radiation, limited access) hinder early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection. Clinical practice urgently requires a suitable supplementary method for Aβ pathology assessment. Findings AI-synthesized 3D Synthetic Aβ PET from structural MRI demonstrated strong consistency with real PET and effectively triaged high-risk patients for confirmatory scans.

41514132,Application of indocyanine green fluorescence for hilar bile duct identification and management in laparoscopic hemi-hepatectomy (with video). ,"Laparoscopic hemi-hepatectomy using the individual transection method (ITM) for tumors with hilar involvement is technically challenging due to the complex biliary anatomy. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence cholangiography has the potential to improve intraoperative bile duct visualization; however, its clinical value in this setting has not been well established. We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients who underwent laparoscopic hemi-hepatectomy between July 2020 and September 2024. The Glissonean pedicle method (GPM) was used when secondary Glissonean branches were not involved, while the ITM was selected for tumors involving their confluence. ICG fluorescence cholangiography was employed in all cases treated with the ITM. Surgical outcomes and bile duct visualization were assessed using a three-grade Bile Duct Visualization Score (BDVS). Thirteen patients underwent laparoscopic hemi-hepatectomy using the ITM with ICG guidance. The median operative time in the ITM group was longer in comparison to the GPM group (425 vs. 334 min, p = 0.026), while the median blood loss was similar between the groups (101 vs. 174 mL, p = 0.968). Right hemi-hepatectomy was more frequently performed in the ITM group (n = 8 vs. n = 4), whereas left hemi-hepatectomy was predominant in the GPM group (n = 5 vs. n = 14; p = 0.027). According to the BDVS, 77% of ITM cases were classified as ""clearly visible"" (score 2). R0 resection was achieved in all cases. One case each of biliary stenosis and postoperative bile fistula was observed in the ITM group, both were managed non-surgically. No 90-day mortality occurred. ICG fluorescence cholangiography enabled reliable visualization of the hilar bile ducts and contributed to safe bile duct management in laparoscopic hemi-hepatectomy requiring application of the ITM.

41506266,In vivo detection of immune responses via cytokine activity labeling.,"While much is known about the identity and regulation of cytokine-producing cells, the cell types that respond to cytokines remain largely uncharacterized. To address this knowledge gap, we developed ""cytokine cellular locating platforms"" (CyCLoPs), a reporter system that translates cytokine receptor engagement into a genetically traceable signal. In vitro, CyCLoPs demonstrated high specificity, robust signal-to-background ratios, and broad applicability for probing diverse cytokine receptor interactions. In vivo, interleukin (IL)-17A-CyCLoPs reporter mice enabled the identification of IL-17A-responsive intestinal epithelial cells predominantly localized in the ileal villi following commensal bacterial colonization. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-CyCLoPs reporter mice allowed for the detection of IFN-γ-exposed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within tumors, which expressed CD36, CD38, and leptin receptor and displayed gene signatures associated with reduced effector function. Collectively, CyCLoPs offers a platform for the direct visualization and characterization of cytokine-induced cellular responses and provides a tool for investigating how cytokines orchestrate distinct immunological outcomes in health and disease.",Lu G; Zhang S; Feng M; Kim E; Cho D; Kim JH; Caris H; Silberstein L; Choi GB; Huh JR,"Department of Immunology, Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.",Cell,2026-01-07,10.1016/j.cell.2025.12.011,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Intestinal epithelial cell; Cytokine receptor; IFN-γ; Iec; Il-17a; Cd8(+) T Cell
41503551,A Preliminary Exploratory Study on the Application of Gd-EOB-DTPA-Enhanced MRI for Assessing Gallbladder Ejection Fraction in Cholecystolithiasis Patients.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To preliminarily explore the feasibility and clinical implications of using gadoxetic acid disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing the gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) in patients with cholecystolithiasis.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective analysis encompassed 81 patients with gallstones who underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Gallbladder volume was measured during fasting and at 1 h after a lipid-rich meal to calculate the GBEF. Two radiologists independently reviewed the images for GBEF, structural anomalies, and biliary patency.<h4>Results</h4>The mean GBEF was 62.29% ± 25.2%. Sixty patients demonstrated a GBEF > 50%, while 21 had a GBEF ≤ 50%. The imaging also facilitated the identification of gallbladder malformations (41/81) and abnormal pancreaticobiliary junctions (20/81). Bile flow into the gallbladder via the cystic duct and into the duodenum was observed in 66 patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This exploratory study suggests that Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI is a feasible modality for simultaneous anatomical evaluation and functional assessment of the GBEF in cholecystolithiasis patients. It provides a comprehensive visualization of biliary dynamics. However, the findings are preliminary, and further validation against standard modalities with controlled study design is required to establish its accuracy and clinical utility.",Zhang R; Chen B; Li X; Zheng X; Liu Y; Zhang R; Zeng Q; Tian H; He Q; Wu S; Gao Y; Li Z; Lyu H; Liu J,"The First Department of Surgery, Shenzhen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, The Fourth Clinical Medical College of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, gzucm.edu.cn.",Canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,2026-01-06,10.1155/cjgh/8851215,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cholecystolithiasis; Gd-eob-dtpa-enhanced Mri; Gallbladder Contractile Function
41498309,Optical coherence tomography angiography features of inflammatory choroidal neovascularizaton in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To describe optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) features of inflammatory choroidal neovascular membrane (iCNV) in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a retrospective review of the medical records of patients with iCNV in VKH disease, documented on OCTA, seen by a single uveitis specialist from a tertiary care eye hospital. Each patient had a detailed medical record of the clinical features and underwent swept-source OCTA (SS-OCTA) analyzed by a retina specialist and a uveitis specialist.<h4>Results</h4>Analysis of the 11 eyes of 8 patients who had iCNV and SS-OCTA documentation showed that peripapillary iCNV was the most common. Distinct iCNV patterns noted were filamentous, sea fan, medusa head, and pruned along with flow voids of choroidal granulomas in the active inflammatory stage of the disease. Reduction of the flow signals in iCNV, on OCTA, indicated a response to treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>OCTA is a valuable tool in visualization and classification of choroidal neovascularizations and their response to treatment in inflammatory conditions like VKH disease.",Rao V; Biswas J; Rao C; Hashim M; Boro M,"Uveitis Service, Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",Indian journal of ophthalmology,2026-01-07,10.4103/ijo.ijo_1812_25,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Anti-vegf; Vogt–koyanagi–harada Disease; Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography; Choroidal Neovacularization
41492784,Phase-Manipulated Calcium Borate-Based Multicolor Mechanoluminescence.,"Multicolor mechanoluminescence (ML) materials have attracted growing attention for applications in anti-counterfeiting, smart skin, wearable electronics, and structural health monitoring. However, their widespread implementation remains significantly hindered by the scarce available compositions and harsh preparation conditions-typically requiring temperatures above 1000°C and protective atmospheres. Here, a facile, low-temperature, and atmosphere-free synthesis of calcium borate-based ML materials (Ca<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and CaB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) is achieved. The phase ratio of Ca<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and CaB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is manipulated by adjusting the stoichiometric ratio of raw materials (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> and CaO). The distinct tetrahedral and octahedral coordination of Mn<sup>2+</sup> in these phases gives rise to tunable ML emission spanning from green to orange (535-605 nm). When incorporated into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers, these materials exhibit remarkable multicolor ML suitable for multi-level optical encryption and motion visualization. The encrypted information remains hidden under daylight or UV illumination can be deciphered only through ML activation, while the stress-induced color variation enables real-time monitoring of joint movement. This work not only establishes a versatile route for the design of low-temperature, phase-tunable ML materials but also reveals promising applications in next-generation information security and intelligent motion-sensing technologies.",Meng J; Sun J; Zhang W; Jiao F; Han Y; Tao Q; Kan K; Li X; Hua Q; Peng D; Shan CX; Dong L,"Henan Key Laboratory of Diamond Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Key Laboratory of Materials Physics, Ministry of Education, School of Physics, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2026-01-06,10.1002/adma.202522179,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Motion Monitoring; Calcium Borate; Anti‐counterfeiting; Multicolor Mechanoluminescence; Phase‐manipulated
41497547,Robot-assisted Axillary Lymph Node Dissection for Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer.,"Current experience with robotic-assisted axillary lymph node dissection (R-ALND) is limited. Axillary lymph node dissection is essential for patients with pathological N2-3 disease, but conventional open surgery carries a risk of injury to the intercostobrachial nerve, leading to sensory deficits, pain, and reduced quality of life. R-ALND may enhance precision through minimally invasive techniques, potentially reducing complications. Patients with breast cancer who underwent R-ALND at our institution between March 2024 and March 2025 were enrolled and analyzed. The procedure used the da Vinci system, following a systematic ""bottom-up, back-to-front"" sequence for axillary dissection, with emphasis on preserving the intercostobrachial nerve and blood vessels. The clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, complications, and recurrence of R-ALND were analyzed. The mean operative time was 48.16 ± 9.65 minutes, with a median blood loss of 3.00 (2.00, 5.00) mL. A median of 18.00 (13.00, 22.00) lymph nodes were dissected, of which a median of 1.00 (1.00, 4.00) was metastatic. During a mean follow-up period of 8.70 ± 3.24 months, no cases of hemorrhage, infection, seroma, lymphorrhagia, upper limb lymphedema, or recurrence occurred. R-ALND is a safe and precise technique for axillary lymph node dissection, significantly reducing perioperative complications. Its technical advantages include 3-dimensional visualization and enhanced instrument maneuverability, although further validation of long-term survival benefits is required.",Liu Q; Li Z; Wu Y; Chen Z; Fu X; Huang Z; Wu L; Wei L; Li H,"From the Department of General Surgery (Breast Surgery), The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

41489865,Effects of a cystic artery-first Calot's triangle laparoscopic approach versus conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy on therapeutic efficacy and complications in acute cholecystitis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a common biliary disorder, most often caused by gallstones obstructing the cystic duct and leading to gallbladder inflammation.<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy and complication rates of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) performed using the Calot's triangle approach vs traditional LC techniques in the treatment of AC.<h4>Material and methods</h4>A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 patients diagnosed with AC, with 60 patients undergoing LC using the Calot's triangle approach (study group) and 60 patients treated with traditional LC techniques (control group). Surgical parameters, including operation time, intraoperative hemorrhage, postoperative recovery times, and 30-day postoperative complications were recorded. Intraoperative adhesion formation was evaluated through direct visualization and graded based on severity. Postoperative pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS).<h4>Results</h4>There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups, confirming their comparability. The study group (Calot's triangle approach) demonstrated significantly shorter average operation time, postoperative exhaust time, and diet recovery time compared to the control group. Additionally, patients in the study group had significantly lower intraoperative bleeding, lower VAS pain scores at 24 h and 72 h postoperatively, and a lower overall complication rate compared to the control group (p < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The LC Calot's triangle approach demonstrated shorter operation times and lower rates of certain complications compared with traditional LC techniques. However, the absence of statistically significant differences in some key outcomes highlights the need for further research to fully evaluate its clinical advantages and long-term benefits.",Wu Q; Fang Y; Wang L; Wu H; Yang LZ,"Department of Emergency Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Wuhu, China.",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,2026-01-05,10.17219/acem/203217,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy; acute cholecystitis; Calot’s Triangle Approach
40592541,7T TOF-MRA in Adolescents.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>The increased SNR at 7T enables higher spatial resolution for neurovascular imaging, yet its application in pediatric MRA remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates the advantages of 7T TOF-MRA compared with 3T in pediatric patients, hypothesizing that 7T would provide superior vessel contrast and increased vascular volume, given the use of smaller voxels, as well as higher SNR, despite these smaller voxels.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant, institutional review board-approved retrospective study included pediatric patients (younger than 19 years of age) who underwent 7T TOF-MRA. Controls consisted of either same-subject 3T MRAs within 6 months (when available) or age- and sex-matched 3T MRA subjects. Imaging parameters were optimized for spatial resolution at 7T to achieve 0.3- to 0.4-mm isotropic voxels. Quantitative analysis included contrast ratio and SNR measurements for the ICA, M1 to M4 arterial segments, and the lenticulostriate perforating arteries. Vascular volume was assessed using 3D segmentation. Semiquantitative vessel conspicuity ratings and motion artifact scoring were performed by blinded neuroradiologists.<h4>Results</h4>Fifteen patients (10 with 7T MRA, 5 with matched 3T controls) and 20 MRAs were analyzed. Contrast ratio was significantly higher at 7T for perforators, M3, and M4 branches (<i>P</i> < .05), with the greatest improvement in the M4 branches. Vascular volume was 147% greater at 7T (<i>P</i> = .018), reflecting improved small-vessel depiction and segmentation. Semiquantitative analysis showed significantly better vessel conspicuity at 7T for the M4 branches and lenticulostriate perforators (<i>P</i> < .01). Motion artifact scores were similar between field strengths (<i>P</i> = .118).<h4>Conclusions</h4>7T TOF-MRA significantly enhances vascular contrast and improves visualization of small arteries compared with 3T, making it a valuable tool for pediatric cerebrovascular imaging.",Valencia S; Machado-Rivas F; Cortes-Albornoz MC; Cartmell S; Griffin H; Orbach DB; Rameh V; See AP; Warfield SK; Afacan O; Jaimes C,"From the Department of Radiology (S.V., F.M.-R., M.C.C.-A., S.C., H.G., C.

41491374,Ultra-high spatial resolution at photon-counting computed tomography: technical insights and sustainable applications in cardiothoracic imaging.,"The latest technological advancements in CT enable the exploration of unprecedented limits of spatial resolution in in vivo imaging. Nowadays, ultra-high-resolution imaging is available by using CT with detector elements at or smaller than 0.25 mm along the z-axis, like those used on photon-counting CT (PCCT) scanners. However, spatial resolution represents a complex criterion of imaging performance affected not only by detector elements, but also by other complex variables that can interact with each other. Knowledge of these variables and the metrics to evaluate spatial resolution is key to performing accurate cardiothoracic examinations with optimized CT protocols, which can eventually reduce acquisition times and radiation doses. This opens to a sustainable cardiothoracic radiology that permits accurate cardiac CT evaluations also in patients previously excluded, due to high calcium score, metallic stents or obesity, and allows to reduce radiation doses to never-seen levels. In this article, we review the technical advancements that allowed such an increase in spatial resolution in PCCT, along with all technical determinants of spatial resolution, the metrics to evaluate it, the clinical impact of UHR at PCCT and its challenges on cardiothoracic imaging. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Knowledge of the ultra-high spatial resolution capabilities of new photon-counting CT technology is key to its best uses - performing accurate diagnostic examinations at unmatched low radiation doses and scanning patients previously excluded from cardiac CT examinations. KEY POINTS: Photon-counting CT scanners enable radiologists to evaluate cardiothoracic examinations with an exceptional spatial resolution, along with spectral information and dose reduction. The ultra-high spatial resolution in cardiovascular imaging enables accurate assessment in patients previously excluded, such as obese, those with extensive calcifications or metallic stents. Ultra-high spatial resolution empowers the visualization and follow-up of focal and diffuse lung diseases at unmatched accuracy and low radiation doses.",Occhipinti M; Clemente A; De Gori C; Positano V; Neglia D; Celi S; Meloni A; Berti S; Cademartiri F,"Department of Imaging, Fondazione Toscana Gabriele Monasterio/CNR, S.

41498861,Electrographic flow (EGF) mapping reveals sex-based differences in EGF patterns with women concentrated in phenotypes that benefit from EGF-guided ablation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Electrographic flow (EGF) mapping allows for the near real-time visualization of atrial wavefront propagation. Two factors have been found to be associated with higher rates of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence: presence of active extra-pulmonary vein (PV) sources and low electrographic flow consistency (EGFC) representing chaotic flow and abnormal atrial substrate. Based on these characteristics, EGF phenotypes have been identified: Type I patients have no sources + high EGFC, Type II have sources + high EGFC, Type III have sources + low EGFC, and Type IV have no sources + low EGFC.<h4>Objective</h4>Determine the sex differences in EGF phenotypes and post-ablation outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients were pooled from three prospective clinical trials: FLOW-AF, EVAL-AF, and the AF-FLOW Global Registry. From these trials, 104 persistent AF (PeAF) or long-standing PeAF patients underwent EGF mapping in 5 standardized, biatrial basket positions. Phenotyping into one of the 4 types was performed from post-PVI maps, and patients were followed for up to 12 months post-procedure, which included PVI-only and PVI + EGF-guided source ablation procedures. Outcomes were compared by chi-square tests, z-tests of proportions, logistic regression, and cox proportional models.<h4>Results</h4>There were 30 (29%) female patients with mean age 70 ± 8 years and 74 (71%) males with mean age 64 ± 10 years. There was no significant difference in left atrial dimension, left ventricular ejection fraction, or number of prior ablations between men and women. Men and women had distinct phenotype distributions (p = 0.007). Women had more sources and higher EGFC so were more likely than men to present as Type II (43% vs. 20%, p = 0.016), including when controlling for confounders (aOR 3.17, p = 0.024). Outcomes of these Type II patients were most improved by PVI + EGF-guided ablation when compared to PVI-only (91% vs. 50%, p = 0.038) without differences in intra-phenotype responsiveness to treatment by sex or intragroup hazard ratios by sex. Trends in phenotype differences of women vs. men were also present among those with other factors that increased CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores generally.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Female patients with PeAF are more likely to have extra-PV sources but healthy underlying substrate (Type II), which responds favorably to PVI + targeted source ablation. Ablation strategies should consequently target an individual's mechanism of disease.<h4>Trial registration numbers</h4>FLOW-AF: NCT04473963, FLOW EVAL-AF: NCT06260670, AF-FLOW Global Registry: NCT05481359.",Kutinsky I; Nilsson KR; Mrlik M; Kong MH; Mehta N; Castellano S,"Department of Electrophysiology, Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, USA.",Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing,2026-01-07,10.1007/s10840-025-02184-8,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cardiac; Atrial fibrillation; Arrhythmias; Sex differences; Pulmonary Vein Ablation; Basket Catheter; Panoramic Mapping; Electrographic Flow Mapping

41371944,"Anemia Mukt Bharat Index: Methodology and State Rankings of Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation Coverage in India, 2018-2019 to 2022-2023.","In 2018, the Government of India launched the Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) program to accelerate reductions in the prevalence of anemia among children aged 6-59 months, children aged 5-9 years, adolescents aged 10-19 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers through 6 programmatic interventions and 6 institutional mechanisms. We describe the process of computing the AMB index, aimed at providing timely and systematic information on iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation coverage across these groups to aid in evaluating the effectiveness of the program. This study presents data from fiscal year 2018-2019 to 2022-2023 on IFA supplementation coverage among these 5 groups. We calculated the AMB index that provides an average for IFA supplementation coverage for target groups. Data on the target groups were acquired from the AMB dashboard, and information on IFA supplementation coverage was sourced from the health management information system. The AMB index confirmed that between 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 IFA supplementation coverage increased overall in India by 22.1 percentage points, from 35.5% to 57.6%. During this period, IFA supplementation coverage increased for all target groups including pregnant women, children aged 6-59 months, children 5-9 years, adolescents aged 10-19 years, and lactating mothers. The supply chain management and reporting of the data on the portal were among the key factors that substantially impacted the IFA supplementation coverage. The IFA supplementation coverage will significantly increase if the IFA supply chain and reporting standards improve. We discuss the policy implications and suggestions to improve the overall IFA supplementation coverage across India.",Rizvi ZA; Singh J; Mishra P; Kumar A; Saini A; Patel N; Agarwal N; Yadav K; Joe W,"Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Delhi, India.","Global health, science and practice",2026-01-06,10.9745/ghsp-d-24-00077,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
41494823,Operationalizing Client-Centered Care: A Strategic Framework and Measurement Approach to Guide Sexual and Reproductive Health Programming.,"<h4>Background</h4>Promoting client-centered care (CCC) has been a long-standing goal for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programs. MSI Reproductive Choices (MSI), a global SRH service delivery organization, set out to fully operationalize CCC delivery utilizing a new strategic framework and measurement approach.<h4>Development of the approach</h4>The framework was developed by a global technical group at MSI, based on a literature review, country pilots in Nepal and Zambia, and practical experience in service delivery and quality improvement. It is based on a socioecological model, recognizing that SRH client experience is determined by the behavior of the provider, the managerial support given to providers, and the broader organizational culture. The accompanying composite CCC metric assesses performance across these 3 levels annually using program monitoring tools. A digital results dashboard links to a suite of guidance and tools to support CCC improvement.<h4>Lessons learned</h4>SRH programs in 28 countries have been monitoring their progress on CCC since 2021, and a majority have made improvements in their CCC performance since then. Using the annual CCC results, global support staff and country managers have selected interventions based on local needs, including CCC training, client feedback systems, and client experience checklists. Implementation of a global staff engagement survey has been instrumental in CCC measurement, complementing preexisting client exit interview and quality audit processes. A global CCC monitoring process allows sharing of successes and positive practice, and staff have supported and championed CCC.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Recognizing the critical influences of provider support and engagement as well as broader organizational culture has been pivotal in scaled operationalization of CCC within SRH programs. The simple framework and accompanying metric can be adapted to fit available tools and data systems in other institutions to support attainment of the highest standards of quality care and respect for client rights.",Church K; Page G; Aryasinghe S; Shrestha R; Chinyama IW; Morris M; Austen K; Argenziano A,"Independent consultant, London, UK. kathrynchurch@gmail.com pagegeorgina@gmail.com angela.argenziano@msichoices.org.","Global health, science and practice",2026-01-06,10.9745/ghsp-d-24-00025,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
