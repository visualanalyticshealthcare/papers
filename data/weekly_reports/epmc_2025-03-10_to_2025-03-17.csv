40081216,To see or not to see: Does foot visualization in immersive virtual reality influence gait parameters of youths with neuromotor impairments when performing walking-related activities? ,"Immersive virtual reality (VR) experienced through a head-mounted display (HMD) offers the possibility to practice real-world situations in a safe and motivating way in pediatric neurorehabilitation. As the HMD blocks the view of the physical world, patients lack visual feedback of their body parts. Foot visualization in the virtual environment could inform patients about their feet's position during walking-related activities. How does foot visualization affect spatial gait parameters of youths with neuromotor gait impairments during everyday walking tasks with an immersive VR-HMD? In this cross-sectional study, 15 youths with neuromotor gait impairments (mean age 12.3 years) performed four walking-related tasks wearing the VR-HMD Meta Quest 2. Walking through the virtual environment, they had to place their feet as accurately as possible on bollards, step over a plank, balance over a beam, and cross a gap. We used a Vicon motion capture system to assess spatial gait parameters when the participants could not see their feet and when a real-time virtual model of their feet was integrated into the virtual environment. In the bollard task, foot visualization had a large positive effect (Hedges' g = 0.82) on the foot placement accuracy, with a reduction in deviation from the bollard center from 12.1 cm (IQR: 16 cm) to 6.5 cm (IQR: 5.1 cm) (p < 0.001). Further, the maximum step height of the leading foot when overstepping the plank decreased by 2.9 cm (g = 0.4, p = 0.05). Foot visualization did not influence the spatial gait parameters when balancing over a beam or crossing a gap. Pediatric patients who practice walking-related activities with an immersive VR-HMD can benefit from foot visualization, as it increases foot placement accuracy for certain tasks. However, technical solutions have to become simpler for the clinical implementation of foot visualization.",Ammann-Reiffer C; Kläy A; Rhiel S; Keller U; van Hedel HJA,"Swiss Children's Rehab - Research Department, University Children's Hospital Zurich - Eleonore Foundation, University of Zurich, Affoltern am Albis, Switzerland; Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich - Eleonore Foundation, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

40080492,A novel flexible near-infrared endoscopic device that enables real-time artificial intelligence fluorescence tissue characterization. ,"Real-time endoscopic rectal lesion characterization employing artificial intelligence (AI) and near-infrared (NIR) imaging of the fluorescence perfusion indicator agent Indocyanine Green (ICG) has demonstrated promise. However, commercially available fluorescence endoscopes do not possess the flexibility and anatomical reach capabilities of colonoscopy while commercial flexible scopes do not yet provide beyond visible spectral imaging. This limits the application of this AI-NIR classification technology. Here, to close this technical gap, we present our development of a colonoscope-compatible flexible imaging probe for NIR-ICG visualization combined with a full field of view machine learning (ML) algorithm for fluorescence quantification and perfusion pattern cross-correlation (including first in human testing). The imaging probe is capable of 133µm minimum object resolution, with a maximum working distance of 50mm and an excitation illumination power of 52mW with 75o average field of illumination (meaning minimum device tip distance from target is 13 mm for a 2 cm polyp). The system demonstrated ex-vivo and in-vivo NIR visualization of clinically relevant concentrations of ICG in both resected and in situ (extracorporeally) colon in patients undergoing colorectal resection. A previously developed AI-NIR perfusion quantification algorithm was applied to videos of a bench model of varying ICG flow captured with the developed flexible system with added ML features generated full field of view pixel-level fluorescence time-series measurements capable of distinguishing distinct ICG flow regions in the image via correlative dynamic fluorescence intensity profiles. Jaccard Index comparison of the AI -generated flow regions against manually delineated flow regions resulted in 79% accuracy. While further clinical validation of the AI-NIR polyp classification method is on-going (in the Horizon Europe Awarded CLASSICA project), other use case applications of NIR colonoscopy include simpler perioperative perfusion assessment in patients undergoing colorectal resection and combination with targeted agents in development thus encouraging continuing development and design optimization of this flexible NIR imaging probe to enable clinical and commercial translation.",Gallagher G; Malallah R; Epperlein JP; Dalli J; Hardy N; Jindal A; MacAonghusa PG; Cahill RA,"School of Medicine, The Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",PloS one,2025-03-13,10.1371/journal.pone.0317771,6.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(title,abstract); machine learning(abstract)",

40075509,Prediction of peripheral lymph node metastasis (LNM) in thyroid cancer using delta radiomics derived from enhanced CT combined with multiple machine learning algorithms. ,"This study aimed to develop a model for predicting peripheral lymph node metastasis (LNM) in thyroid cancer patients by combining enhanced CT radiomic features with machine learning algorithms. It increased the clinical utility and interpretability of the predictions through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values and nomograms for model explanation and visualization. Clinical and enhanced CT image data from 375 patients with thyroid cancer confirmed by postoperative pathology at Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital were collected from January 2015 to July 2023. Among them, there were 88 patients in the LNM group and 287 patients in the non-LNM group. The delta radiomic features of the tumours were extracted. Various machine learning algorithms (such as SVM, GBM, RF, XGBoost, KNN, and LightGBM) were trained on the clinical and radiomic feature data sets and used to construct a reliable prediction model. During model training, cross-validation was used to evaluate model performance, and the optimal model was selected. In addition, SHAP values were used to interpret the prediction results of the optimal model, analyse the contribution of each feature to the prediction results, and further develop a nomogram to visually display the prediction results. Univariate analysis confirmed that sex, Hashimoto's disease, tumour adjacency to the thyroid capsule, pathological subtype, Delta Radscore, and Radscore 1 are risk factors for peripheral lymph node metastasis in thyroid cancer patients. The machine learning model based on enhanced CT radiomics performed well in predicting peripheral lymph node metastasis in thyroid cancer patients. In the test set, the optimal model, SVM, achieved high AUC (0.879), sensitivity (0.849), and specificity (0.769) values. Through SHAP value analysis, the importance and contribution of tumour adjacency to the thyroid capsule, pathological subtype, Delta Radscore, and Radscore 1 in the prediction were clarified, providing a more detailed and intuitive basis for clinical decision-making. The nomogram illustrated the model prediction process, facilitating understanding and application by clinicians. This study successfully constructed a model for predicting peripheral lymph node metastasis in thyroid cancer patients on the basis of enhanced CT radiomics combined with machine learning and improved the interpretability and clinical utility of the model through SHAP values and nomograms.

40064613,Unveiling the power of R: a comprehensive perspective for laboratory medicine data analysis.,"R language has gained traction in laboratory medicine for its statistical power and dynamic tools like RMarkdown and RShiny. However, there is limited literature summarizing R packages and functions tailored for laboratory medicine, making it difficult for clinical laboratory workers to access these tools. Additionally, varying algorithms across R packages can lead to inconsistencies in published reports. This review addresses these challenges by providing an overview of R's evolution and its key features, followed by a summary of statistical methods implemented in R, including platform comparisons, precision verification, factor analysis, and the establishment of reference intervals (RIs). We also highlight the development and validation of predictive models using techniques such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, k-means clustering, and backpropagation neural networks - all implemented in R. To ensure transparency and reproducibility in research, a checklist is provided for authors publishing papers using R for data analysis in laboratory medicine. In the final section, the potential of R in big data analytics is explored, focusing on standardized reporting through RMarkdown and the creation of user-friendly data visualization platforms with RShiny.

40068126,Telemedicine Prescribing by US Mental Health Care Providers: National Cross-Sectional Survey.,"<h4>Background</h4>In the postpandemic era, telemedicine continues to enable mental health care access for many people, especially persons living in areas with mental health care provider shortages. However, as lawmakers consider long-term telemedicine policy decisions, some question the safety and appropriateness of prescribing via telemedicine, and whether there should be requirements for in-person evaluation, especially for controlled substances.<h4>Objective</h4>Our objective was to assess US telemental health care provider perceptions of comfort and perceived safety in prescribing medications, including controlled substances, via telemedicine.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional survey of US telemental health care providers who prescribe via telemedicine, using nonprobability, availability sampling of a national telehealth research panel from February 13 to April 28, 2024. We used descriptive statistics, visualization, and thematic analysis to analyze results. We assessed differences in response distribution by health care provider licensure type (physician vs nonphysician) and specialty (psychiatry vs nonpsychiatry) using the Mann-Whitney U test.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 115 screened and eligible panelists completed the survey. Overall, participants indicated high levels of comfort with prescribing via telemedicine, with 84% (102/115) of health care providers indicating they strongly agree with the statement indicating comfort in prescribing medications via telemedicine. However, participants indicated less comfort in prescribing if they have never seen a patient in person, or if the patient is located out-of-state. Most participants indicated they can safely prescribe controlled substances via telemedicine, without having previously provided care to a patient in person. However, 14.8% (17/115) to 19.1% (30/115) of health care providers (by schedule) felt that they could rarely or never safely prescribe controlled substances. There were some differences in perception of comfort and safety by licensure and specialty. Among controlled substance schedules, participants indicated the least perceived safety with schedule IV medications, and the most safety with schedule II and III medications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These health care providers were highly comfortable prescribing both scheduled and unscheduled medications via telemedicine. Comfort and perceived safety with telemedicine prescribing varied somewhat by licensure type (physician vs nonphysician) and specialty (psychiatry vs nonpsychiatry). Perceived safety varied moderately for scheduled medications (controlled substances), especially for schedule IV and V medications. Participants indicated use of adaptive strategies to prescribe safely depending upon the clinical context. In ongoing efforts, we are analyzing additional survey results and conducting qualitative research related to telemedicine prescribing.

40068122,Detecting Changes in Singlet Oxygen and Viscosity during Apoptosis-Ferroptosis Mediated Photodynamic Therapy and Establishing Visual Imaging of Fatty Liver.,"Cancer is a serious global health threat, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective treatment method for cancer. This therapy works by generating a large amount of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) under the influence of oxygen and light, which induces apoptosis in tumor cells, leading to their destruction. However, the resistance of cells to apoptosis limits the development of PDT, and thus the combination of ferroptosis and apoptosis provides a new perspective for PDT. During PDT and ferroptosis, the levels of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and the microenvironment (viscosity) within cells often change. To address this, this study developed a novel fluorescent probe, <b>NI-QM-OH</b>, based on the TICT-ICT effect, capable of monitoring changes in <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and viscosity during PDT. The probe exhibits excellent selectivity, high sensitivity, and a low LOD (0.38 μM), and has been successfully applied for bioimaging in HepG2, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells, as well as for monitoring viscosity and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> levels in zebrafish. Most importantly, <b>NI-QM-OH</b> also enables the visualization of the diagnosis of fatty liver disease (both alcoholic and nonalcoholic).",Dai Y; Xiao L; Liao J; Han Z; Fu N,"Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Analytical Science of Food Safety and Biology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Analysis and Detection for Food Safety, College of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, P.

40078668,Multimodal Metaverse Healthcare: A Collaborative Representation and Adaptive Fusion Approach for Generative Artificial-Intelligence-Driven Diagnosis. ,"The metaverse enables immersive virtual healthcare environments, presenting opportunities for enhanced care delivery. A key challenge lies in effectively combining multimodal healthcare data and generative artificial intelligence abilities within metaverse-based healthcare applications, which is a problem that needs to be addressed. This paper proposes a novel multimodal learning framework for metaverse healthcare, MMLMH, based on collaborative intra- and intersample representation and adaptive fusion. Our framework introduces a collaborative representation learning approach that captures shared and modality-specific features across text, audio, and visual health data. By combining modality-specific and shared encoders with carefully formulated intrasample and intersample collaboration mechanisms, MMLMH achieves superior feature representation for complex health assessments. The framework's adaptive fusion approach, utilizing attention mechanisms and gated neural networks, demonstrates robust performance across varying noise levels and data quality conditions. Experiments on metaverse healthcare datasets demonstrate MMLMH's superior performance over baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics. Longitudinal studies and visualization further illustrate MMLMH's adaptability to evolving virtual environments and balanced performance across diagnostic accuracy, patient-system interaction efficacy, and data integration complexity. The proposed framework has a unique advantage in that a similar level of performance is maintained across various patient populations and virtual avatars, which could lead to greater personalization of healthcare experiences in the metaverse. MMLMH's successful functioning in such complicated circumstances suggests that it can combine and process information streams from several sources. They can be successfully utilized in next-generation healthcare delivery through virtual reality.",Lv J; Slowik A; Rani S; Kim BG; Chen CM; Kumari S; Li K; Lyu X; Jiang H,"The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University, Jinzhou 121012, China.","Research (Washington, D.C.)",2025-03-12,10.34133/research.0616,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); data(abstract),
40065477,Network pharmacological approach combined with weighted gene co-expression network analysis identifies CDKN2A as the keg target of Changweiqing against colorectal cancer.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>Changweiqing (CWQ) is a Chinese herbal formula for the treatment of the gastrointestinal tract diseases, but its role in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been clarified. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of CWQ in CRC treatment through bioinformatics analysis and network pharmacology.<h4>Methods</h4>Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform and SwissTargetPrediction database were used to collect the bioactive components of CWQ. The databases including DisgeNET, GeneCards, MalaCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man and Comparative Toxicogenomics were used to obtain CRC-related targets. The Cancer Genome Atlas - colon adenocarcinoma dataset was used to obtain prognosis-related genes in CRC based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A protein-protein interaction network was constructed to screen core targets, with STRING database and Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery database. Molecular docking was performed with AutoDock Vina software. Core targets were further analyzed using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis platform, Human Protein Atlas database, University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN) and GeneMANIA database. In vitro experiments were further performed to investigate the effects of quercetin, one of the main components of CWQ, on CRC cells.<h4>Results</h4>6356, 1901 and 2980 CRC-related genes were obtained from differential expression analysis, WGCNA and open access databases, respectively. CWQ contained a total of 70 bioactive ingredients, of which 64 ingredients had a total of 836 therapeutic targets. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that CWQ may be involved in regulating pathways in cancer, MAPK signaling pathway and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, and further analysis identified 14 core targets of CWQ. These core targets were significantly correlated with cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway and pathways in cancer. Among these core targets, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 A (CDKN2A) expression was closely associated with shorter overall survival and clinical stage of CRC patients. The main bioactive ingredients of CWQ targeting CDKN2A were quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, 7-O-methylisomucronulatol and 7-Methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone. Additionally, quercetin caused G0/G1 phase arrest and inhibited the viability of CRC cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The active ingredients of CWQ may play an anti-CRC role through multi-targets and multi-pathways, regulating the cell cycle and cell viability of CRC cells.",Zushuai M; Yanrong J; Chengdu Z; Xu Z; Qianshan D,"Department of Gastroenterology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Zhongxiang, Hubei, 431900, China.",Hereditas,2025-03-10,10.1186/s41065-025-00405-8,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract); informatics(abstract),Colorectal Cancer; Cdkn2a; Wgcna; Network Pharmacology; Changweiqing
40085845,"Analyzing Online Search Trends for Kidney, Prostate, and Bladder Cancers in China: Infodemiology Study Using Baidu Search Data (2011-2023). ","Cancers of the bladder, kidney, and prostate are the 3 major genitourinary cancers that significantly contribute to the global burden of disease (GBD) and continue to show increasing rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In mainland China, understanding the cancer burden on patients and their families is crucial; however, public awareness and concerns about these cancers, particularly from the patient's perspective, remain predominantly focused on financial costs. A more comprehensive exploration of their needs and concerns has yet to be fully addressed. This study aims to analyze trends in online searches and user information-seeking behaviors related to bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers-encompassing descriptive terms (eg, ""bladder cancer,"" ""kidney cancer,"" ""prostate cancer"") as well as related synonyms and variations-on both national and regional scales. This study leverages data from mainland China's leading search engine to explore the implications of these search patterns for addressing user needs and improving health management. The study analyzed Baidu Index search trends for bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers (from January 2011 to August 2023) at national and provincial levels. Search volume data were analyzed using the joinpoint regression model to calculate annual percentage changes (APCs) and average APCs (AAPCs), identifying shifts in public interest. User demand was assessed by categorizing the top 10 related terms weekly into 13 predefined topics, including diagnosis, treatment, and traditional Chinese medicine. Data visualization and statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9. Results revealed keyword trends, demographic distributions, and public information needs, offering insights into health communication and management strategies based on online information-seeking behavior. Three cancer topics were analyzed using 39 search keywords, yielding a total Baidu Search Index (BSI) of 43,643,453. From 2011 to 2015, the overall APC was 15.2% (P<.05), followed by -2.8% from 2015 to 2021, and 8.9% from 2021 to 2023, with an AAPC of 4.9%. Bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers exhibited AAPCs of 2.8%, 3.9%, and 6.8%, respectively (P<.05). The age distribution of individuals searching for these cancer topics varied across the topics. Geographically, searches for cancer were predominantly conducted by people from East China, who accounted for approximately 30% of each cancer search query. Regarding user demand, the total BSI for relevant user demand terms from August 2022 to August 2023 was 676,526,998 out of 2,570,697,380 (15.74%), representing only a limited total cancer-related search volume. Online searches and inquiries related to genitourinary cancers are on the rise. The depth of users' information demands appears to be influenced by regional economic levels.

Using data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study, we analyzed deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to IHD triggered by hyperglycemia, with detailed analysis by region, gender, and age. The age-period-cohort model was used to assess the impact of age, cohort, and period on age-standardized disease rates across different Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) regions, and decomposition analysis was employed to disentangle the contributions of population, aging, and epidemiological changes. In 2021, approximately 14-15% of IHD's DALYs and deaths were attributed to high fasting plasma glucose (HFPG), with a nonsignificant decrease in the annual average percentage change of DALYs. In middle, low-middle, and low SDI regions, the age-standardized mortality rates caused by HFPG are increasing, particularly among males. In high-middle and high SDI regions, the effects of aging and epidemiological changes surpass population growth, whereas in low SDI regions, population growth is the main factor. By 2050, the global Age-Standardized Mortality Rate of IHD attributed to HFPG is projected to reach 16.96. More data can be accessed by visiting the disease burden visualization platform.

The integration of ECG signal visualization with AI-based abnormality detection empowers users to independently and confidently assess their physiological signals. In this study, we investigated a novel method for visualizing ECG signals using polar transformations of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrograms and evaluated the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in predicting atrial fibrillation from these polar transformed spectrograms. The ECG data, which are available from the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017, were categorized into four classes: normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, other rhythms, and noise. Preprocessing steps included ECG signal filtering, STFT-based spectrogram generation, and reverse polar transformation to generate final polar spectrogram images. These images were used as inputs for deep CNN models, where three pre-trained deep CNNs were used for comparisons. The results demonstrated that deep learning-based predictions using polar transformed spectrograms were comparable to existing methods. Furthermore, the polar transformed images offer a compact and intuitive representation of rhythm characteristics in ECG recordings, highlighting their potential for wearable applications.",Kwon D; Kang H; Lee D; Kim YC,"Medical Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Division of Digital Healthcare, College of Software and Digital Healthcare Convergence, Yonsei University, Wonju, Republic of Korea.",PloS one,2025-03-10,10.1371/journal.pone.0317630,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40085831,Estimating the Burden of Common Mental Disorders Attributable to Lifestyle Factors: Protocol for the Global Burden of Disease Lifestyle and Mental Disorder (GLAD) Project. ,"The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) collects and calculates risk-outcome data for modifiable lifestyle exposures (eg, dietary intake) and physical health outcomes (eg, cancers). These estimates form a critical digital resource tool, the GBD VizHub data visualization tool, for governments and policy makers to guide local, regional, and global health decisions. Despite evidence showing the contributions of lifestyle exposures to common mental disorders (CMDs), such as depression and anxiety, GBD does not currently generate these lifestyle exposure-mental disorder outcome pairings. This gap is due to a lack of uniformly collected and analyzed data about these exposures as they relate to CMDs. Such data are required to quantify whether, and to what degree, the global burden of CMDs could be reduced by targeting lifestyle factors at regional and global levels. We have established the Global burden of disease Lifestyle And mental Disorder (GLAD) Taskforce to address this gap. This study aims to generate the necessary estimates to afford the inclusion of lifestyle exposures as risk factors for CMDs in the GBD study and the GBD digital visualization tools, initially focusing on the relationship between dietary intake and CMDs. The GLAD project is a multicenter, collaborative effort to integrate lifestyle exposures as risk factors for CMDs in the GBD study. To achieve this aim, global epidemiological studies will be recruited to conduct harmonized data analyses estimating the risk, odds, or hazards of lifestyle exposures with CMD outcomes. Initially, these models will focus on the relationship between dietary intake, as defined by the GBD, and anxiety and depression. As of August 2024, 18 longitudinal cohort studies from 9 countries (Australia: n=4; Brazil: n=1; France: n=1; Italy: n=3; The Netherlands: n=3; New Zealand: n=1; South Africa: n=1; Spain: n=1; and United Kingdom: n=3) have agreed to participate in the GLAD project. Our comprehensive, collaborative approach allows for the concurrent execution of a harmonized statistical analysis protocol across multiple, internationally renowned epidemiological cohorts.

40078164,LLM-IE: a python package for biomedical generative information extraction with large language models. ,"Despite the recent adoption of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical information extraction (IE), challenges in prompt engineering and algorithms persist, with no dedicated software available. To address this, we developed LLM-IE: a Python package for building complete IE pipelines. The LLM-IE supports named entity recognition, entity attribute extraction, and relation extraction tasks. We benchmarked it on the i2b2 clinical datasets. The sentence-based prompting algorithm resulted in the best 8-shot performance of over 70% strict F1 for entity extraction and about 60% F1 for entity attribute extraction. We developed a Python package, LLM-IE, highlighting (1) an interactive LLM agent to support schema definition and prompt design, (2) state-of-the-art prompting algorithms, and (3) visualization features. The LLM-IE provides essential building blocks for developing robust information extraction pipelines.

40085402,MedKG: enabling drug discovery through a unified biomedical knowledge graph. ,"Biomedical knowledge graphs have emerged as powerful tools for drug discovery, but existing platforms often suffer from outdated information, limited accessibility, and insufficient integration of complex data. This study presents MedKG, a comprehensive and continuously updated knowledge graph designed to address these challenges in precision medicine and drug discovery. MedKG integrates data from 35 authoritative sources, encompassing 34 node types and 79 relationships. A Continuous Integration/Continuous Update pipeline ensures MedKG remains current, addressing a critical limitation of static knowledge bases. The integration of molecular embeddings enhances semantic analysis capabilities, bridging the gap between chemical structures and biological entities. To demonstrate MedKG's utility, a novel hybrid Relational Graph Convolutional Network for disease-drug link prediction, MedLINK was developed and used in case studies on clinical trial data for disease drug link prediction. Furthermore, a web-based application with user-friendly APIs and visualization tools was built, making MedKG accessible to both technical and non-technical users, which is freely available at http://pitools.niper.ac.in/medkg/.",Kumari M; Chauhan R; Garg P,"Department of Pharmacoinformatics, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), S.A.S.

40088859,Novel analogous tasks to assess material-specific memory impairments associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. ,"Episodic memory tasks employing verbal material are generally sensitive to material-specific memory impairments in individuals with left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE), whereas visuospatial memory tasks are less consistently failed by individuals with right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (RTLE). A limitation of these tasks is the possibility for the examinee to use verbalization strategies when tested with visuospatial stimuli, and visualization strategies with verbal material. In this study, we aimed to develop two new analogous computerized recognition tasks to identify material-specific memory impairments, adapted from those previously developed in our lab: one using verbal material (i.e., pseudowords), and the other visuospatial material (i.e., pictures depicting similar landscapes of mountains, trees, and lakes). Each task consists of a 3-trial learning phase and delayed recognition trials after 30 min. and two weeks. After having established normative data for adults (N = 124), we assessed the ability of each task to detect material-specific memory impairments in patients who have had surgery for LTLE (n = 16) or RTLE (n = 12). Both tasks have good psychometric properties. The RTLE group showed significantly poorer performance on the visuospatial than on the verbal memory test on all trials. The LTLE group showed significantly poorer performance on the verbal than on the visuospatial memory test on delayed (30-min. and 2-week) recognition trials. Memory profile on delayed recognition trials was concordant with the lateralization of epilepsy surgery in 87.5% of LTLE and in 83.3% of the RTLE group. This study provides preliminary clinical validation for our novel tasks to detect material-specific memory impairments in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy.",Landry A; Rouleau I; Desrochers V; Colucci E; Gravel V; Nguyen DK; Boucher O,"Département de psychologie, Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Montréal, Canada; Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montréal, Canada.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2025-03-14,10.1016/j.yebeh.2025.110366,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40081499,Multi-contrast 4DMR via MR multitasking: Early clinical experience and implication for liver stereotactic body radiation therapy. ,"Liver tumors have low contrast on 4DCT. A novel Multitasking (MT)MR imaging technique has been implemented on the MR simulator, providing both T1 and T2-weighted 4DMR images in a single 8-min free-breathing scan for better tumor delineation and motion evaluation. This study reports our early clinical experience of MTMR regarding tumor visibility, motion characteristics, and resultant dosimetry compared to post-contrast 4DCT for liver SBRT. Phantom motion validation was performed. Tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and motion were analyzed in 54 patients. Replanning for 17 patients (21 tumor volumes) was performed, and planning target volume receiving greater than 90% of the prescription (PTV_V90) was compared based on optimized dose distributions for each 4D dataset-derived PTV. Phantom motions in both 4DCT and MTMR datasets were within <1.8 mm of the programmed ground truth. The absolute CNR of MTMR-T1w and MTMR-T2w were significantly greater than post-contrast 4DCT. Tumor superior-inferior motions were significantly greater in MTMR than in 4DCT, while PTV volumes were not significantly different between the two 4D datasets. The PTV_V90 calculated from individual MTMR-T1w and 4DCT optimized plans were similar. However, a statistically significant 5 % reduction of PTV_V90 was observed when the optimized PTV_MTMR dose was superimposed on the respective PTV_4DCT, or vice versa for the re-planning patient cohort. This study demonstrates that the MTMR sequence offers superior tumor visualization and detects greater superior-inferior motion compared to 4DCT, enhancing the precision of radiotherapy planning for liver SBRT. While both imaging methods achieve comparable target volume coverage with individually optimized plans, discrepancies in tumor positioning lead to reduced coverage when plans are cross-applied, highlighting the importance of motion assessment accuracy. MTMR's ability to provide multiple contrast-weighted images in a single scan addresses limitations of traditional 4DCT and multi-sequence MR protocols, particularly for patients unable to receive contrast.",April Chau OW; Geoghegan T; Everts J; Chen J; Feng M; Chen WC; Scholey JE; Yang Y; Ohliger MA; Sheng K; Miao X; Fan Z; Yang W,"Department of Radiation Oncology, UC San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,2025-03-11,10.1016/j.radonc.2025.110839,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40063320,Barriers and Facilitators to Cross-Institutional Referrals: System Configuration Analysis of VA Staff Experiences.,"<h4>Background</h4>In 2014 and 2018, respectively, Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act (Choice Act) and the Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act (MISSION Act), which expanded eligibility for and use of cross-institutional referrals among U.S. Veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify facilitators and barriers to patient information sharing for cross-institutional, outpatient referrals resulting from policy changes.<h4>Design</h4>Applying the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) 2.0 framework, we conducted work system and configural analyses of semi-structured interviews.<h4>Participants</h4>Clinical and administrative staff in six Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility community care liaison program offices.<h4>Approach</h4>Interviews focused on barriers and facilitators to sharing patients' information across healthcare institutions. Transcripts were summarized by domain and coded to consensus, followed by directed content analysis and visualization using configural diagrams.<h4>Key results</h4>From 19 interviews, we characterized a nine-step, ad hoc referral process. Barriers were reported in four of nine referral steps: scheduling, coordination, sending of pre-visit clinical records, and receipt of post-visit records. Low adoption of new technology, strained relationships with CCN clinicians, and inconsistent policies were commonly reported barriers. Largely, perceived barriers were classified as technology, people, or organization factors. The COVID-19 pandemic and a transition between third-party administrators were reported as notable environment factors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>VA staff perceived increases in patient care delays and staff workload associated with social and technical barriers to sharing patients' information across healthcare institutions. In the cross-institutional referral process, we identified the primary configuration or combination of work system factors-technology, people, and organization- related to prevalent barriers. System-level interventions are needed to enhance relationships with clinicians across healthcare institutions, implement policies that guide patient information exchange, and design supportive technologies for efficient clinician communication during cross-institutional referrals.",Savoy A; Weaver FM; Patel H; Taylor A; Govier DJ; Hynes DM,"Center for Health Information and Communication (CIN 13-416), Health Systems Research, Richard L.

40064529,A nomogram to predict gestational diabetes mellitus: a multi-center retrospective study.,"While gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) poses great threat to the health of mothers and children, there is no standard early prediction model for this disease yet. This study developed and evaluated a nomogram for predicting GDM in early pregnancy. Overall, 1824 pregnant women were randomly divided into the training and internal validation sets in the ratio of 7:3, with additional 1604 pregnant women for external validation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to develop a prediction model for GDM, and a nomogram was utilized for model visualization. Risk factors in the prediction model involved age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, reproductive history, family history of diabetes, creatinine level, triglyceride level, low-density lipoprotein level, neutrophil count, and monocyte count. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision clinical analysis (DCA). The area under ROC curve (AUC) value of the model was 0.804 for the training set, and similar AUC values were obtained for the internal (0.800) and external (0.829) validation sets, verifying the stability of the model. The calibration curves showed that the probabilities of GDM predicted by the nomogram highly correlated with the observed frequency values. The DCA curves indicated that the prediction model is clinically useful, thus potentially aiding early pregnancy management in women.",Zhang R; Li Z; Xilifu N; Yang M; Dai Y; Zang S; Liu J,"Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200240, China.",Journal of molecular cell biology,2025-03-10,10.1093/jmcb/mjaf008,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),risk factors; Gestational Diabetes Mellitus; Nomogram
40075187,"Comparative analysis of organoid, air-liquid interface, and direct infection models for studying pathogen-host interactions in endometrial tissue. ","The endometrium is a critical component of female reproductive health. Endometritis can significantly affect women's health, leading to complications such as infertility, pregnancy failure, and intrauterine adhesions. Therefore, establishing a reliable and effective model of endometritis is essential for advancing research in female reproductive health. The air-liquid interface culture models epithelial exposure to both air and medium, supporting the study of apical-basal polarity and immune responses, but lacks the three-dimensional structure of organoids. Microinjection delivers bacteria directly into the organoid lumen, facilitating the study of bacterial invasion and replication, though it requires advanced technical skills and may not fully replicate natural infections. The direct infection of organoids in suspension culture offers a more realistic model of ascending infections by exposing the basal epithelial surfaces to bacteria, more closely mimicking in vivo conditions. Among the models tested, the direct infection method most accurately mirrors the progression of E. coli infection, showing its advantage in studying bacterial adhesion, replication, and epithelial barrier disruption. Our comparative analysis of microinjection, direct infection, and the ALI model highlighted distinct advantages and challenges associated with each. Microinjection offers precise delivery but is hindered by technical complexity and equipment demands. The ALI model, despite its efficacy, requires extended culture times and limits direct visualization of cell development. Conversely, the direct infection model, which involves the simple removal of Matrigel, proves to be user-friendly, cost-effective, and permits continuous observation of cell behavior. Nonetheless, the direct infection model still presents certain limitations that warrant further optimization.",Zhang X; Fan L; Zhang L; Liu Z,"Department of Gynecology, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, No. 251, Yaojiayuan Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100026, China.",Scientific reports,2025-03-12,10.1038/s41598-025-93374-x,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

To assess the usefulness, recommendation and accuracy of a new rt-CGM system in camp, 2024. Sensor glucose (SG) concentrations were measured by Dexcom G7 (G7) from 6 days prior to camp. Usefulness and recommendation were assessed by questionnaire. Twenty-one children with type 1 diabetes and 52 healthcare providers (HCPs) participated. CGM-associated metrics were measured 6 days prior to (off camp: 6 days) and during camp (on camp: 2 days). G7 was rated highly for its sensor insertion, visualization of SG variation and convenience during camp. The SG value accuracy scored relatively low. G7's usefulness and recommendation among campers were significantly higher than those of G6, utilized the previous year, and they were both almost equally highly rated by HCPs. The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) was 11.3% (G6: 16.0%) on camp and 11.0% (G6: 19.7%) off camp. The coefficient of variation was 34.4% (G6: 60.3%) on camp and 35.9% (G6: 63.1%) off camp, while the glucose management indicator was 7.44% for G7 (G6: 8.04%). The glycemic management metrics on camp were better than those off camp. Graphical analyses also showed sufficient accuracy.

40074774,Malabaricone C isolated from edible plants as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ,"Although the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic worldwide has gradually decreased, in some areas, the situation has not yet been stamped and has become a global health emergency. It is quite possible that we could again be threatened by a new coronavirus. Therefore, new nucleotide analog drugs and vaccines or using drug repositioning for SARS-CoV-2 still has been developed, yet their safety and efficacy against COVID-19 remains underexplored. Malabaricone C is 2,6-dihydroxyphenyl acylphenol found in edible plants such as the mace spice of nutmeg derived from the seeds of Myristica fragrans. In this study, we identified malabaricone C as the first inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 from natural food with a safe alternative for drugs. Malabaricone C and its chemical derivatives showed EC50 values of 1-1.5 μM against SARS-CoV-2 (WK-521, ancestral strain) and its variant strains in mammalian cells (HEK293T and Vero E6). In addition, we have successfully established novel evaluation system for the inhibition of SARS virus cell fusion by visualization for providing a versatile tool for study SARS-CoV-2 mediated fusion. Furthermore, our experiments suggested that malabaricone C could affect the distribution of sphingomyelin on the plasma membrane, which involves in viral infections. Thus, in light of the beneficial effect of malabaricone C on viral infection, the nontoxic malabaricone C is a suitable candidate as a drug that can be employed in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

This study aims to compare the microleakage performance of four restorative materials-bioactive composite resin (Activa Pronto), alkasite restorative (Cention N), compomer (Dyract Flow), and glass ionomer cement (Type 2 GIC)-in Class V cavities of extracted premolar teeth.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Forty non-carious, intact premolar teeth were selected and prepared with standardized Class V cavities. The teeth were randomly assigned to one of four groups (n = 10) and restored with the respective materials. The restorations underwent thermocycling, followed by microleakage testing using rhodamine dye. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), a technique that provides superior depth resolution and three-dimensional visualization of microleakage, was used to assess dye penetration at the tooth-restoration interface. Microleakage was then scored using a standardized grading system.<h4>Results</h4>Significant differences in microleakage were observed among the groups (χ<sup>2</sup> = 45.69; p < 0.001). Group 1 (bioactive composite resin) demonstrated the lowest microleakage, with predominantly Grade 0 and Grade 1 scores, while Group 4 (GIC) exhibited the highest microleakage, characterized mainly by Grade 3 scores. Bioactive composite resin exhibited significantly lower microleakage than alkasite, compomer, and GIC (p < 0.05).

40089691,Effect of India's flagship conditional maternity benefit scheme on utilization of maternal and child health services: evidence from a statewide evaluation study. ,"The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) is India's flagship Maternity Benefit Programme to improve maternal nutrition and child health. This study evaluates the functional status of the scheme, knowledge regarding the scheme and its effect on pattern of service utilization in a north Indian state. A three-pronged mixed-methods evaluation including household survey of beneficiary and non-beneficiary women, in-depth interviews of key stakeholders (district and state level program managers, program implementers and frontline workers) and review of secondary data from the PMMVY Common Application Software and state PMMVY dashboard was done. Household survey covered 1290 women, and 70 in-depth interviews were held with eligible women, and PMMVY managerial and implementation staff. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS version 22.0, qualitative data was analysed thematically and triangulated with quantitative results for effective analysis and conclusion. The study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of IIHMR Delhi. A strong political commitment with requisite systems and resources across all levels was observed. Coverage of PMMVY was less in urban areas (53.1% as compared to overall coverage of 95.9%). Knowledge of the scheme was high among both beneficiary and non-beneficiary women (97.8% beneficiary women and 94.2% non-beneficiary women). Utilization of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services were significantly poorer among non-beneficiary women for four antenatal check-ups (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, p = 0.04), childbirth registration (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18-0.45, p < 0.001) and child immunization (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.55, p < 0001). However, certain operational challenges were found related to beneficiary enrolment and use of PMMVY software, and a gap in intended and actual use of PMMVY incentive was observed (26.2% beneficiary women had spent the cash incentive on needs not related to nutrition or health). Despite operational challenges, PMMVY has been effective in improving the utilization of health services like antenatal check-ups, childbirth registration and child immunization. The benefits of the scheme may be maximized by addressing those limitations in its delivery.",Banerjee R; Singh BS; Sahrawat N; Mehrotra A; Swain S; Mishra RM; Antony P; Aparna U; Jain BK; Neogi SB,"International Institute of Health Management Research, New Delhi, Delhi, India.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2025-03-15,10.1186/s12884-025-07416-3,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
40063663,Implementation of Smart Triage combined with a quality improvement program for children presenting to facilities in Kenya and Uganda: An interrupted time series analysis.,"Sepsis occurs predominantly in low-middle-income countries. Sub-optimal triage contributes to poor early case recognition and outcomes from sepsis. Improved recognition and quality of care can lead to improved outcomes. We evaluated the impact of Smart Triage using improved time to intravenous antimicrobial administration in a multisite interventional study. Smart Triage, a digital platform with a risk score and clinical dashboard, was implemented (with control sites) in Kenya (February 2021-December 2022) and Uganda (April 2020-April 2022). Children presenting to the outpatient departments with an acute illness were enrolled. A controlled interrupted time series was used to assess the effect on time from arrival at the facility to intravenous antimicrobial administration. Secondary analyses included antimicrobial use, admission rates and mortality (NCT04304235). During the baseline period, the time to antimicrobials decreased significantly in Kenya (132 and 58 minutes) at control and intervention sites. In Uganda, the time to antimicrobials marginally decreased (3 minutes) at the intervention site. Then, during the implementation period in Kenya, the time to antimicrobials at the intervention site decreased by 98 min (57%, 95% CI 81-114) but increased by 49 min (21%, 95% CI: 23-76) at the control site. In Uganda, the time to antimicrobials initially decreased but was not sustained and there was no significant difference between intervention and control sites. At both intervention sites, there was a significant reduction in antimicrobial utilization of 47% (Kenya) and 33% (Uganda) compared to baseline. There was a reduction in admission rates of 47% (Kenya) and 33% (Uganda) compared to baseline. Mortality reduced by 25% (Kenya) and 75% (Uganda) compared to the baseline period. We showed significant improvements in time to intravenous antibiotics in Kenya but not Uganda, likely due to COVID-19, a short study period and resource constraints. The reduced antimicrobial use and admission and mortality rates are remarkable and welcome benefits. The admission and mortality rates should be interpreted cautiously as these were secondary outcomes.
