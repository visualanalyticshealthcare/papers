40638856,"Data Dashboard Acceptability, Use, and Perceived Effectiveness in Disseminating Local Overdose Data and Resources in a Rural New York State County: A Cross-Sectional Study.","<h4>Background</h4>In 2023, Cayuga County, a rural county in New York State, developed and published a publicly available, interactive overdose dashboard highlighting demographic, geographic, and time trends in suspected overdoses as well as substance use-related resources in the community. Despite the widespread use of data dashboards in the overdose crisis, there is little evidence to suggest that these dashboards can effectively disseminate data and enable public health data-driven decision-making, especially in a rural county. We conducted an evaluation of the Cayuga County Overdose Data Dashboard to fill this knowledge gap.<h4>Objective</h4>Our study aimed to evaluate the Cayuga County Overdose Data Dashboard's acceptability, use, and perceived effectiveness in disseminating overdose data and resources.<h4>Methods</h4>Following the launch of the dashboard, an online Qualtrics survey collected feedback from individuals older than 18 years of age living or working in Cayuga County, asking respondents to reflect upon their experience using the dashboard. The 10-minute survey assessed usage patterns and motivations to access the dashboard as well as the dashboard's ease of use, most valued design features, and overall perceived effectiveness in communicating information on overdoses and local resources. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.<h4>Results</h4>From May to December 2023, a total of 61 individuals from Cayuga County completed the survey, including those with lived substance use experience (n=8, 13%) as well as their close contacts (n=28, 46%), health care providers (n=12, 20%), law enforcement (n=11, 18%), and local public health and mental health care professionals (n=27, 44%). The user-friendly design and frequent updates facilitate engagement, as 54% (n=33) of respondents reported accessing the dashboard at least monthly and 75% (n=46) using it to inform decision-making. Most thought that the dashboard was easy to use (n=59, 97%) and very effective in disseminating information (n=46, 76%). From the 8 different types of overdose-related information portrayed on the dashboard, the most valued were the locations of treatment and recovery services, scoring an average of 4.75 (SD 0.65) on a 5-point scale (1=""Not important"" to 5=""Most important""), followed by the locations of free, publicly accessible Naloxone (mean 4.58, SD 0.89) and trends in fatal and nonfatal overdoses (mean 4.48, SD 0.81).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, this study suggests that the Cayuga County Overdose Data Dashboard effectively disseminates information and enables data-driven decision-making in the region. When developing a community-level dashboard, our findings underscore the necessity of a user-friendly design, frequent data updates, and inclusion of key information and visuals on local overdose trends and resources.",He Z; Salvage M; Noel CA,"Department of Public and Ecosystem Health, Cornell University, 350 Tower Road, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States.",Online journal of public health informatics,2025-07-10,10.2196/68977,15.2,"visualization(kw); dashboard(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Rural Health; Data Visualization; Community Resources; Data-driven Decision Making; Opioid-related Disorders Prevention And Control; Public Health Data Dashboard

40621897,Evidence on Methods for Communicating Health-Related Probabilities: Comparing the Making Numbers Meaningful Systematic Review to the 2021 IPDAS Evidence Paper Recommendations.,"PurposeTo summarize the degree to which evidence from our recent Making Numbers Meaningful (MNM) systematic review of the effects of data presentation format on communication of health numbers supports recommendations from the 2021 International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration papers on presenting probabilities.MethodsThe MNM review generated 1,119 distinct findings (derived from 316 papers) related to communication of probabilities to patients or other lay audiences, classifying each finding by its relation to audience task, type of stimulus (data and data presentation format), and up to 10 distinct sets of outcomes: identification and/or recall, contrast, categorization, computation, probability perceptions and/or feelings, effectiveness perceptions and/or feelings, behavioral intentions or behavior, trust, preference, and discrimination. Here, we summarize the findings related to each of the 35 IPDAS paper recommendations.ResultsStrong evidence exists to support several IPDAS recommendations, including those related to the use of part-to-whole graphical formats (e.g., icon arrays) and avoidance of verbal probability terms, 1-in-X formats, and relative risk formats to prevent amplification of probability perceptions, effectiveness perceptions, and/or behavioral intentions as well as the use of consistent denominators to improve computation outcomes. However, the evidence base appears weaker and less complete for other IPDAS recommendations (e.g., recommendations regarding numerical estimates in context and evaluative labels). The IPDAS papers and the MNM review agree that both communication of uncertainty and use of interactive formats need further research.ConclusionsThe idea that no one visual or numerical format is optimal for every probability communication situation is both an IPDAS panel recommendation and foundational to the MNM project's design. Although no MNM evidence contradicts IPDAS recommendations, the evidence base needed to support many common probability communication recommendations remains incomplete.HighlightsThe Making Numbers Meaningful (MNM) systematic review of the literature on communicating health numbers provides mixed support for the recommendations of the 2021 International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) evidence papers on presenting probabilities in patient decision aids.Both the IPDAS papers and the MNM project agree that no single visual or numerical format is optimal for every probability communication situation.The MNM review provides strong evidentiary support for IPDAS recommendations in favor of using part-to-whole graphical formats (e.g., icon arrays) and consistent denominators.The MNM review also supports the IPDAS cautions against verbal probability terms and 1-in-X formats as well as its concerns about the potential biasing effects of relative risk formats and framing.MNM evidence is weaker related to IPDAS recommendations about placing numerical estimates in context and use of evaluative labels.",Zikmund-Fisher BJ; Benda NC; Ancker JS,"Department of Health Behavior and Health Equity, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,2025-07-07,10.1177/0272989x251346811,7.5,"visualization(kw); visual(kw,abstract); data(kw,abstract)",risk; Health Communication; Data Visualization; Patient Education As Topic
40628872,RareInsight simplifies the communication of genetic results for rare disease patients.,"Following a confirmed genetic diagnosis, rare disease patients and their families encounter significant challenges in accessing diagnostic information and support. Patients and non-specialists are increasingly expected to interpret and share test results; however, existing standards are primarily designed for specialists. These standards fail to address the needs of resource-limited populations where low genomic literacy hampers accurate dissemination of genetic results. This research introduces RareInsight, an open-source, interactive dashboard designed to enhance the accessibility, comprehension, and collaboration of genetic data among patients, caregivers, clinicians, and researchers. Developed using shinydashboard, RareInsight was evaluated using whole exome sequencing data from skeletal dysplasia patients. It allows users to input and view Variant Call Format files and includes a searchable ClinVar variant table with filtering options, providing access to multiple resources based on search terms. RareInsight aims to simplify the dissemination of complex genetic information beyond the clinical setting. This dashboard serves as a pilot study demonstrating the potential of patient-centered interactive dashboards for the rare disease community.",Coetzer KC; Zemzem F; Akurut E; Wiafe GA; Awe OI,"Division of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.",Scientific reports,2025-07-08,10.1038/s41598-025-09744-y,7.0,"dashboard(kw,abstract); data(abstract); informatics(kw)",Bioinformatics; Genetic Testing; Rare Diseases; Clinical Dashboard; Shinydashboard
40639971,Visualization of Nerve Pathology and Correlation with Clinical Severity in Bell's Palsy Using 3D Double-Echo Steady-State with Water Excitation Sequence.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Bell's palsy (BP) is the most common cause of facial nerve (FN) palsy. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic ability of the 3D Double-Echo Steady-State with Water Excitation (3D-DESS-WE) sequence to visualize pathological changes in the FN of BP patients.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed 30 BP patients who underwent 3T MRI including 3D-DESS-WE within 30 days of onset and 60 sex-and age±2-matched controls. Qualitative evaluation of FN signal intensity (SI<sub>FN</sub>) and thickness (TH<sub>FN</sub>) was performed using a 3-point scale. Quantitative metrics included SI<sub>FN</sub> and TH<sub>FN</sub> measurements and affected-to-unaffected ratios (SR<sub>A/U</sub> and TR<sub>A/U</sub>) in the BP group, and right-to-left ratios in controls. Interobserver agreement, group comparisons, correlations with clinical severity (Yanagihara score), and diagnostic performance were assessed. In a subset of 17 matched pairs, the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced T1WI (CE-T1WI) was assessed, and its agreement with 3D-DESS-WE-based qualitative assessment was evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Qualitative scores for SI<sub>FN</sub> and TH<sub>FN</sub> were significantly higher in the BP group than in controls (<i>P</i> < .001), with high interobserver agreement (κ = 0.810, 0.788, respectively). When dichotomized (score 0 vs. 1-2), qualitative assessments showed good diagnostic performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.82 for SI<sub>FN</sub>, and 0.90 and 0.80 for TH<sub>FN</sub>, respectively. Neither qualitative score correlated significantly with clinical severity. Agreement between 3D-DESS-WE-based and CE-T1WI-based qualitative assessments was substantial to almost perfect (κ = 0.766-0.882). In quantitative analysis, both SI<sub>FN</sub> and TH<sub>FN</sub> were significantly higher on the affected side in the BP group (<i>P</i> < .001), whereas no significant lateral differences were observed in controls. Although SI<sub>FN</sub>, TH<sub>FN</sub>, and SR<sub>A/U</sub> did not correlate significantly with clinical severity, TR<sub>A/U</sub> was significantly inversely correlated with the Yanagihara score (r = -0.413, <i>P</i> = .02), which corresponds to a positive correlation with clinical severity. The Yanagihara score was the only independent predictor for TR<sub>A/U</sub> in multiple regression analysis (β = -0.425, <i>P</i> = .04). ROC analysis showed high diagnostic performance: AUC = 0.908 for SR<sub>A/U</sub> and 0.927 for TR<sub>A/U</sub>.<h4>Conclusions</h4>3D-DESS-WE may be a valuable tool for the routine clinical assessment of BP.<h4>Abbreviations</h4>3D-DESS-WE＝3D Double-Echo Steady-State with Water Excitation; 3D-PSIF＝3D reversed fast imaging in steady-state free precession.",Fujii H; Kikuchi T; Fujii N; Chiba E; Masuoka S; Nakamata A; Hamamoto K; Matsuki M; Mori H,"From the Department of Radiology (H.F., T.K., N.F., E.C., S.M., A.N., K.H., M.M., H.M.), Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan.",AJNR.

40578394,Prospective quality control in chest radiography based on the reconstructed 3D human body.,"<i>Objective.</i>Chest radiography requires effective quality control (QC) to reduce high retake rates. However, existing QC measures are all retrospective and implemented after exposure, often necessitating retakes when image quality fails to meet standards and thereby increasing radiation exposure to patients. To address this issue, we proposed a 3D human body (3D-HB) reconstruction algorithm to realize prospective QC. Our objective was to investigate the feasibility of using the reconstructed 3D-HB for prospective QC in chest radiography and evaluate its impact on retake rates.<i>Approach.</i>This prospective study included patients indicated for posteroanterior (PA) and lateral (LA) chest radiography in May 2024. A 3D-HB reconstruction algorithm integrating the Skinned Multi-Person Linear eXpressive model and the Hybrid Analytical-Neural Inverse Kinematics eXpressive algorithm was proposed to convert patients' 2D images into 3D-HBs. QC metrics regarding patient positioning and collimation were assessed using chest radiographs (reference standard) and 3D-HBs, with results compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), linear regression, and receiver operating characteristic curves. For retake rate evaluation, a real-time 3D-HB visualization interface was developed and chest radiography was conducted in two four-week phases: the first without prospective QC and the second with prospective QC. Retake rates between the two phases were compared using chi-square tests.<i>Main results.</i>324 participants were included (mean age, 42 years ± 19 [SD]; 145 men; 324 PA and 294 LA examinations). The ICCs for the clavicle and midaxillary line angles were 0.80 and 0.78, respectively. Linear regression showed good relation for clavicle angles (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>: 0.655) and midaxillary line angles (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>: 0.616). In PA chest radiography, the AUCs of 3D-HBs were 0.89, 0.87, 0.91 and 0.92 for assessing scapula rotation, lateral tilt, centered positioning and central x-ray alignment respectively, with 97% accuracy in collimation assessment. In LA chest radiography, the AUCs of 3D-HBs were 0.87, 0.84, 0.87 and 0.88 for assessing arms raised, chest rotation, centered positioning and central x-ray alignment respectively, with 94% accuracy in collimation assessment. In retake rate evaluation, 3995 PA and 3295 LA chest radiographs were recorded. The implementation of prospective QC based on the 3D-HB reduced retake rates from 8.6% to 3.5% (PA) and 19.6% to 4.9% (LA) (<i>p</i>< .001).<i>Significance.</i>The reconstructed 3D-HB is a feasible tool for prospective QC in chest radiography, providing real-time feedback on patient positioning and collimation before exposure. Prospective QC based on the reconstructed 3D-HB has the potential to reshape the future of radiography QC by significantly reducing retake rates and improving clinical standardization.",Tan Y; Ye Z; Ye J; Hou Y; Li S; Liang Z; Li H; Tang J; Xia C; Li Z,"Department of Radiology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China.",Physics in medicine and biology,2025-07-08,10.1088/1361-6560/ade94c,4.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw),Artificial intelligence; Quality control; Chest Radiography; 3D Human Body Reconstruction; Retake Rate
40627473,CNNViT-MILF-a: A Novel Architecture Leveraging the Synergy of CNN and ViT for Motor Imagery Classification.,"Accurate motor imagery (MI) classification in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is essential for applications in engineering, medicine, and artificial intelligence. Due to the limitations of single-model approaches, hybrid model architectures have emerged as a promising direction. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate strong complementary capabilities, leading to enhanced performance. This study proposes a series of novel models, termed as CNNViT-MI, to explore the synergy of CNNs and ViTs for MI classification. Specifically, five fusion strategies were defined: parallel integration, sequential integration, hierarchical integration, early fusion, and late fusion. Based on these strategies, eight candidate models were developed. Experiments were conducted on four datasets: BCI competition IV dataset 2a, BCI competition IV dataset 2b, high gamma dataset, and a self-collected MI-GS dataset. The results demonstrate that CNNViT-MILF-a achieves the best performance among all candidates by leveraging ViT as the backbone for global feature extraction and incorporating CNN-based local representations through a late fusion strategy. Compared to the best-performing state-ofthe-art (SOTA) methods, mean accuracy was improved by 2.27%, 2.31%, 0.74%, and 2.50% on the respective datasets, confirming the model's effectiveness and broad applicability, other metrics showed similar improvements. In addition, significance analysis, ablation studies, and visualization analysis were conducted, and corresponding clinical integration and rehabilitation protocols were developed to support practical use in healthcare.",Zhao Z; Cao Y; Yu H; Yu H; Huang J,,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2025-07-08,10.1109/jbhi.2025.3587026,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); data(abstract),
40622582,Paragonimiasis in Southeast Asia: A 60-Year Bibliometric Analysis (1963-2023).,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Paragonimiasis is a neglected tropical disease, often mistaken with common respiratory diseases, has resulted in substantial global literature. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive literature specifically focused on paragonimiasis in Southeast Asia (SEA). To address this gap, we conducted a bibliometric assessment to provide an overview of existing literature on this disease.<h4>Methods</h4>A literature search was performed in SCOPUS, with metadata analysis using the Bibliometrix package in R. Network visualization was conducted through VOSViewer 1.6.20. Additionally, country-specific socio-economic data were obtained from the World Bank and correlated with scientific productivity using Spearman's correlation analysis, with a significant level set at p-value < 0.05.<h4>Results</h4>This study revealed that Thailand leads in paragonimiasis research within SEA contributing the most in terms of authors, institutions, and publications, followed by Vietnam and the Philippines. Paragonimus heterotremus emerged as the most highly cited Paragonimus species in the region. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identified three key research clusters: clinical epidemiology, molecular genetics, and immunodiagnostics. The latter has gained significant attention in recent years. Among socio-economic factors, research collaborations were statistically significant in enhancing scientific productivity in paragonimiasis research across SEA.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study underscores the importance of strengthening international collaborations to advance paragonimiasis research. It also highlights immunodiagnostics as a crucial area for future research and policy development.",Rodriguez HM; Angeles JMM,"College of Medicine, University of the Philippines Manila, 547 Pedro Gil Street, Manila, Ermita, 1000, Philippines. hmrodriguez2@up.edu.ph.",Acta parasitologica,2025-07-07,10.1007/s11686-025-01085-0,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Southeast Asia; Paragonimiasis; Immunodiagnostics; Bibliometric Analysis
40641506,Taking a look at your speech: identifying diagnostic status and negative symptoms of psychosis using convolutional neural networks.,"Speech-based indices are promising objective biomarkers for identifying schizophrenia and monitoring symptom burden. Static acoustic features show potential but often overlook time-varying acoustic cues that clinicians naturally evaluate-such as negative symptoms-during clinical interviews. A similar dynamic, unfiltered approach can be applied using speech spectrograms, preserving acoustic-temporal nuances. Here, we investigate if this method has the potential to assist in the determination of diagnostic and symptom severity status. Speech recordings from 319 participants (227 with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 92 healthy controls) were segmented into 10 s fragments of uninterrupted audio (<i>n</i> = 110,246) and transformed into log-Mel spectrograms to preserve both acoustic and temporal features. Participants were partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) datasets without overlap. Modified ResNet-18 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) performed three classification tasks; (1) schizophrenia-spectrum vs healthy controls, within 179 clinically-rated patients, (2) individuals with more severe vs less severe negative symptom burden, and (3) clinically obvious vs subtle blunted affect. Grad-CAM was used to visualize salient regions of the spectrograms that contributed to classification. CNNs distinguished schizophrenia-spectrum participants from healthy controls with 87.8% accuracy (AUC = 0.86). The classifier trained on negative symptom burden performed with somewhat less accuracy (80.5%; AUC = 0.73) but the model detecting blunted affect above a predefined clinical threshold achieved 87.8% accuracy (AUC = 0.79). Importantly, acoustic information contributing to diagnostic classification was distinct from those identifying blunted affect. Grad-CAM visualization indicated that the CNN targeted regions consistent with human speech signals at the utterance level, highlighting clinically relevant vocal patterns. Our results suggest that spectrogram-based CNN analyses of short conversational segments can robustly detect both schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and ascertain burden of negative symptoms. This interpretable framework underscores how time-frequency feature maps of natural speech may facilitate more nuanced tracking and detection of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.",Melshin G; DiMaggio A; Zeramdini N; MacKinley M; Palaniyappan L; Voppel A,"Douglas Research Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC Canada.",NPP - digital psychiatry and neuroscience,2025-07-08,10.1038/s44277-025-00040-1,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Schizophrenia; Diagnostic Markers
40619556,Efficacy and safety of 5-aminolevulinic acid in meningioma resection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) has gained popularity in managing malignant gliomas by improving tumor boundary visualization, enabling more complete resections, and prolonging progression-free survival (PFS). Recent research has expanded its use to meningiomas, encouraged by its consistent effectiveness in highlighting these tumors. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FGS in meningiomas.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies included those with ≥ 4 patients reporting patients with meningioma who underwent FGS using 5-ALA. Key endpoints included positive fluorescence, fluorescence intensity, Simpson grade, and surgical complications.<h4>Results</h4>Data from nine studies, encompassing 361 patients (108 males and 253 females) with a mean age of 59.1 years, were analyzed. A high positive fluorescence rate of 95% (95% CI: 92-98%) was found. Strong fluorescence rate occurred in 81% (95% CI: 65-97%), while weak fluorescence was found in 18% (95% CI: 3-34%). According to the Simpson grading system, 80% (95% CI: 65-95%) achieved grades I and II, while 20% (95% CI: 5-35%) reached grades III and IV. Surgical complications occurred in 10% (95% CI: 2-18%). No complications were directly related to 5-ALA.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study indicates that 5-ALA-guided FGS is safe for meningiomas and improves their Simpson grade, with higher rates of Simpson grades I and II. This underscores the utility of 5-ALA as a valuable tool in the surgical management of meningiomas.<h4>Clinical trial number</h4>Not applicable.",Palavani LB; Müller GC; Nogueira BV; Chen HC; Pereira VG; Belfort Santos M; Pereira AL; Farias CA; Honorato F; Oberman DZ; Silva D,"Max Planck University Center, Indaiatuba, Brazil.",Neurosurgical review,2025-07-07,10.1007/s10143-025-03699-4,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Meningioma; 5-ALA; Aminolevulinic Acid; Fluorescence Guided Surgery
40639013,Advancing 3D idiopathic scoliosis assessment through optical scans and web-based integration - Validation of the ScolioSIM system.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>The ScolioSIM module, a novel addition to the web-based ScolioMedIS system, was developed specifically for comprehensive 3D scoliosis visualization and assessment. It utilizes 3D optical scans of the back surface, 3D coordinates of anatomical landmarks, internal and external spinal alignment data, and a generic spine (GS) 3D model to create patient-specific (PS) 3D spine models and deformity parameters. The aim of this paper is to 1) describe the novel ScolioSIM module for scoliosis assessment and 2) validate the agreement between patient-specific (PS) 3D models and Cobb angles produced by the ScolioSIM in comparison to the gold standard - Cobb angles obtained clinically from biplanar radiographs.<h4>Methods</h4>To generate PS 3D models and deformity parameters, the process includes scanning the patient's back, manually acquiring 3D coordinates of anatomical landmarks and external spinal alignment on the back surface, and determining spinal midline based on X-ray images registered with the surface. Additionally, the process involves uploading the files to ScolioSIM for further analysis, including interpolation, projection, and calculation of spinal deformity parameters, and aligning the GS 3D model to generate the PS 3D model. The deformity parameters are then transferred to ScolioMedIS for inclusion in diagnostic reports alongside the PS 3D spine model. Thirty participants with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) were included in the study, and biplanar EOS radiographs and optical 3D scans were acquired in an upright standing pose using a positioning frame. The study compares Cobb angles generated by ScolioSIM (SCA) with manual assessments on EOS radiographs (MCA) and those computed by sterEOS software (ECA).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 80 curves were measured using ScolioSIM. The mean MCA, ECA, and SCA were 22.8 ± 13.0°, 27.9 ± 13.0°, and 24.9 ± 14.3°, respectively. Results showed excellent correlations between SCA and MCA for the thoracic (r = 0.96, 95 % CI: 0.93 to 0.98), lumbar (r = 0.93, 95 % CI: 0.85 to 0.97), and combined thoracic-lumbar regions (r = 0.93, 95 % CI: 0.90 to 0.96).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study introduces ScolioSIM, a web-based module with an optical scan system for 3D assessment of IS, demonstrating a high correlation of Cobb angle measurements with those from the clinical gold standard. Additionally, ScolioMedIS could facilitate multi-center data collection and collaborative decision-making in the management of adolescents with IS. The key advantage of the ScolioSIM module is its ability to compare examinations across different visits longitudinally. ScolioSIM thus holds the potential for monitoring progression and evaluating treatment outcomes in adolescents with IS.",Ćuković S; Luković V; Zou Y; Kaiser M; Bertsch M; Heidt C; Studer D; Farshad M; Laux C,"ETH Zurich, Institute for Biomechanics, Laboratory for Movement Biomechanics, Gloriastrasse 37/39, 8092, Zurich, Switzerland.

Among them, activated esters of 6-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoronicotinic acid ([<sup>18</sup>F]FNA) have been prepared and successfully employed for <sup>18</sup>F-labeling of diverse biomolecules, including peptides. The utility of [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA as a prosthetic compound has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical settings, including radiopharmaceuticals targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitors. This study aims to evaluate a [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA-conjugated nonapeptide, [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA-N-CooP, for positron emission tomography imaging of intracranial BT12 glioblastoma xenografts in a mouse model. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of including control experiments with prosthetic compound alone when it constitutes a major radiometabolite.<h4>Results</h4>[<sup>18</sup>F]FNA-N-CooP successfully delineated intracranial glioblastoma xenografts yielding a standardized uptake value of 0.21 ± 0.03 (n = 4) and a tumor-to-brain ratio of 1.84 ± 0.29. Ex vivo autoradiography of tumor tissue showed a partial co-localization between radioactivity uptake and the target fatty acid binding protein 3 expression. However, in vivo instability of [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA-N-CooP was observed, with [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA identified as a major radiometabolite. Notably, control studies using [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA alone also visualized tumors, producing a standardized uptake value of 0.90 ± 0.10 (n = 4) and a tumor-to-brain ratio of 1.51 ± 0.08.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Both [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA-N-CooP and [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA enabled PET visualization of human glioblastoma in the mouse model. However, the prominent presence of [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA as radiometabolite complicates the interpretation of [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA-N-CooP PET data, suggesting that the observed radioactivity uptake may primarily originate from [<sup>18</sup>F]FNA and other radiometabolites. Enhancing peptide stability is essential for improving imaging specificity. This study underscores the critical need to assess the imaging contributions of prosthetic groups when they function as significant radiometabolites.",Dillemuth P; Ayo A; Zhuang X; Lövdahl P; Liljenbäck H; Kärnä S; Auchynnikava T; Kunnas J; Ponkamo J; Miner MWG; Rajander J; Rosenholm JM; Roivainen A; Airaksinen AJ; Laakkonen P; Li XG,"Turku PET Centre, University of Turku, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, Turku, FI-20520, Finland.",EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry,2025-07-08,10.1186/s41181-025-00368-1,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Prosthetic group; PET; Fluorine-18; Peptide Radiolabeling; 6-[18F]fluoronicotinic Acid
40632219,ImmunoPET imaging of c-Met using a nanobody-based tracer [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-NOTA-PFCM01 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models and non-human primates.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most prevalent form of pancreatic cancer, with high malignancy and poor prognosis. The cellular mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) is overexpressed in 84% of PDAC and plays a critical role in tumor progression, which is closely associated with poor patient outcomes. In this study, a new <sup>68</sup>Ga-labeled nanobody ([<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-PFCM01) was developed for the visualization of c-Met in PDAC models.<h4>Methods</h4>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data were utilized to assess MET expression and overall survival in patients with different cancers. By immunizing an alpaca with recombinant human c-Met, three clones of nanobodies were screened, and the binding affinity was tested by bio-layer interferometry (BLI). The binding epitope of the nanobodies and c-Met was predicted by AlphaFold3. c-Met expression in human PDAC cell lines was evaluated using western blot, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) chelator was used to label the nanobodies with <sup>68</sup>Ga. PET imaging, semiquantitative uptake, and biodistribution research were carried out in tumor xenografts. Histological staining was performed on tumor tissues to characterize the expression of c-Met. In addition, PET imaging in non-human primates was performed to assess pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the nanobody.<h4>Results</h4>Based on TCGA and GTEx data, MET expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is significantly higher than that in normal tissues (P < 0.001). Patients with high MET expression have lower overall survival rates than those with low MET expression. c-Met expression was the highest in BXPC-3 cells but the lowest in MIA PaCa-2 cells, which were set as the positive and negative models respectively. PFCM01 was screened and selected with an excellent binding property with the K<sub>D</sub> value of 0.16 nM. The radiochemical purity (RCP) of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-PFCM01 was high, with good in vivo and in vitro stability. Semiquantitative analysis of small animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging demonstrated significantly higher tumor uptake in BXPC-3 tumors at 2 h post-injection (2.31 ± 0.02%ID/g) than control groups. Ex vivo biodistribution also showed a high uptake of BXPC-3 tumors (1.90 ± 0.59%ID/g) than others, which was further verified the PET imaging results. Histological staining showed high expression of c-Met in BXPC-3 but low in MIA PaCa-2 tumor tissues. In healthy cynomolgus monkeys, PET imaging revealed rapid renal excretion of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-PFCM01. No significant radioactive uptake was observed in the liver, stomach, intestines, pancreas, or muscles, indicating its favorable pharmacokinetics and translational potential.<h4>Conclusions</h4>[<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-PFCM01 showed a specific and high tumor uptake in c-Met-positive PDAC models, providing a noninvasive method to assess c-Met expression. Besides, it demonstrated good pharmacokinetic characteristics in non-human primates. Therefore, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-PFCM01 provided the potential role as a prospective PET imaging agent for future clinical applications.",Sun X; Yang Q; Song L; Lei Y; Huang W; Chen Z; Qiu Y; Kang L; Wang T,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,2025-07-09,10.1007/s00259-025-07441-6,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),c-Met; Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma; Nanobody; Immunopet
40628650,Activity-Based Tracking of Glycan Turnover in Microbiomes.,"Glycans shape microbiomes in the ocean and the gut, driving key steps in the global carbon cycle and human health. Yet, our ability to track microbial glycan turnover across microbiomes is limited, as identifying active degraders without prior genomic knowledge remains a key challenge. Here, we introduce an activity-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe that enables direct visualization and quantification of glycan metabolism in complex microbial communities. As a proof of concept, we investigated α-mannan degradation, a prominent polysaccharide in algal blooms. Using automated glycan assembly, we synthesized a mannan hexasaccharide bearing a fluorescein-rhodamine FRET pair. The probe was validated using a recombinantly expressed <i>endo</i>-α-mannanase (GH76) from <i>Salegentibacter</i> sp. Hel_I_6. It was shown to function in cell lysates, pure cultures, and complex microbiomes (via plate assays and microscopy). This probe enabled spatiotemporal visualization of in situ α-mannan turnover in a marine microbiome. Glycan FRET probes are versatile tools for tracking glycan degradation across biological scales from single enzymes to microbiomes.",Crawford CJ; Reintjes G; Solanki V; Ricardo MG; Harder J; Amann R; Hehemann JH; Seeberger PH,"Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces, Potsdam 14476, Germany.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2025-07-08,10.1021/jacs.5c07546,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40633899,Clinical efficacy of mixed-reality holographic imaging-based nonsurgical periodontal therapy: A randomized controlled split-mouth study.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This randomized, controlled, split-mouth clinical trial compared the short-term clinical efficacy of mixed-reality holographic imaging-based scaling and root planing (MR-SRP) and conventional SRP (C-SRP) in the treatment of severe periodontitis.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients with generalized stage III periodontitis (grade B or C) were recruited. Using a split-mouth design, the contralateral quadrants were randomly assigned to receive either MR-SRP or C-SRP. The primary outcome measure was the number of sites with both a probing pocket depth (PPD) ≥5 mm and bleeding on probing (BOP). Multivariate multilevel logistic regression models were used to quantify the effects of treatment modality, sex, smoking status, tooth type, site characteristics, and baseline PPD on treatment outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>At the 3-month follow-up, both modalities yielded significant reductions in the number of sites with a PPD ≥5 mm and BOP compared with baseline (p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that MR-SRP treatment (OR = 1.37, p = 0.02), middle site (OR = 1.44, p = 0.03), molar (OR = 0.30, p < 0.01), and baseline PPD (OR = 0.26, p < 0.01) were significantly associated with site healing.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared with C-SRP, the MR-SRP approach demonstrated superior short-term clinical outcomes, likely due to the achieved three-dimensional visualization of periodontal structures.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>Within the limits of the present study, mixed-reality holographic imaging could be a clinically variable adjunct tool for periodontal therapy.

40625260,Surface-engineered nanoprobes for multimodal bioimaging: from molecular design to theranostic integration.,"Bioimaging technologies are indispensable for deciphering cellular dynamics, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic responses. However, conventional agents are limited by photobleaching, poor tissue penetration, and nonspecific distribution. These shortcomings hinder real-time visualization of deep tissues and complex pathologies. Surface-engineered nanoprobes have revolutionized bioimaging and theranostics by addressing these limitations. This review systematically explores the molecular design principles and biomedical applications of these advanced nanoprobes. We highlight several major surface engineering strategies (ligand-mediated targeting, environmental responsiveness, charge engineering, surface coating and core-shell structure) and their applications to high-resolution, dynamic and real-time, multimodal imaging. Finally, we outline future perspectives for surface-engineered nanoprobes, emphasizing critical challenges in clinical translation.

40642262,Buttock Augmentation Using Doppler Ultrasound-guided Cannulation for Patient Safety.,"<h4>Background</h4>Augmentation gluteoplasty performed through autologous fat grafting is a surgical technique that volumizes the buttock and shapes the gluteal region according to the patient's expectations, but it is one of the most dangerous aesthetic surgical procedures due to the high rate of the complication and mortality. The aim of the study was to assess the safety of subcutaneous gluteal fat grafting using ultrasound-guided cannulation.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective study of the clinical outcomes of gluteal augmentation with Doppler ultrasound-assisted fat grafting was conducted. The medical records of 177 patients who underwent gluteal augmentation between February and May 2024 were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>In a sample of 177 patients who received gluteal fat grafting, we found that the visualization of perforating arteries had a median of 9 arteries (interquartile range: 2) per buttock. Distribution by quadrants varied among patients. The use of Doppler ultrasound-guided fat grafting was shown to be safe; related complications included 5 patients with hematomas, 2 with seromas, and 1 with suture dehiscence; no cases of infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or death were reported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Subcutaneous gluteal lipoinjection with Doppler ultrasound indirect vision is a procedure that meets patient safety standards. It allows visualization of the tissue where the fat is grafted, reducing the risk of developing thrombotic events by identifying risk structures such as the intramuscular plane and vascular structures. Achieving a good aesthetic result and a low complication rate requires prior training in the use of ultrasound specifically for gluteal lipoinjection using Doppler.",Reyes LF; Echeverry NG; Aguilar HA; Velasco JM; Ramírez B; Villabona S; Serrano HM; Varela A,"From the Majestic Plastic Surgery, Bogota, Colombia.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

40645478,Head Mounted 3-D HD Display System for Microscopic Surgical Field Observation: An Observational Study. ,"Microscopic surgery poses ergonomic challenges due to the constraints of fixed eyepieces. While monitor-based exoscopes offer alternatives, they may limit immersion and assistant visibility. Head-mounted displays (HMDs) have proposed these constraints. This study evaluated the technical capabilities of a three-dimensional high-definition HMD system during surgical simulation to determine its usability compared with conventional and exoscopic visualization methods. Thirty-five physicians and residents with varying microsurgical experience evaluated three visualization methods: HMD, conventional microscope eyepieces, and a 55"" exoscopic monitor. The evaluation criteria included resolution, immersion, depth perception, ergonomic comfort, peripheral vision, and visual latency. We also measured the effective latency times. HMD ranked between the microscope and exoscope across all evaluation criteria. The microscope was rated highest in resolution, immersion, depth perception, and visual latency. Surgeons with >5 years of practice rated HMD higher than microscopes for ergonomics (p=0.029) and peripheral vision (p=0.009). The measured image latency was approximately 0.093±0.0018 s. Finally, the HMD system showed better operator and assistant participation. While the HMD showed potential for ergonomic benefit and enhanced peripheral engagement, further development is needed, particularly regarding image quality and magnification. Given that clinical integration in this preliminary study was limited to observation, further development is needed, including larger numbers of cases and diverse operative settings, including primary surgeons, assistants, scrub nurses, and surgical observers.",Nounaka Y; Matano F; Umeoka K; Kubota A; Matsumoto N; Higuchi T; Umezawa H; Matsunobu T; Kitamura T; Nakae R; Yokobori S; Murai Y; Igarashi Y,"Department of Neurological Surgery, Nippon Medical School Hospital, Tokyo, 113-8602 Japan.

40644716,Efficacy and safety of local and general anesthesia for diagnostic cerebral angiography in children.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of diagnostic cerebral angiography in children under local anesthesia (LA) versus general anesthesia (GA).<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study included children who underwent diagnostic cerebral angiography between September 2018 and September 2021. Medical records were reviewed to identify eligible patients and assign them to the LA or GA group. Baseline demographics, procedural metrics, medical expenses, image quality, pain scores, vital signs (mean arterial pressure and partial oxygen pressure), and complications were compared between the groups.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 128 children (mean age 10.38 ± 2.28 years; 56 [43.8%] males) underwent diagnostic cerebral angiography. The LA and GA groups comprised 40 and 88 children, respectively. No significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics, contrast agent volume, fluoroscopy time, radiation exposure, scanning duration, image vascular contrast and integrity, diagnostic efficacy, length of hospital stay, and pain scores between the groups (p > 0.05). Although the LA group had significantly shorter anesthesia duration, postanesthesia care unit stay, and lower medical expenses, this group exhibited more motion artifacts and poorer image clarity compared with the GA group (p < 0.05). In addition, the mean arterial pressure decreased in both groups during the procedure. Complications included inguinal hematoma in both groups, whereas skin rash, headache, and vomiting occurred only in the general anesthesia group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Diagnostic cerebral angiography under LA can safely be used to obtain images with comparable visualization of vascular contrast and integrity and diagnostic yield to those obtained under general anesthesia. Notably, local anesthesia offers the advantages of shorter anesthesia duration and reduced healthcare costs.",Gao W; Xu F; Wu X; Yu Z; Liang P,"1Department of Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Child Neurodevelopment and Cognitive Disorders, Chongqing, China; and.",Journal of neurosurgery.

It includes respiratory-triggered T2-weighted sequences and, when available, ultra-short TE (UTE) sequences. Emerging techniques such as ventilation-perfusion MRI and real-time MRI are also discussed.<h4>Results</h4>Most clinical questions can be addressed using respiratory-triggered T2-weighted sequences. UTE sequences improve visualization of aerated lung parenchyma and low-proton lesions. Real-time MRI significantly reduces motion artifacts and enables functional assessment, especially in unsedated infants and toddlers. Total exam time is 15-20 min.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Pediatric lung MRI is a reliable, radiation-free alternative to CT in many cases.

40624471,"Idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms, and neuroretinitis (IRVAN) syndrome: a comprehensive literature review of a rare retinal vasculopathy.","Idiopathic Retinal Vasculitis, Aneurysms, and Neuroretinitis (IRVAN) syndrome is a rare retinal vasculopathy predominantly affecting young individuals. Characterized by retinal vasculitis, aneurysmal dilations, exudation, and neuroretinitis, IRVAN was initially considered a benign condition. However, emerging evidence highlights its potential for severe vision-threatening complications, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis and intervention. The underlying pathogenesis remains unclear, though inflammatory, vascular, and neuroretinal mechanisms are implicated. While most insights stem from case reports and small cohort studies, IRVAN's clinical presentation varies widely. Affected individuals often experience sudden vision loss, typically due to macular involvement, retinal ischemia, or neovascular complications. Imaging techniques, including fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, are essential for diagnosis, allowing detailed visualization of aneurysmal changes and ischemic progression. Recent discussions have proposed a reclassification of neuroretinitis within the disease framework, suggesting alternative nomenclature emphasizing its vascular pathology. Management strategies focus on reducing ischemia and inflammation. Panretinal laser photocoagulation is the cornerstone of therapy, aiming to mitigate neovascular complications. Corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologic therapies play roles in controlling inflammatory components. Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (Anti-VEGF) treatments have shown promise, particularly in advanced disease stages. Despite these therapeutic options, IRVAN's unpredictable course necessitates individualized treatment approaches. Although primarily an ocular condition, isolated reports suggest possible systemic associations, including intracranial hypertension and autoimmune markers. Future research should aim to establish standardized diagnostic criteria and therapeutic protocols, enhancing outcomes for affected individuals. This review synthesizes current literature to provide insights into clinical presentation, imaging features, differential diagnoses, and evolving management strategies for this rare disorder.",Asaad H; Hasan R,"Faculty of Medicine, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria. drhaidaraasaad@gmail.com.",BMC ophthalmology,2025-07-07,10.1186/s12886-025-04236-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Irvan Syndrome; Retinal Vasculitis; Aneurysmal Dilations; Inflammatory Retinal Disease
40631568,"Perceptions of Modernized Anatomy Teaching Tools and Methods: A Mixed Method Study Among Medical, Nursing Students and Faculty.","Anatomy education is fundamental for medical and nursing students. There is a growing shift toward modern tools such as 3D applications, virtual dissection tables, and plastinated cadavers. This mixed-methods study at VinUniversity explored perceptions of these innovations. The quantitative component involved surveys of 142 students (131 medical, 11 nursing), achieving a 77.2% response rate, and the qualitative component included semi-structured interviews with all 12 anatomy faculty and nine students across cohorts, offering diverse insights into their experiences. The findings show that students value interactive tools for enhanced visualization and engagement, particularly the Complete Anatomy app and plastinated cadavers. Nursing students reported greater satisfaction with digital resources than did medical students (4.55 ± 0.69 vs. 4.04 ± 0.77, p = 0.026). Traditional lectures received lower ratings (3.44 ± 1.16 for medical vs. 4.45 ± 0.69 for nursing, p = 0.003). Students also emphasized the value of problem-based discussions (3.83 ± 1.05 for medical vs. 4.36 ± 0.81 for nursing, p = 0.10) and perceived anatomy as highly relevant to future practice (4.32 ± 0.92). Challenges included difficulty in applying digital anatomy to clinical scenarios, software crashes, and limited access. Faculty cited time constraints, insufficient institutional support, and the steep learning curve for integrating new tools. Many relied on self-directed learning, resulting in inconsistent implementation. Also, limited human resources hampered the efficiency of hands-on sessions. To optimize anatomy education, institutions should establish structured faculty training, improve technical infrastructure, and align curricula with innovative methods. A hybrid model combining digital tools with cadaveric dissection could offer the most comprehensive approach. Addressing these barriers can enhance learning outcomes and faculty engagement, especially in resource-limited settings. Future studies should explore long-term effects on student performance, clinical competence, and optimal integration strategies.",Nguyen QT; Hoang DM; Tran DLD; Tran KH; Pham DP; Ha TM,"College of Health Sciences, VinUniversity, Hanoi, Vietnam.","Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)",2025-07-09,10.1002/ca.70000,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Medical education; clinical anatomy; Medical Students; Faculty Development; Anatomy Education; Virtual Dissection; Plastinated Cadavers
40636539,Trends and Developments in Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus Research.,"<h4>Background</h4>Despite the prevalence of vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) as a chronic skin disease in clinical settings, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive bibliometric analysis summarizing the existing literature on this topic. The aim of this study is to offer clinicians, researchers, and other interested parties an up-to-date overview of the research status and emerging trends in VLS through the use of bibliometric analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>The present research employed a thorough examination of the Web of Science Core Collection to identify publications pertaining to VLS within the time frame of January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2023. A total of 1698 publications were scrutinized utilizing Microsoft Excel software and various visualization tools, including CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Pajek, to discern specific characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>The current research encompassed a total of 1,698 articles pertaining to VLS. The analysis of citation bursts and co-citation patterns has revealed a high level of confidence in the effectiveness and safety of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of VLS, establishing them as the preferred primary treatment for this condition. Since 2018, there has been a significant increase in VLS publications, with the United States and United Kingdom emerging as leading contributors. Research has moved from examining past pathological changes like ""epidermal atrophy"" to focusing on ""long-term treatment management,"" and improving ""quality of life"". The exact mechanism of VLS remains unclear, but it is linked to cytokine immune regulation, oxidative stress, and potential epigenetic changes or genetic mutations in susceptible individuals.

40622188,Combined therapy with microwave ablation and conventional transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma tumors larger than five centimetres: a prospective study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of a combined therapy involving microwave ablation (MWA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) versus only TACE for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors ≥5 cm.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective study enrolled 186 patients with HCC tumors ≥5 cm. Patients were divided into a test group (TACE + MWA) and a control group (TACE only). The average tumor size was 9.2 ± 3.7 cm, ranging from 5 to 19 cm. Forty-five patients (27.4%) had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer class A disease, and 119 (72.6%) had class B disease. The viable tumor volume was quantified utilizing ITK-SNAP, a free and open-source software package for medical image segmentation and visualization, along with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The tumor response was assessed according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors rules. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were monitored, and the tumor necrosis ratio and AFP variation rate were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>The final analysis of 164 patients (median age 57 years, range 26-80 years; 19 women, 145 men) showed that the test group exhibited a significantly higher tumor necrosis ratio than the control group (87.5% vs. 76.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.002). The serum AFP levels were markedly reduced in the test group relative to the control group 30 days after surgery (<i>P</i> = 0.001). The AFP variation rate in the test group (79.5%) was significantly greater than that observed in the control group (47.5%) (<i>P</i> < 0.001). A significant positive correlation existed between the tumor necrosis ratio and AFP variation rate (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Compared with the control group, the test group demonstrated a significantly higher partial response rate (68.6% vs. 51.3%, <i>P</i> < 0.05), a lower rate of progressive disease (17.4% vs. 35.9%, <i>P</i> < 0.05), an increased overall response rate (70.9% vs. 55.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.036), and an enhanced disease control rate (82.6% vs. 64.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.007). Post-MWA, 3 patients experienced hemorrhage and 2 developed arteriovenous fistulae, all of which were treated with embolization.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The combination of TACE and MWA demonstrated safety, good tolerability, and greater efficacy compared with TACE alone for HCC tumors ≥5 cm.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>The combination of TACE and MWA offers new possibilities for improving tumor necrosis rates, reducing AFP levels, and enhancing short-term prognosis.

40630811,Deep Gluteal Pain Syndrome: Technical Description of the Endoscopic Approach and Anatomical Considerations.,"<h4>Background</h4>Fibrovascular bands are currently considered the most relevant cause of deep gluteal pain syndrome, according to various reports<sup>1-6</sup>. This condition often exists concurrently with hypertrophic bursae in the peritrochanteric space due to the same inflammatory process because of the anatomical continuity between both spaces<sup>7-10</sup>. In such cases, we perform bursectomy of the lateral space and resection of fibrovascular bands in the posterior space. Our technique has shown good results, without requiring a piriformis tenotomy<sup>11</sup>. In the present video article, we demonstrate our endoscopic technique with modified portals, which addresses both spaces providing complete management of the pathology.<h4>Description</h4>The patient is placed in the supine position with the operative limb placed freely on the operative field for easy manipulation. The distance between the anterior and posterior borders of the greater trochanter at the level of the vastus tuberosity is demarcated. This distance is projected lengthwise onto the posterior third of the femur, delineating the proximal posterolateral accessory (PPLA) and distal posterolateral accessory (DPLA) portals. Under direct visualization, the DPLA portal is made, followed by the PPLA portal. A wide bursectomy in the peritrochanteric space is performed, followed by a partial tenotomy of the distal insertion of the gluteus maximus. Once in the subgluteal space, fibrovascular adhesions in the piriformis branch of the inferior gluteal artery are carefully released. Once the nerve has been identified, resection of the fibrovascular bands is performed in the subgluteal space, and the recovery of epineural circulation and free excursion of the nerve are evaluated.<h4>Alternatives</h4>Nonoperative treatment is a valid alternative as the initial management of deep gluteal pain syndrome. If there is a poor response to nonoperative treatment or a chronic pathology of both compartments, surgical treatment should be considered. Open procedures have been described, which are more invasive and could generate a greater inflammatory response<sup>3</sup>. Several reports have described the difficulty of endoscopic treatment in both the peritrochanteric and subgluteal spaces, which necessitates the use of accessory portals for management of hypertrophic bursae and release of the sciatic nerve<sup>12,14,17,18</sup>. Routine piriformis tenotomy has also been described for use alongside resection of fibrovascular bands<sup>4,12-16</sup>.<h4>Rationale</h4>This endoscopic technique allows access to the peritrochanteric and subgluteal spaces through 2 portals. The locations of, and method for, using these portals have been previously established in cadaveric studies. We observed the presence of fibrovascular bands in all of the specimens under study. In our medium-term clinical study, resection of the fibrosis from the lateral to the posterior compartment without performing a piriformis tenotomy resulted in recovery of the epineural circulation of the sciatic nerve and its free excursion in all patients, with good to excellent results and no recurrences<sup>11</sup>.<h4>Expected outcomes</h4>Previous studies have focused on similar procedures performed via different endoscopic portals, exclusively accessing the subgluteal space with or without a piriformis tenotomy<sup>6,13-16</sup>. We performed a study of 57 patients who underwent endoscopic treatment of an inflammatory pathology in both compartments and resection of fibrovascular bands without piriformis tenotomy. Patients showed improved modified Harris Hip (mHHS), International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12), and visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and 70% of patients had good to excellent results at a mean follow-up of almost 2 years<sup>11</sup>.<h4>Important tips</h4>The procedure must be performed by an experienced surgeon.The distal portal must be located proximal to the distal insertion of the gluteus maximus to aid in performing the posterior partial tenotomy.Extensive bursectomy should be performed in the peritrochanteric space.The sciatic nerve should be identified, and extensive resection of the fibrovascular bands and inflammatory bursae should be performed in the subgluteal space.Take care not to damage the piriformis branch of the inferior gluteal artery.An assisting surgeon should maintain control of the extremity throughout the procedure.Do not perform epineurolysis, which has been associated with poor clinical results.Observe the recovery of perineural circulation and free excursion of the sciatic nerve.<h4>Acronyms and abbreviations</h4>PPLA = proximal posterolateral accessoryDPLA = distal posterolateral accessoryMRI = magnetic resonance imagingASIS = anterior superior iliac spineVT = vastus tuberosityIQR = interquartile rangemHHS = modified Harris Hip ScoreiHOT-12 = International Hip Outcome ToolVAS = visual analog scale.",Tobar C; Bravo JT; Villegas D; Parodi D,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Clínica RedSalud Providencia, Santiago, Chile.",JBJS essential surgical techniques,2025-07-08,10.2106/jbjs.st.23.00035,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
39466606,Specialty-Based Ambulatory Quality Improvement Program: A Specialty-Specific Ambulatory Metric Project.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Healthcare is increasingly being delivered in the outpatient setting, but robust quality improvement programs and performance metrics are lacking in ambulatory care, particularly specialty-based ambulatory care.<h4>Methods</h4>To promote quality improvement in ambulatory care, we developed an infrastructure to create specialty-specific quality measures and dashboards that could be used to display providers' performance across relevant measures to individual providers and institutional leaders.<h4>Results</h4>The products of this program include a governance and infrastructure for specialty-specific ambulatory quality metrics as well as two distinct dashboards for data display. One dashboard is provider-facing, displaying provider's performance on specialty-specific measures as compared to institutional standards. The second dashboard is a leadership dashboard that provides overall and provider-level information on performance across measures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Specialty-based Ambulatory Quality program reflects a systematic, institutionally-supported quality improvement framework that can be applied across diverse ambulatory specialties. As next steps, we plan to evaluate the program's impact on provider performance across measures and expand this program to other specialties practicing in the outpatient setting.",Nagler AR; Testa PA; Cho I; Ogedegbe G; Kalkut G; Gossett DR,"Author Affiliations: The Ronald O.

40619870,Dust-borne emerging contaminants: an underrecognized risk factor for non-communicable diseases in older Chinese adults.,"Given global aging and the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), identifying environmental risk factors in older adults is critical. This study investigated the associations between dust-borne emerging contaminant (EC) exposures and several high-incidence NCDs in older adults. 137 province-level dust measurements of microplastics, liquid crystal monomers, organophosphate esters, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances across 23 provinces were used to estimate exposure levels for 14 466 Chinese participants (mean age 84.7). Propensity score-adjusted logistic regression showed significantly higher odds of NCDs at the third <i>vs.</i> first tertile of specific exposure, including hypertension [polyethylene terephthalates: odds ratio (OR), 1.28; 95% confidence interval (CI), (1.16-1.41), <i>etc.</i>], heart disease [perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>12</sub>): 1.25 (1.04-1.49), <i>etc.</i>], cataract [organophosphate triesters: 1.61 (1.32-1.96), <i>etc.</i>], stroke [polycarbonates: 1.30 (1.06-1.58), <i>etc.</i>], respiratory diseases [organophosphate triesters: 1.57 (1.27-1.94), <i>etc.</i>], and arthritis [PFCAs (C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>12</sub>): 1.73 (1.34-2.24), <i>etc.</i>]. G-computation estimated 6-13% absolute increases in disease probability (∼60-130 additional cases per 1000) from low- to high-exposure scenarios. Subgroup analyses suggested stronger associations among females, the oldest participants, and eastern residents. These pilot findings demonstrate dust-borne ECs as an underrecognized health risk for older adults and warrant further investigation. Adopting precautionary principles prevents studies and regulations from remaining confined to criteria air pollutants.

40629183,"Bibliometric insights into the cell cycle, aging, and metabolism: from molecular mechanisms to clinical implications.","Cell cycle regulation, aging, and metabolism are pivotal biological processes linked to both normal physiology and disease development. Understanding their interplay is crucial for advancing gerontological research and clinical oncology. We analyzed articles and reviews on the cell cycle, aging, and metabolism from 2004 to 2023 using the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric tools, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace, were applied to visualize collaboration networks, geographic distributions, and thematic clusters. Our analysis of 698 papers highlights a growing interest in the intersection of all three of these topics, with a notable publication surge from 2019 to 2022. The United States and China emerged as leading contributors, with significant international collaborations. Research themes evolved around molecular mechanisms, oxidative stress, and the implications for neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Furthermore, keyword analysis identified five key clusters: neurodegenerative biomarkers, oxidative damage, cell cycle disruptions in cancer, epigenetic links between aging and cancer, and metabolic stress responses. Notably, metabolic shifts associated with aging influence both cellular repair mechanisms and the onset of senescence, indicating a transition from macroscopic changes to microscopic molecular alterations. This bibliometric study systematically maps the scholarly output on the cell cycle, aging, and metabolism, and our findings underscore the importance of molecular and genetic research in understanding the complex interactions and highlight their translational potential in oncology. Future research should explore personalized tumor treatment strategies based on individual cell cycle dynamics and genetic profiling.",Pan Y; Liu H; Chen J; Deng H; Yang C; Huang Y; Cai Q; Huang W; Huang M; Xiong S; Liu H; Huang L; Huang H; Liang W; He J,"Department of Thoracic Surgery and Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, No. 151, Yanjiang Road, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China.",Biogerontology,2025-07-08,10.1007/s10522-025-10271-6,1.0,visual(abstract),Aging; Metabolism; Cell cycle; Cellular senescence; Bibliometric Analysis
