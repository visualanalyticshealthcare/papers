40045095,Generalizable deep learning framework for 3D medical image segmentation using limited training data.,"Medical image segmentation is a critical component in a wide range of clinical applications, enabling the identification and delineation of anatomical structures. This study focuses on segmentation of anatomical structures for 3D printing, virtual surgery planning, and advanced visualization such as virtual or augmented reality. Manual segmentation methods are labor-intensive and can be subjective, leading to inter-observer variability. Machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning models, have gained traction for automating the process and are now considered state-of-the-art. However, deep-learning methods typically demand large datasets for fine-tuning and powerful graphics cards, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained settings. In this paper we introduce a robust deep learning framework for 3D medical segmentation that achieves high performance across a range of medical segmentation tasks, even when trained on a small number of subjects. This approach overcomes the need for extensive data and heavy GPU resources, facilitating adoption within healthcare systems. The potential is exemplified through six different clinical applications involving orthopedics, orbital segmentation, mandible CT, cardiac CT, fetal MRI and lung CT. Notably, a small set of hyper-parameters and augmentation settings produced segmentations with an average Dice score of 92% (SD = ±0.06) across a diverse range of organs and tissues.",Ekman T; Barakat A; Heiberg E,"Department of Medical Imaging and Physiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. tobias.ekman88@gmail.com.",3D printing in medicine,2025-03-06,10.1186/s41205-025-00254-1,8.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw); machine learning(kw,abstract); data(title,abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Segmentation; Machine Learning; 3D Printing; Deep Learning
40038307,Breast cancer prediction based on gene expression data using interpretable machine learning techniques.,"Breast cancer remains a global health burden, with an increase in deaths related to this particular cancer. Accurately predicting and diagnosing breast cancer is important for treatment development and survival of patients. This study aimed to accurately predict breast cancer using a dataset comprising 1208 observations and 3602 genes. The study employed feature selection techniques to identify the most influential predictive genes for breast cancer using machine learning (ML) models. The study used K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), random forests (RF), and a support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, the study employed feature- and model-based importance and explainable ML methods, including Shapley values, Partial dependency (PDPS), and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots, to explain the genes' importance ranking from the ML methods. Shapley values highlighted the significance of some of the genes in predicting cancer presence. Model-based feature ranking techniques, particularly the Leaving-One-Covariate-In (LOCI) method, identified the ten most critical genes for predicting tumor cases. The LOCI rankings from the SVM and RF methods were aligned. Additionally, visualization methods such as PDPS and ALE plots demonstrated how individual feature changes affect predictions and interactions with other genes. By combining feature selection techniques and explainable ML methods, this study has demonstrated the interpretability and reliability of machine learning models for breast cancer prediction, emphasizing the importance of incorporating explainable ML approaches for medical decision-making.",Kallah-Dagadu G; Mohammed M; Nasejje JB; Mchunu NN; Twabi HS; Batidzirai JM; Singini GC; Nevhungoni P; Maposa I,"Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana.",Scientific reports,2025-03-04,10.1038/s41598-025-85323-5,8.4,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(title,abstract)",Prediction; Breast cancer; Machine Learning; Interpretable Machine Learning
40053759,Building and Developing a Tool (PANDEM-2 Dashboard) to Strengthen Pandemic Management: Participatory Design Study. ,"The COVID-19 pandemic exposed challenges in pandemic management, particularly in real-time data sharing and effective decision-making. Data protection concerns and the lack of data interoperability and standardization hindered the collection, analysis, and interpretation of critical information. Effective data visualization and customization are essential to facilitate decision-making. This study describes the development of the PANDEM-2 dashboard, a system providing a standardized and interactive platform for decision-making in pandemic management. It outlines the participatory approaches used to involve expert end users in its development and addresses key considerations of privacy, data protection, and ethical and social issues. Development was informed by a review of 25 publicly available COVID-19 dashboards, leading to the creation of a visualization catalog. User requirements were gathered through workshops and consultations with 20 experts from various health care and public health professions in 13 European Union countries. These were further refined by mapping variables and indicators required to fulfill the identified needs. Through a participatory design process, end users interacted with a preprototype platform, explored potential interface designs, and provided feedback to refine the system's components. Potential privacy, data protection, and ethical and social risks associated with the technology, along with mitigation strategies, were identified through an iterative impact assessment. Key variables incorporated into the PANDEM-2 dashboard included case rates, number of deaths, mortality rates, hospital resources, hospital admissions, testing, contact tracing, and vaccination uptake. Cases, deaths, and vaccination uptake were prioritized as the most relevant and readily available variables. However, data gaps, particularly in contact tracing and mortality rates, highlighted the need for better data collection and reporting mechanisms. User feedback emphasized the importance of diverse data visualization formats combining different data types, as well as analyzing data across various time frames. Users also expressed interest in generating custom visualizations and reports, especially on the impact of government interventions. Participants noted challenges in data reporting, such as inconsistencies in reporting levels, time intervals, the need for standardization between member states, and General Data Protection Regulation concerns for data sharing. Identified risks included ethical concerns (accessibility, user autonomy, responsible use, transparency, and accountability), privacy and data protection (security and access controls and data reidentification), and social issues (unintentional bias, data quality and accuracy, dependency on technology, and collaborative development). Mitigation measures focused on designing user-friendly interfaces, implementing robust security protocols, and promoting cross-member state collaboration. The PANDEM-2 dashboard provides an adaptable, user-friendly platform for pandemic preparedness and response. Our findings highlight the critical role of data interoperability, cross-border collaboration, and custom IT tools in strengthening future health crisis management. They also offer valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities in developing IT solutions to support pandemic preparedness.",Tighe C; Ngongalah L; Sentís A; Orchard F; Pacurar GA; Hayes C; Hayes JS; Toader A; Connolly MA,"Insight, SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, University of Galway, Galway, Ireland.",JMIR public health and surveillance,2025-03-05,10.2196/52119,6.9,"visualization(abstract); dashboard(title,abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract)",
40053788,Testing a Dashboard Intervention for Tracking Digital Social Media Activity in Clinical Care of Individuals With Mood and Anxiety Disorders: Protocol and Design Considerations for a Pragmatic Randomized Trial. ,"Mood and anxiety disorders are prevalent mental health diagnoses. Numerous studies have shown that measurement-based care, which is used to monitor patient symptoms, functioning, and treatment progress and help guide clinical decisions and collaboration on treatment goals, can improve outcomes in patients with these disorders. Including digital information regarding patients' electronic communications and social media activity is an innovative approach to augmenting measurement-based care. Recent data indicate interest and willingness from both mental health clinicians and patients to share this type of digital information in treatment sessions. However, the clinical benefit of systematically doing this has been minimally evaluated. This study aims to develop an electronic dashboard for tracking patients' digital social activity and a protocol for a pragmatic randomized trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of using the dashboard in real-world clinical care of patients with depression or anxiety disorders. We developed a personalized electronic dashboard that tracks patients' electronic communications and social media activity, visualizes data on these interactions through key graphics and figures, and provides a tool that can be readily integrated into routine clinical care for use by clinicians and patients during treatment sessions. We then designed a randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the electronic dashboard in real-world care compared to treatment as usual. The trial included patients aged ≥12 years with a mood or anxiety disorder who were receiving treatment in outpatient psychiatry clinics in the Johns Hopkins Health System and the Kennedy Krieger Institute. The primary outcome includes changes in patient-rated depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes include changes in patient-rated anxiety symptoms and overall functioning. Exploratory analyses examine the impact of the intervention on measures of therapeutic alliance and the detection of clinically actionable targets. We successfully developed an electronic dashboard for tracking patients' electronic communications and social media activity, and we implemented a protocol for evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of using the dashboard in routine care for mood or anxiety disorders. The protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. In this study, we report the technological, ethical, and pragmatic considerations in developing the dashboard and testing it in a real-world setting. The integration of an electronic dashboard to monitor digital social activity in mental health care treatment is novel. This study examines the feasibility and effectiveness of the dashboard and the challenges in implementing this protocol. The lessons learned from developing and implementing the study will inform ongoing discussions about the value of gathering collateral information on patients' digital social activity and how to do so in a way that is acceptable and clinically effective.

39928123,MetaAnalysisOnline.com: Web-Based Tool for the Rapid Meta-Analysis of Clinical and Epidemiological Studies.,"<h4>Background</h4>A meta-analysis is a quantitative, formal study design in epidemiology and clinical medicine that systematically integrates and quantitatively synthesizes findings from multiple independent studies. This approach not only enhances statistical power but also enables the exploration of effects across diverse populations and helps resolve controversies arising from conflicting studies.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to develop and implement a user-friendly tool for conducting meta-analyses, addressing the need for an accessible platform that simplifies the complex statistical procedures required for evidence synthesis while maintaining methodological rigor.<h4>Methods</h4>The platform available at MetaAnalysisOnline.com enables comprehensive meta-analyses through an intuitive web interface, requiring no programming expertise or command-line operations. The system accommodates diverse data types including binary (total and event numbers), continuous (mean and SD), and time-to-event data (hazard rates with CIs), while implementing both fixed-effect and random-effect models using established statistical approaches such as DerSimonian-Laird, Mantel-Haenszel, and inverse variance methods for effect size estimation and heterogeneity assessment.<h4>Results</h4>In addition to statistical tests, graphical representations including the forest plot, the funnel plot, and the z score plot can be drawn. A forest plot is highly effective in illustrating heterogeneity and pooled results. The risk of publication bias can be revealed by a funnel plot. A z score plot provides a visual assessment of whether more research is needed to establish a reliable conclusion. All the discussed models and visualization options are integrated into the registration-free web-based portal. Leveraging MetaAnalysisOnline.com's capabilities, we examined treatment-related adverse events in patients with cancer receiving perioperative anti-PD-1 immunotherapy through a systematic review encompassing 10 studies with 8099 total participants. Meta-analysis revealed that anti-PD-1 therapy doubled the risk of adverse events (risk ratio 2.15, 95% CI 1.39-3.32), with significant between-study heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=95%) and publication bias detected through the Egger test (P=.02). While these findings suggest increased toxicity associated with anti-PD-1 treatment, the z score analysis indicated that additional studies are needed for definitive conclusions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, the web-based tool aims to bridge the void for clinical and life science researchers by offering a user-friendly alternative for the swift and reproducible meta-analysis of clinical and epidemiological trials.",Fekete JT; Győrffy B,"Department of Bioinformatics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-03-06,10.2196/64016,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Pharmacology; Treatment; Statistics; epidemiology; Random effect model; Clinical Trial; Response Rate; Funnel Plot; Fixed Effect Model; Hazard Rate; Z Score Plot
40053710,Daily Treatment Monitoring for Patients Receiving Home-Based Peritoneal Dialysis and Prediction of Heart Failure Risk: mHealth Tool Development and Modeling Study. ,"Peritoneal dialysis is one of the major renal replacement modalities for patients with end-stage renal disease. Heart failure is a common adverse event among patients who undergo peritoneal dialysis treatment, especially for those who undergo continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis at home, because of the lack of professional input-output volume monitoring and management during treatment. This study aims to develop novel mobile health (mHealth) tools to improve the quality of home-based continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis treatment and to build a prediction model of heart failure based on the system's daily treatment monitoring data. The mHealth tools with a 4-layer system were designed and developed using Spring Boot, MyBatis Plus, MySQL, and Redis as backend technology stack, and Vue, Element User Interface, and WeChat Mini Program as front-end technology stack. Patients were recruited to use the tool during daily peritoneal dialysis treatment from January 1, 2017, to April 20, 2023. Logistic regression models based on real-time treatment monitoring data were used for heart failure prediction. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Youden index were calculated to evaluate the performance of the prediction model. In the sensitivity analysis, the ratio of patients with and without heart failure was set to 1:4 and 1:10, respectively, to better evaluate the stability of the prediction model. A WeChat Mini Program named Futou Bao for patients and a patient data management platform for doctors was developed. Futou Bao included an intelligent data upload function module and an auxiliary function module. The doctor's data management platform consisted of 4 function modules, that is, patient management, data visualization and marking, data statistics, and system management. During the study period, the records of 6635 patients who received peritoneal dialysis treatment were uploaded in Futou Bao, with 0.71% (47/6635) of them experiencing heart failure. The prediction model that included sex, age, and diastolic blood pressure was considered as the optimal model, wherein the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Youden index were 0.75, 0.91, 0.89, and 0.66, respectively, with an area under the curve value of 0.879 (95% CI 0.772-0.986) using the validation dataset. The sensitivity analysis showed stable results. This study provides a new home-based peritoneal dialysis management paradigm that enables the daily monitoring and early warning of heart failure risk.

40047946,Novel Techniques in Antenatal Imaging of Spinal Dysraphisms.,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>This review examines the imaging techniques for diagnosing spinal dysraphisms (SD), focusing on advancements in prenatal detection.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Prenatal ultrasound (US) is the first-line tool for detecting spinal dysraphisms, including myelomeningocele. While US is effective for early detection, it has limitations in fully characterizing defects, particularly due to factors like fetal positioning. To address these, advanced techniques such as 3D ultrasound and AI-driven algorithms have improved diagnostic accuracy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains critical for a comprehensive evaluation, providing detailed visualization of soft tissue anomalies and assessing lesion severity. Prenatal ultrasound is essential for initial screening but often complemented by MRI for a thorough diagnosis.

40044669,Monitoring mRNA vaccine antigen expression in vivo using PET/CT.,"Noninvasive visualization of the distribution and persistence of mRNA vaccine antigen expression in mammalian systems has implications for the development and evaluation of future mRNA vaccines. Here, we genetically fuse E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) to the delta furin diproline modified SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S2P<sup>∆f</sup>) mRNA vaccine and image its expression in female mice and male non-human primates using [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoropropyl-trimethoprim ([<sup>18</sup>F]FP-TMP). Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging revealed transient expression of the vaccine antigen in the injection site and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Fusion of eDHFR did not impact S2P immunogenicity and no humoral or cellular immune response was detected against eDHFR in either species. In this work, we show that eDHFR can be used as an mRNA-encoded PET reporter gene to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of mRNA vaccine antigen expression in vivo. This technique could be applied in clinical translation of future mRNA vaccines or therapeutics.",Blizard GS; Dwivedi G; Pan YG; Hou C; Etersque JM; Said H; Chevrier A; Lavertu M; Ni H; Davis B; Tam Y; Cao Q; Mach RH; Weissman D; Alameh MG; Sellmyer MA,"Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.",Nature communications,2025-03-06,10.1038/s41467-025-57446-w,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

Further, to evaluate its feasibility and initial clinical use for the treatment of cervical cancer patients with a High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy system. SolidWorks, Computer Aided design software was used for the design of the intracavitary brachytherapy applicator. Hewlett-Packard Jet Fusion 4200 was used for printing different parts of applicators with Polyamide12 (PA12) material. Radiograph and CT images of printed material parts were taken in the air and water medium to see the visualization. Before use in the patient, necessary quality assurance tests were carried out by coupling it with a microSelectron HDR machine. X-ray markers were used to visualize the source path inside the uterine and vaginal tandems. Physical and clinical evaluations were performed with a prototype 3D-printed applicator to check its suitability for clinical use. Final Applicator design was created from multiple hit and trial methods in SolidWorks. Printed PA12 of ovoid parts having a mean Hounsfield unit (HU) value of - 75 HU. Quality tests on the PA12 intracavitary applicator performed with the microSelectron HDR brachytherapy machine were passed. The chances of uterine perforation were less due to the semi-rigidity of the PA12 applicator. The newly designed T-O-based applicator and dummy marker do not produce any artifacts on the CT images.

40051384,Development of a deep learning-based model to evaluate changes during radiotherapy using cervical cancer digital pathology.,"This study aims to create a deep learning-based classification model for cervical cancer biopsy before and during radiotherapy, visualize the results on whole slide images (WSIs), and explore the clinical significance of obtained features. This study included 95 patients with cervical cancer who received radiotherapy between April 2013 and December 2020. Hematoxylin-eosin stained biopsies were digitized to WSIs and divided into small tiles. Our model adopted the feature extractor of DenseNet121 and the classifier of the support vector machine. About 12 400 tiles were used for training the model and 6000 tiles for testing. The model performance was assessed on a per-tile and per-WSI basis. The resultant probability was defined as radiotherapy status probability (RSP) and its color map was visualized on WSIs. Survival analysis was performed to examine the clinical significance of the RSP. In the test set, the trained model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 per-tile and 0.95 per-WSI. In visualization, the model focused on viable tumor components and stroma in tumor biopsies. While survival analysis failed to show the prognostic impact of RSP during treatment, cases with low RSP at diagnosis had prolonged overall survival compared to those with high RSP (P = 0.045). In conclusion, we successfully developed a model to classify biopsies before and during radiotherapy and visualized the result on slide images. Low RSP cases before treatment had a better prognosis, suggesting that tumor morphologic features obtained using the model may be useful for predicting prognosis.",Goto M; Futamura Y; Makishima H; Saito T; Sakamoto N; Iijima T; Tamaki Y; Okumura T; Sakurai T; Sakurai H,"Department of Radiation Oncology & Proton Medical Research Center, Institute of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 2-1-1 Amakubo, Tsubuka, Ibaraki 305-8576, Japan.",Journal of radiation research,2025-03-07,10.1093/jrr/rraf004,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cervical cancer; Radiation Therapy; Digital Pathology; Deep Learning
40051000,Magnetic anchors with line-guided endoscopic full-thickness resection for gastric submucosal tumors. ,"The advantage of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is the ability to achieve high R0 resection and a low local recurrence rate (Oyama in Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am 24:201-212, 2014;Cai et al. in Gastrointest Endosc 88:160-167, 2018;). Endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) compensates for the deficiency of ESD, and it can treat more ailments (Aslanian et al. in VideoGIE 4:343-350, 2019). However, due to the requirements of EFTR for endoscopic resection experience and defect closure skills, the operation is relatively difficult, which is the greatest obstacle to the widespread clinical use of EFTR (Chu and Xu in Am J Gastroenterol 115:1972-1973, 2020). Here, we propose a useful method-a magnetic anchor with line guidance (MALG-EFTR). In addition, the device provides satisfactory tissue tension within the submucosa, facilitates visualization of the dissection plane, strengthens counter traction, and reduces the difficulty of surgery during EFTR. MALG-EFTR can effectively prevent the magnetic anchor from falling off or remaining in the abdominal cavity or digestive tract, which facilitates the recovery of specimens. Therefore, this technique might reduce procedure time and increase the stabilization and safety of operations.",Zhang X; Wang H; He C; Xiao Z; Zhang Y; Qu B,"Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, Heilongjiang, China. zxyzxyhyd@sina.com.",European journal of medical research,2025-03-06,10.1186/s40001-025-02408-7,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40053502,ADP-MoA-Pa: a platform for screening antibiotic activity and their mechanism of action in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses a significant threat to global public health. To address this crisis, there is an urgent need to identify and characterize novel antibacterial molecules. This study aimed to develop the ADP-MoA-Pa platform to facilitate the discovery of new antibiotics and provide preliminary insights into their mechanisms of action (MoA). The ADP-MoA-Pa platform enables the simultaneous visualization of antibiotic activity (growth inhibition) alongside one of three classic mechanisms of action in P. aeruginosa: DNA damage/inhibition of DNA replication, protein synthesis inhibition, or cell wall damage. To construct the platform, the promoter regions of recA, ampC and armZ of P. aeruginosa PA14 strain were each amplified and fused to a promoterless luxCDABE operon in vector pUC18T-mini-Tn7T-lux-Gm. The constructs were electrotransformed into strain PA14 where they integrated in the chromosome. Each promoter fusion was activated by the expected antibiotics on plates and in liquid media, thereby demonstrating proof of concept. The armZ:: luxCDABE fusion responded to protein synthesis inhibitors such as macrolides, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, and aminoglycosides. The ampC:: luxCDABE fusion was induced by β-lactams, while the recA:: luxCDABE fusion was activated by quinolones and nitrofurantoin. Interestingly, under some conditions, ciprofloxacin also activated ampC and armZ, though to a lesser extent. The ADP-MoA-Pa platform is a low-cost, readily implementable tool with significant potential for high-throughput screening of antimicrobials. It offers a promising avenue for identifying and characterizing novel antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacterial species, contributing to the global effort to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens.",Morante EYV; Nunes VA; Chambergo FS; Spira B,"Departamento de Microbiologia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.",Journal of applied microbiology,2025-03-07,10.1093/jambio/lxaf058,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

On this basis, multiple sets of LAMP primers were designed for the adenovirus hexon gene as the detection target. Optimal primer combinations were further screened, and the composition of the reagent system and amplification procedures were improved to achieve efficient amplification. To realize an instrument-independent, fast-testing strategy, by combining NALF, which is based on the principle of lateral chromatography, small molecule antigens were modified for primers. Moreover, amplification products were bound to the corresponding antibodies on nucleic acid chromatography test strips for visualization. Finally, a series of tests were performed to validate the sensitivity, specificity, and methodological consistency of the LAMP-NALF assay. <i>Results</i>: Adenovirus infections in children in this region during this period were mainly caused by serotype 3. The optimal amplification temperature for optimal primers of LAMP was 65 °C. The combination of LAMP and NALF could detect femtogram-grade positive plasmid of the hexon gene; besides, there was no cross-reactivity with five other types of common respiratory pathogens in children. The agreement between the LAMP-NALF assay and tNGS/qPCR for detecting the adenovirus in 100 respiratory clinical specimens was 98%. <i>Conclusion</i>: The combination of LAMP and NALF can achieve rapid, convenient and accurate detection of human adenovirus type 3, which can provide a powerful support for the pathogenic diagnosis of adenoviral infections in children, thus contributing to the promotion of the development of point-of-care testing for pathogens.",Yun Q; Xia WH; Ma SF; Lu DM; Gu M; Zhu AS,"Changzhou Children's Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, 213003, China. yunqiwork@126.com.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,2025-03-06,10.1039/d4ay01973c,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40043189,A mixed methods protocol for an impact and implementation evaluation of the Pharmacy First Services for management of common conditions in England.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>In response to high levels of demand for primary medical services in England, characterized by longer appointment waiting times and delayed referrals, the Government developed its National Health Service (NHS) Primary Care Recovery Plan. A key component of the plan is Pharmacy First (PF), which involves participating community pharmacies supplying prescription-only medicine after consultation with a pharmacist for seven common conditions: earache, uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women, sore throat, sinusitis, impetigo, shingles, and infected insect bites. The study aims to evaluate the implementation of the PF service and its impact on the volume of prescribing, case mix of General Practitioner consultations, accident and emergency department and other hospital use, equity of access, and cost for different groups of patients in different contexts, as well as its acceptability and fidelity.<h4>Methods</h4>A 36-month, mixed methods evaluation with five elements, namely evidence synthesis, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, quantitative analysis of impacts before and after implementation (e.g. using interrupted time series analysis) using routine data, and an economic evaluation. Findings will be synthesized and interpreted using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research supplemented by Proctor's Implementation Outcomes Framework.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The evaluation should have service level, policy, professional, and research impact both in England and beyond. This includes generating evidence to show: whether PF contributes to improving primary healthcare access, assessing the quality of antimicrobial use, identifying the scope for refinements to PF, and, overall, informing better implementation of PF. The findings will also provide robust evidence to enable policymakers to determine how to enhance the role of community pharmacy in England in the future. Furthermore, the evaluation will develop a data dashboard, and the methods and codes used to interrogate it (though not the patient data), will be made publicly available that could support other similar evaluations in England and internationally.",Glover RE; Lalani M; Sonnex K; Allen T; Anderson C; Ashiru-Oredope D; Avery A; Coupland C; Elliott R; Goulding J; Higgins H; Johnson S; Mackenna B; Muller-Pebody B; O'Neill S; Pacho A; Taylor A; Thornley T; Mays N,"Department of Health Service Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, 15-17 Tavistock Place, London WC1H 9SH, United Kingdom.",The International journal of pharmacy practice,2025-03-05,10.1093/ijpp/riaf004,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),England; Community Pharmacy; Mixed Methods; Policy Evaluation
