40493647,mindLAMPVis as a Co-Designed Clinician-Facing Data Visualization Portal to Integrate Clinical Observations From Digital Phenotyping in Schizophrenia: User-Centered Design Process and Pilot Implementation.,"<h4>Background</h4>The potential of digital mental health to transform care delivery in low- and middle-income countries is well established. However, there remains the need to clinically and organically adapt current tools to local needs. This paper explores the process of creating a novel data visualization system for a digital mental health app and outlines the necessary steps in the process. This work demonstrates co-design involving collaboration between teams across geographies and disciplines based on clinicians' requirements.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to co-design a visualization dashboard app for clinicians through a design study with a multidisciplinary team consisting of clinicians in Boston and Bangalore, mindLAMP software developers in Boston, and computer scientists with visualization expertise in Bangalore. The app is designed to visualize derivatives of both active and passive data of patients with schizophrenia to support the research contexts of digital psychiatry clinics in India.<h4>Methods</h4>The mindLAMP app, already used in many countries today, is adapted to offer a new clinician-facing data visualization portal, mindLAMPVis. The novel web-based portal is designed to improve clinical integration for use in India. After building the new portal, the insights from this new portal are corroborated with known clinical observations of relapse using comparative visualization. The data were taken from the mindLAMP app and processed using multivariate analysis and dimensionality reduction to make it easy and manageable for clinicians to analyze. These techniques are integrated in mindLAMPVis, thus making it a locally co-designed, developed, and deployed tool. A feasibility study of the pilot implementation of the app was completed through a domain expert study with clinician-driven case studies.<h4>Results</h4>To assess the system, we preloaded data from 24 patients with schizophrenia, including those with relapses. Through case examples focusing on relapse risk prediction in schizophrenia, mindLAMPVis is used to identify different visualization methods to compare different analytical results for each patient. In partnership with clinicians for co-designing the app, we explored the feasibility of a comparative visualization tool for discovering patterns across different time stamps for a single patient or any patterns across patients related to the relapse episode. As an example of reverse translation, mindLAMPVis offers new features that complement the original features of mindLAMP, highlighting the mutual benefit of software adaptation and collaborative design.<h4>Conclusions</h4>mindLAMPVis is a tailored tool designed for use in India, but it can aid in identifying and comparing behavioral patterns that may indicate clinical risk for patients in any country. mindLAMPVis offers an example of how, through technical design, feedback, and real-world clinical testing, it is feasible to adapt current software tools to meet local needs and even exceed the use cases of the original technology. mindLAMPVis also successfully incorporates both active and passive digital phenotyping data.",Sama K; Sreevalsan-Nair J; Choudhary S; Nagendra S; Reddy PV; Cohen A; Mehta UM; Torous J,"Graphics-Visualization-Computing Lab, International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT-B), 26/C Electronics City, Hosur Road, Bangalore, 560100, India, 91 80 4140 7777, 91 80 4140 7704.",JMIR formative research,2025-06-10,10.2196/70073,18.3,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); dashboard(kw,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Schizophrenia; Mobile phone; Data Visualization; Dimensionality Reduction; Anomaly Detection; Co-design; Digital Phenotyping; Browser-based Dashboard; Local Technology Adoption; Multivariate Data Mining
40491260,Actionable Wearables Data for the Neurology Clinic: A Proof-of-Concept Tool.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Wearable devices can monitor key health and fitness domains. In multiple sclerosis (MS), monitoring step count and sleep is feasible, valid, and offers a holistic glimpse of patient functioning and worsening. However, data generated from wearables are typically unavailable at the point of care. We describe the design, development, and evaluation of a proof-of-concept tool that delivers patient-generated wearables data in accessible, interpretable, and actionable formats to an outpatient Neurology clinic.<h4>Methods</h4>Through a process of human-centered design, stakeholders were engaged to create a technological solution to access and display wearables data via a launch from the electronic health record (EHR). Designs were informed by patient-centered observational research and clinician interviews to ensure user alignment and validity. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations (Health ITUES framework) as well as live observations of use assessed functionality, ease of use, and clinical integration.<h4>Results</h4>During development, 25 clinicians and four engineers across eight clinical settings provided feedback. The proof-of-concept wearable selected was Fitbit, which was connected via a custom solution to the EHR dashboard (BRIDGE). In the final validation, clinician satisfaction was high: mean scores > 4/5 for all performance and ease of use components. Live visualizations during clinical encounters highlighted a range of potential uses: detecting progression by step count, setting motivating and realistic activity goals despite limitations, referring to rehabilitation after activity drops, and measuring effects of interventions on sleep quality.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Integrating wearables data into a clinical workflow for neurology is feasible and highlights novel areas to support shared decision-making and data-driven, personalized care.",Miller N; Chinedu-Eneh E; Wijangco J; Henderson K; Sisodia N; Sara N; Reihm J; Poole S; Rowson J; Guo CY; Gelfand JM; Block VJ; Bove R,"Department of Neurology, UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, San Francisco, California, USA.",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,2025-06-09,10.1002/acn3.70082,11.8,"visualization(kw,abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(kw,abstract); data(title,abstract); electronic health record(abstract)",Sleep; Fitbit; Wearables; Visualizations; Steps/activity
40493115,Artificial intelligence and endoanal ultrasound: pioneering automated differentiation of benign anal and sphincter lesions.,"<h4>Background</h4>Anal injuries, such as lacerations and fissures, are challenging to diagnose because of their anatomical complexity. Endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) has proven to be a reliable tool for detailed visualization of anal structures but relies on expert interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) may offer a solution for more accurate and consistent diagnoses. This study aims to develop and test a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm for automatic classification of fissures and anal lacerations (internal and external) on EUAS.<h4>Methods</h4>A single-center retrospective study analyzed 238 EUAS radial probe exams (April 2022-January 2024), categorizing 4528 frames into fissures (516), external lacerations (2174), and internal lacerations (1838), following validation by three experts. Data was split 80% for training and 20% for testing. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.<h4>Results</h4>For external lacerations, the CNN achieved 82.5% sensitivity, 93.5% specificity, and 88.2% accuracy. For internal lacerations, achieved 91.7% sensitivity, 85.9% specificity, and 88.2% accuracy. For anal fissures, achieved 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This first EUAS AI-assisted model for differentiating benign anal injuries demonstrates excellent diagnostic performance. It highlights AI's potential to improve accuracy, reduce reliance on expertise, and support broader clinical adoption. While currently limited by small dataset and single-center scope, this work represents a significant step towards integrating AI in proctology.",Mascarenhas M; Almeida MJ; Martins M; Mendes F; Mota J; Cardoso P; Mendes B; Ferreira J; Macedo G; Poças C,"Department of Gastroenterology, Precision Medicine Unit, São João University Hospital, 4200-427, Porto, Portugal. miguelmascarenhassaraiva@gmail.com.",Techniques in coloproctology,2025-06-10,10.1007/s10151-025-03160-0,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Anal fissure; Endoanal Ultrasound; Anal Laceration
40512392,Exploring supportive care needs of lung cancer patients in China and predicting with machine learning models.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aims to explore the level of supportive care needs among hospitalized lung cancer patients in China, explore the key influencing factors and use machine learning (ML) to develop predictive models for the level of supportive care needs among hospitalized lung cancer patients.<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional study collected data on the supportive care needs, demographics, and clinical information of 486 hospitalized lung cancer patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with these needs. Predictive models were developed using six machine learning methods-logistic regression, linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, random forest, and adaptive boosting-to assess their performance, followed by a visualization of feature importance. The code used for model development and analysis is publicly available at https://github.com/zimengcc/predict_cancer_scn.<h4>Results</h4>Among the factors influencing the supportive care needs of hospitalized lung cancer patients, age, education level, occupation, tumor stage, and household per capita monthly income have a significant impact on supportive care needs scores. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that education level and household per capita monthly income were statistically significant predictors of supportive care needs scores. In the predictive tasks, the random forest model performed the best, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.45 for predicting the total supportive care needs score. Furthermore, to predict the dimension with the highest level of supportive care needs, the model achieved an accuracy of 88. 42%, an F1 score of 87. 49%, and an ROC-AUC of 0.9061.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study explored the factors influencing the level of supportive care needs among hospitalized lung cancer patients. While the machine learning models demonstrate promising predictive performance, it is important to note that all results were derived solely through cross-validation. Therefore, potential overfitting and overestimation of model performance should be considered when interpreting these findings. Nevertheless, these models may serve as a foundation for developing tools to support personalized care planning in clinical settings.",Chen Z; Qiu S; Luo C; Zeng J; Huang B; Zheng J,"The Seventh Clinical Medicine College of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518100, China.",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2025-06-13,10.1007/s00520-025-09619-y,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Lung cancer; Machine Learning; Supportive Care Needs

40511508,High-Fidelity 3D Imaging of Dental Scenes Using Gaussian Splatting.,"Three-dimensional visualization is increasingly used in dentistry for diagnostics, education, and treatment design. The accurate replication of geometry and color is crucial for these applications. Image-based rendering, which uses 2-dimensional photos to generate photo-realistic 3-dimensional representations, provides an affordable and practical option, aiding both regular and remote health care. This study explores an advanced novel view synthesis (NVS) method called Gaussian splatting (GS), a differentiable image-based rendering approach, to assess its feasibility for dental scene capturing. The rendering quality and resource usage were compared with representative NVS methods. In addition, the linear measurement trueness of extracted craniofacial meshes was evaluated against a commercial facial scanner and 3 smartphone facial scanning apps, while teeth meshes were assessed against 2 intraoral scanners and a desktop scanner. GS-based representation demonstrated superior rendering quality, achieving the highest visual quality, fastest rendering speed, and lowest resource usage. The craniofacial measurements showed similar trueness to commercial facial scanners. The dental measurements had larger deviations than intraoral and desktop scanners did, although all deviations remained within clinically acceptable limits. The GS-based representation shows great potential for developing a convenient and cost-effective method of capturing dental scenes, offering a balance between color fidelity and trueness suitable for clinical applications.",Jin CX; Li MX; Yu H; Gao Y; Guo YP; Xia GS; Huang C,"Department of Prosthodontics, State Key Laboratory of Oral & Maxillofacial Reconstruction and Regeneration, Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine Ministry of Education, Hubei Key Laboratory of Stomatology, School and Hospital of Stomatolog, Wuhan University, China.",Journal of dental research,2025-06-13,10.1177/00220345251332201,6.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw); machine learning(kw),Artificial intelligence; Reconstruction; Dimensional Change; Digital Imaging/radiology; Deep Learning/machine Learning; Computer Vision/convolutional Neural Networks
40499046,Microenvironment-Activatable Long-Wavelength NIR-II Visualization and Synergistic Treatment of Pulmonary Embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening thrombotic condition, yet its precise diagnosis and effective treatment remain a major clinical challenge. In this study, we report the development of a microenvironment-activatable nanoplatform that enables hypoxia-triggered long-wavelength second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging for accurate thrombus visualization, combined with photothermal therapy (PTT) and controlled hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) release for synergistic therapeutic intervention. We first synthesize an <i>N</i>-oxide-based molecular probe that undergoes hypoxia-induced structural transition, thereby activating both NIR-II fluorescence and photothermal properties. This probe, together with a thermosensitive H<sub>2</sub>S donor, is encapsulated into nanoparticles, which are further functionalized with bis-serotonin groups to achieve thrombus-specific targeting via the myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide-mediated aggregation. In a PE mouse model, the nanoagent enables highly selective and sensitive visualization of thrombi via activatable NIR-II fluorescence imaging after intravenous injection, achieving a remarkable signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 120. The combined PTT and H<sub>2</sub>S therapy significantly enhance thrombolytic efficacy compared to conventional treatment (e.g., urokinase). Importantly, the nanoagent exhibits excellent biocompatibility in vivo, with minimal risk of hemorrhagic complications. This high-performance hypoxia-responsive platform offers a promising strategy for the precise diagnosis and effective treatment of PE and other cardiovascular diseases.",Meng X; Song J; Du Z; Tao Y; Qi J,"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Responses, and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.",ACS nano,2025-06-11,10.1021/acsnano.5c07280,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Hypoxia; Pulmonary embolism; Activatable Probe; Second Near-infrared; Synergistic Treatment
40495596,Comparative analysis of choriocapillaris visualization across various optical coherence tomography systems.,"PurposeTo evaluate the variability in choriocapillaris (CC) blood flow measurements across different optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) systems.MethodsA cross-sectional study with 13 healthy volunteers (10 females, 26 [24;27] years). Central 3 × 3 mm OCTA were obtained using: HRA + OCT Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering; DRI OCT Triton, Topcon (software versions IMAGEnet 6 1.36 and 1.38); Mocean 4000, Moptim; Avanti RTVue-XR, Optovue; Solix, Optovue; Revo NX130, Optopol Technology. CC flow parameters (flow deficit (FD) number, FD density, and mean FD area) were analysed using the Phansalkar method. Binarization windows and FD thresholds were calculated individually for each device.ResultsOCTA images exhibited significant variability in FD number (F(6, 85) = 8.062, <i>p</i> < 0.001), FD density (F(6, 99) = 3.957, <i>p</i> = 0.028), and mean FD area (F(6, 99) = 58.936, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Strong correlation was found only between Avanti and DRI OCT Triton (ver. 1.38) for FD number (<i>r</i> = 0.955, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and FD density (<i>r</i> = 0.912, <i>p</i> = 0.033).

40517099,Enhanced visualization of colonic polyps using a fluorophore-conjugated claudin-1 antibody in a CPC-APC mouse model.,"<h4>Background</h4>Early detection and removal of polyps for primary colon cancer prevention during colonoscopy are still fraught with significant miss rates. In the current study, we determined the ability of claudin-1 (CLDN1) antibodies conjugated to near-infrared fluorophores to target and visualize colonic polyps with high resolution in the CPC-APC mouse colonic polyp model.<h4>Methods</h4>CPC-APC mice that developed distal colon polyps at 12 weeks of age were used in the present study. The formation of polyps was confirmed by mouse colonoscopy using the ColoView system (Karl Stortz). For polyp labeling, anti-CLDN1 and control immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were conjugated to IRDye800 and 50, 100, and 150 μg doses were administered intravenouly to CPC-APC mice. Mice were sacrificed at different time points, and colons were harvested for imaging using the LI-COR Pearl Small Animal Imaging System. Polyp-to-background fluorescence intensity ratios (PBRs) were calculated for each polyp. Histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on the polyps.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 9 mice were used in the experiment, with a total of 45 polyps analyzed. The presence of observed polyps on gross examination was confirmed via histology. CLDN1-IRDye800 had a PBR of 7.6 ± 3.9, which was significantly higher than the nonspecific IgG-IRDye800 control (P =.0428). CLDN1-IRDye800 was further analyzed and overall had a similar range of PBR with 50, 100, and 150 μg injections at 72 h and had a statistically significant higher PBR of 8.9 ± 4.2 than the IgG-IRDye800 control (P =.0184) at 150 μg. Adenomatous polyps as small as 1 mm could be identified using CLDN1-IRDye800. Hematoxylin and eosin staining confirmed adenomatous polyps with high-grade dysplasia, and IHC confirmed the expression of CLDN1.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CLDN1-IRDye800 enabled polyp visualization with ultrahigh-resolution fluorescence imaging technology in CPC-APC mice. Polyps as small as 1 mm could be visualized, indicating clinical potential to overcome the current limitations of colonic polyp detection.",Liu S; Cox KE; Amirfakhri S; Jaiswal S; Talib S; Primeaux M; Jih LJ; Singh SK; Pisegna JR; Mohs AM; Hoffman RM; Batra SK; Dhawan P; Bouvet M,"Department of Surgery, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,2025-06-13,10.1016/j.gassur.2025.102103,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Tumor marker; fluorescence imaging; Colon Polyps; Cpc-apc Mouse Model; Claudin-1 Fluorophore Antibody

40506030,Lumbar spinal stenosis: current concept of management.,"Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common degenerative spinal condition where spinal canal narrowing causes symptoms such as neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, and lower back pain. While non-operative and surgical approaches yield similar long-term outcomes, surgical intervention-particularly decompression-can provide earlier symptom relief, functional recovery, and fall prevention in selected patients with refractory symptoms. Recent advancements in surgical technologies and image guidance have brought about a paradigm shift in LSS management. Biportal endoscopic spine surgery (BESS) has gained global traction as a minimally invasive alternative to traditional decompression methods, offering superior visualization, less soft tissue damage, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery. High-quality studies, including randomized controlled trials, have shown promising outcomes for this technique. Furthermore, the integration of navigation systems, robot-assisted instrumentation, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostics and surgical planning tools is transforming spinal surgery by enhancing precision in preoperative evaluation and intraoperative execution. These innovations enable accurate targeting, reduce complications, and improve reproducibility across diverse surgical settings. This review provides an updated overview of LSS, covering its pathophysiology, clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Special emphasis is placed on the growing role of BESS and the transformative impact of digital technologies such as navigation, robotics, and AI in the evolving landscape of spinal stenosis care.",Kwon JW; Suk KS; Moon SH; Park SY; Kim N; Park SR; Shin JW; Kim HS; Lee BH,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.",Asian spine journal,2025-06-13,10.31616/asj.2025.0198,5.5,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Lumbar spinal stenosis; Robotics; Navigation; Biportal Endoscopic Spine Surgery
40511682,Artificial intelligence approaches for tumor phenotype stratification from single-cell transcriptomic data.,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with robust computational analysis facilitates the characterization of phenotypic heterogeneity within tumors. Current scRNA-seq analysis pipelines are capable of identifying a myriad of malignant and non-malignant cell subtypes from single-cell profiling of tumors. However, given the extent of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, it is challenging to assess the risk associated with individual cell subpopulations, primarily due to the complexity of the cancer phenotype space and the lack of clinical annotations associated with tumor scRNA-seq studies. To this end, we introduce SCellBOW, a scRNA-seq analysis framework inspired by document embedding techniques from the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). SCellBOW is a novel computational approach that facilitates effective identification and high-quality visualization of single-cell subpopulations. We compared SCellBOW with existing best practice methods for its ability to precisely represent phenotypically divergent cell types across multiple scRNA-seq datasets, including our in-house generated human splenocyte and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) dataset. For tumor cells, SCellBOW estimates the relative risk associated with each cluster and stratifies them based on their aggressiveness. This is achieved by simulating how the presence or absence of a specific cell subpopulation influences disease prognosis. Using SCellBOW, we identified a hitherto unknown and pervasive AR-/NE<sub>low</sub> (androgen-receptor-negative, neuroendocrine-low) malignant subpopulation in metastatic prostate cancer with conspicuously high aggressiveness. Overall, the risk-stratification capabilities of SCellBOW hold promise for formulating tailored therapeutic interventions by identifying clinically relevant tumor subpopulations and their impact on prognosis.",Bhattacharya N; Rockstroh A; Deshpande SS; Thomas SK; Yadav A; Goswami C; Chawla S; Solomon P; Fourgeux C; Ahuja G; Hollier B; Kumar H; Roquilly A; Poschmann J; Lehman M; Nelson CC; Sengupta D,"Australian Prostate Cancer Research Centre-Queensland, Faculty of Health, School of Biomedical Sciences, Centre for Genomics and Personalised Health, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.",eLife,2025-06-13,10.7554/elife.98469,5.4,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(title); data(title,abstract)",Human; systems biology; computational biology; marker-free; Risk stratification; prostate cancer; Transfer Learning; Language Model; Single-cell Rna-seq
40499368,Multivariate multi-horizon time-series forecasting for real-time patient monitoring based on cascaded fine tuning of attention-based models.,"The real-time forecasting of critical physiological indicators in intensive care units (ICUs) is essential for early intervention and clinical decision support. This study introduces a novel framework, StreamHealth Multi-Horizon AI, which has been designed to perform multivariate, multi-horizon time-series forecasting for vital signs, specifically for a person's blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2) and respiratory rate (RR). The framework leverages advanced attention-based models, with a particular emphasis on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and we benchmark its performance against classical deep learning architectures, including LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, CNN, and Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models with and without attention mechanisms. Both univariate and multivariate forecasting tasks are explored across multiple prediction horizons (i.e., 7, 15 and 25 min), using physiological time-series data from the MIMIC-III database. The proposed system incorporates a cascaded fine-tuning strategy, wherein the TFT model is sequentially fine-tuned on individual patients' data, significantly enhancing the model's generalizability to unseen patient profiles. Empirical results demonstrate that the TFT model consistently outperforms baseline models across all forecasting settings, achieving lower RMSE and MAE values, and exhibiting superior capacity for capturing long-sequence dependencies and temporal feature dynamics. To validate its applicability in real-time clinical environments, the framework integrates a simulated streaming infrastructure using Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, enabling continuous data ingestion, forecasting, and visualization of vital signs. This end-to-end deployment underscores the system's potential for ICU monitoring, allowing clinicians to anticipate patient deterioration proactively. In summary, we introduce a comprehensive framework that uniquely integrates TFT with cascaded fine-tuning for multivariate, multi-horizon forecasting of critical ICU indicators. Additionally, we demonstrate a simulation for a real-time deployment pipeline using Kafka and Flink, enabling robust and generalizable ICU monitoring in clinical settings.

40504884,Early Use of a Risk-Adjusted Mechanical Ventilation Digital Quality Measure Bundle in a Large Health System.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To describe the development, validation, and deployment of a risk-adjusted digital quality measure (dQM) bundle for spontaneous awakening trials (SATs), spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), and low-tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) as part of a quality improvement (QI) program in a large health system.<h4>Design</h4>Quasi-experimental before-after study.<h4>Setting</h4>Thirty-seven ICUs across 14 hospitals in the United States.<h4>Patients</h4>Mechanically ventilated patients older than 16 years.<h4>Interventions</h4>An available, open-source, hospital mortality model, a new gradient-boosted ICU mortality model, and four new, heterogenous, stacked ensemble predicted duration of mechanical ventilation (DMV) models (one model predicting up to 14 d of ventilation [14-d DMV model] and three multiple classifier models predicting up to 6 d of ventilation) were created. A regularly refreshing dashboard displaying risk-adjusted information was coupled with audit and feedback sessions for ICU leadership beginning in September 2020.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Risk model performance was evaluated, as appropriate, with C-statistics, mean se (MSE), concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs), and F1-scores. Across all ICUs, compliance with SBTs improved from 81 to 97%, LTVV 80 to 90%, and SATs 27 to 65%. Both hospital and ICU mortality models had robust performance, with C-statistics of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84-0.85) and 0.94 (0.93-0.94), respectively. The 14-day DMV model MSE was 0.63 and CCC was 0.97, whereas the multiple classifier DMV models F1-scores ranged from 0.42 to 0.59. Unadjusted DMV was greater post-implementation (4.32 ± 3.99 d) vs. pre-implementation (3.76 ± 3.66 d). Actual vs. predicted ventilator days were stable pre-implementation vs. post-implementation when assessed with the multiple classifier models and decreased in the post-implementation period when assessed with the 14-day model. Risk-adjusted mortality remained stable.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A dQM bundle proved useful for efficiently tracking process measures related to a ventilator management QI program in a large health system, although risk-adjusted information differed depending on model constructs.

Because PFAS include thousands of structurally diverse chemicals, there is a pressing need for identifying what data are available to assess the human health hazard of these compounds.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used systematic evidence map (SEM) methods to summarize the available epidemiological and mammalian bioassay evidence for ∿14,735 chemicals identified as PFAS by EPA's Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE). This work is a continuation of our previous 2022 and 2024 SEMs that inventoried evidence on a separate set of ∿500 PFAS. The Comprehensive PFAS Dashboard includes evidence identified from our past SEMs and completed EPA assessments.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted literature searches from peer-reviewed and gray literature sources to identify, screen, and inventory mammalian bioassay and epidemiological literature. A combination of manual review and machine learning software were utilized. A diverse array of potentially relevant supplemental content was also tracked, including mechanistic data, exposure-only studies, and studies informing chemical toxicokinetics and clearance. For each study meeting predefined population, exposure, comparator, and outcome (PECO) criteria, experimental design details and health endpoints evaluated were summarized in interactive web-based literature inventory visuals. Epidemiology studies and animal bioassay studies with ≥21-day exposure duration or reproductive/developmental study design proceeded to undergo a study evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity, as well as detailed extraction of health endpoint data. Underlying data are publicly available and can be downloaded.<h4>Results</h4>Scientific database searches retrieved 152,205 references. After full-text screening, there were 347 mammalian bioassay and 44 epidemiological studies that met PECO criteria. The mammalian bioassay and epidemiological evidence assessed 99 and 30 individual PFAS, respectively (n = 18 PFAS with both). The epidemiological evidence assessed 15 health systems and the mammalian bioassay evidence assessed 16 health systems.<h4>Discussion</h4>Results from our 2022 and 2024 SEMs and completed EPA assessments are compiled into Comprehensive PFAS Dashboard. This dashboard is a resource for better understanding the currently available PFAS human health hazard data. It can be used as a tool for researchers and regulators interested in PFAS data gaps and research needs. Across all the data sources compiled into the Comprehensive PFAS Dashboard, only 1.4% (214/14,735) of PFAS had any mammalian bioassay or epidemiological data available. The vast majority of PFAS lack publicly available information about the potential human health effects of exposure to these chemicals.. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP16952.",Shirke AV; Radke EG; Jones R; Allen BD; Lin CJ; Ross A; Vetter N; Lemeris C; Hartman P; Eftim S; Varghese A; Blain R; Hubbard H; Williams AJ; Thayer KA; Carlson LM,"1Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, Chemical and Pollutant Assessment Division (CPAD), U.S. EPA, Washington, District of Columbia, USA.",Environmental health perspectives,2025-06-12,10.1289/ehp16952,4.0,dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(abstract),
40506306,Socket shield technique in implant dentistry: An AI-based bibliometric analysis.,"<h4>Statement of problem</h4>The socket shield technique (SST) has become an innovative approach to dental implant placement and is aimed at preserving facial bone integrity and enhancing esthetic outcomes. Despite its increasing adoption, comprehensive bibliometric analyses specific to the SST are lacking.<h4>Purpose</h4>The purpose of this study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of research into the SST using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools to map the scientific landscape and identify emerging trends, influential authors, and key research areas.<h4>Material and methods</h4>The study was conducted using a metadata search query to identify relevant SST articles published in the Scopus database from 2010 to 2024. AI-assisted screening and automated metadata extraction via the Scopus API facilitated data collection. A manual verification process was conducted by domain experts to refine and validate AI-selected articles. Bibliometric analysis was performed using the R bibliometrix package and visualization tools such as VOS Viewer and Python to examine publication trends, citation patterns, and co-authorship networks.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 157 articles were identified, with publication output showing a steady increase, particularly after 2015. The bibliometric analysis identified the leading contributors in terms of publication count and authorship influence. The United States led in overall publication volume and collaborative international publications, whereas China produced the most single-country publications. Germany had the highest total citations, as well as the highest average article citations. Early conceptual work continued to have a lasting impact on subsequent research. The International Journal of Periodontics and Restorative Dentistry published the largest number of articles related to SST.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The bibliometric analysis demonstrates that SST research is growing rapidly, with significant contributions from both the academic and clinical sectors.

40503633,Study of micro-signals: proposed analysis methodology based on data from the Lille Poison Control and Toxicovigilance Center.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>This project aimed to enhance the Lille Poison Control and Toxicovigilance Center health surveillance and proactive response to intoxication-related issues by integrating a micro-signal analysis methodology.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a methodology employing Poisson distribution and historical limits to identify unusual signals marked by significant variations, often obscured by case age, continuous information flow (due to the 24/7 operational nature of the service), or team rotations. A severity score was created to prioritize micro-signals based on case seriousness to facilitate rapid and appropriate interventions. Additionally, a dashboard was developed to visualize detected micro-signals as a heat map, improving accessibility and decision-making for poison center professionals.<h4>Results</h4>Testing the methodology with historical Lille Poison Control and Toxicovigilance Center data demonstrated its viability and the medical relevance of the severity score calculations. It highlighted the effect of national measures on the use of an anxiolytic that had not been detected by the teams at the time. In addition, when the values returned by the severity score are interpreted by class of substance, rather than individually, similar orders of magnitude are observed (e.g., mushrooms, anxiolytics in our case study).<h4>Discussion</h4>Our approach shows potential for improving patient care and responsiveness in toxicovigilance, particularly within the French Lille Poison Control and Toxicovigilance Center network. One limitation of the current dashboard is that it only carries out analysis by product. Future enhancements include the integration of a thesaurus which will also allow analysis by class.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study integrated a micro-signal analysis method into a health surveillance system to detect hidden trends in poison center data, improving emergency response and substance management.",Lurant T; Garat A; Nemesien E; Nisse P; Azzouz R; Zitouni D,"Université de Lille, IMT Lille Douai, Université d'Artois, Junia Hauts-de-France, ULR 4515, Laboratoire de Génie Civil et géo-Environnement (LGCgE), Lille, France.","Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2025-06-12,10.1080/15563650.2025.2512822,3.8,"dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",Poisson distribution; Poison Center; Severity Score; Toxicovigilance; Emergency Alert; Historical Limits; Micro-signal Detection
40513916,Geographic Disparities in Glucagon Prescriptions Across North Carolina.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Geographic disparities in healthcare access cause substantial difficulties for patients with diabetes, particularly in accessing emergency medicines such as glucagon. In this study, we examine the spatial distribution of glucagon, insulin, and sulfonylureas prescription claims for Medicaid recipients in North Carolina (NC) counties and consider how these differences affect the management of diabetes and public health policy.<h4>Methods</h4>Glucagon, insulin, and sulfonylureas claim counts in each NC county as reported by the NC Medicaid from January 2022 to July 2023 were used. We also used the medical provider density data, county classification data, and pharmacy data, all at the county level, for the state of North Carolina. We compared prescribing patterns across urbanicity categories using descriptive statistics and investigated spatial patterns using data visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 100 NC counties, 38% had zero glucagon claims reported, and all were rural counties. Compared to rural counties, the average number of claims were higher in urban areas, insulin (922.2 vs 120.7), glucagon (123.7 vs 14.6), and sulfonylureas (10.0 vs 2.8). The study revealed significant disparities in diabetes care across North Carolina, with rural counties reporting the lowest glucagon, insulin, and sulfonylureas claims. Urban counties had higher healthcare provider densities and medication claims, with urban areas being 7.6 times more likely to report insulin claims than rural areas, highlighting geographic inequities in care access.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By emphasizing the significance of addressing glucagon prescribing trends, this analysis recommends focused efforts to promote the equitable distribution of life-saving medicines for severe hypoglycemia.",Chiyaka ET; Taylor SR; Drake E; Chaplin M,"Wingate University School of Pharmacy, Wingate, NC.

40502229,Assessing Geographic Diversity in Systematic Reviews: A 3D Interactive Approach Using Cochrane SRs in IPF.,"The Systematic reviews (SRs) for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) play a crucial role in guiding evidence-based healthcare by synthesizing data across multiple studies. A key factor in ensuring the reliability and applicability of these reviews is the geographic diversity of the authors involved, as this can significantly influence the generalizability of findings. Traditional 2D maps used to visualize author locations often fall short in capturing the depth and regional disparities effectively, as overlapping points or dense clusters can obscure critical details, resulting in an incomplete view of geographic distribution. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel approach that combines a 3D geographic map and a Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Network (TS-GAT) to assess and visualize the geographic diversity of authors in SRs on IPF. The 3D visualization provides an enhanced, layered representation of author locations, revealing hidden regional disparities and biases. The TS-GAT captures both temporal and spatial relationships in the author collaboration network, allowing for deeper insights into the evolution of geographic representation over time. This integrated approach aims to uncover potential biases in global representation, offering a comprehensive understanding of the geographic spread and temporal trends in authorship within SRs, ultimately contributing to more balanced and inclusive evidence synthesis.",Li H; Wang J; Liu H,"The McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics, Houston, TX, USA.",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

40517096,Prediction of NIHSS Scores and Acute Ischemic Stroke Severity Using a Cross-attention Vision Transformer Model with Multimodal MRI.,"<h4>Rationale and objectives</h4>This study aimed to develop and evaluate models for classifying the severity of neurological impairment in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients using multimodal MRI data.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective cohort of 1227 AIS patients was collected and categorized into mild (NIHSS<5) and moderate-to-severe (NIHSS≥5) stroke groups based on NIHSS scores. Eight baseline models were constructed for performance comparison, including a clinical model, radiomics models using DWI or multiple MRI sequences, and deep learning (DL) models with varying fusion strategies (early fusion, later fusion, full cross-fusion, and DWI-centered cross-fusion). All DL models were based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) framework. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as AUC and ACC, and robustness was assessed through subgroup analyses and visualization using Grad-CAM.<h4>Results</h4>Among the eight models, the DL model using DWI as the primary sequence with cross-fusion of other MRI sequences (Model 8) achieved the best performance. In the test cohort, Model 8 demonstrated an AUC of 0.914, ACC of 0.830, and high specificity (0.818) and sensitivity (0.853). Subgroup analysis shows that model 8 is robust in most subgroups with no significant prediction difference (p > 0.05), and the AUC value consistently exceeds 0.900. A significant predictive difference was observed in the BMI group (p < 0.001). The results of external validation showed that the AUC values of the model 8 in center 2 and center 3 reached 0.910 and 0.912, respectively. Visualization using Grad-CAM emphasized the infarct core as the most critical region contributing to predictions, with consistent feature attention across DWI, T1WI, T2WI, and FLAIR sequences, further validating the interpretability of the model.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A ViT-based DL model with cross-modal fusion strategies provides a non-invasive and efficient tool for classifying AIS severity. Its robust performance across subgroups and interpretability make it a promising tool for personalized management and decision-making in clinical practice.",Tuxunjiang P; Huang C; Zhou Z; Zhao W; Han B; Tan W; Wang J; Kukun H; Zhao W; Xu R; Aihemaiti A; Subi Y; Zou J; Xie C; Chang Y; Wang Y,"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Department of Radiology, Urumqi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, PR China (P.T., H.H.K., W.Z., R.X., A.A., Y.S., Y.W.).

40494643,Transposon-directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) analysis of &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/i&gt; using nanopore sequencing and a WebAssembly analysis platform.,"Vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> (VREfm) are healthcare-associated opportunistic pathogens of global significance. Genetic tools are needed to understand the molecular basis for VREfm clinically relevant phenotypes, such as persistence within the human gut or antimicrobial resistance. Here, we present a transposon-directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) platform optimized for <i>E. faecium</i>. We engineered a transposon delivery plasmid, pIMTA(<i>tetM</i>), that can generate high-density transposon mutant libraries, combined with Oxford Nanopore Technology amplicon sequencing to map the transposon insertion sites. We have also customized a bioinformatic analysis suite that includes a WebAssembly powered visualization tool called <i>Diana</i>, for TraDIS data exploration and analysis (https://diana.cpg.org.au/). To demonstrate the performance of our platform, we assessed the impact of vancomycin exposure on a library of 48,458 unique transposon mutants. As expected, we could confirm the importance of the <i>vanB</i> operon for VREfm vancomycin resistance. However, we also identified an essential role for both <i>vanWB</i> and <i>vanYB,</i> each previously designated as protein of unknown function and accessory for resistance, respectively. Our end-to-end platform for running TraDIS experiments in VREfm will permit accessible, genome-scale, forward genetic screens to probe molecular mechanisms of persistence and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCEThere are limited genetic tools specifically developed and optimized for function in <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>. Here, we addressed this gap through the development of a transposon-directed insertion-site sequencing platform with a plasmid we engineered to specifically function in <i>E. faecium</i>. The application of nanopore sequencing, with a highly accessible sequence data processing and bioinformatic analysis pipeline, streamlines and simplifies the methodology. These developments will allow the functional genomic analysis of important traits involved in the pathobiology of this understudied bacterium.

40504718,Rethinking Brain Tumor Segmentation from the Frequency Domain Perspective.,"Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection), is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48% (ranging from 2.39% to 7.72%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable computational efficiency and clinical applicability.

40504790,Imported malaria in Cabo Verde (2010-2024): Risks to post-elimination stability.,"Cabo Verde was officially certified malaria-free by the World Health Organization (WHO), following sustained public health interventions and strategic malaria elimination efforts. The country's National Strategic Plan (2020-2024) emphasized strengthening epidemiological and entomological surveillance at the archipelago's entry points (e.g., ports and airports), alongside early diagnosis and case investigation to prevent local transmission. However, imported malaria cases remain a persistent threat and challenge to prevent malaria reintroduction to maintain the elimination status. Therefore, this study aims to analyze imported malaria cases in Cabo Verde from 2010 to 2024, characterizing their locations, origins, epidemiological trends and spatial distribution. The findings aim to support evidence-based decision-making to prevent post-certification disease reintroduction. This study used an ecological time-series approach analyzing all confirmed imported malaria cases reported between 2010 and 2024 in Cabo Verde. Data was collected in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Program and the Integrated Surveillance and Response Service. Incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates were calculated. Joinpoint Regression Analysis was performed to assess time trends, and Holt-Winters additive models were applied for time-series forecasting. Spatial data visualization was also conducted. A total of 383 imported malaria cases were reported. A significant increase trend was observed from 2020 to 2024 (annual percentage change - APC): + 25.75%). Forecast models estimate approximately 80 imported cases annually in 2025 and 2026 (-23.1 to 80). Most cases were reported in Santiago Island (68.9%), particularly in Praia (80.5%). The most common sources of imported infection were Guinea-Bissau (N = 90; 23,5%), Angola (N = 73; 19.1%), Senegal (49; 15.4%, and Nigeria (29; 7.6%). Malaria reintroduction risks persist in Cabo Verde, necessitating continuous surveillance and prevention efforts. Understanding the epidemiological trends and future projections is essential for maintaining Cabo Verde's malaria-free status. Vigilance and strategic interventions, including fast and correct case identification, treatment, and follow-up of imported cases, are some actions that need to be reinforced. Accurate policies, leadership capacity, and necessary resources are key requirements for maintaining and sustaining the elimination.",DePina AJ; Lima GL; Moreira AL; Niang EHA; Garcia KKS,"Programa Eliminação do Paludismo, CCS-SIDA, Ministério da Saúde, Praia, Cabo Verde.",PLOS global public health,2025-06-12,10.1371/journal.pgph.0004592,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40506623,Current status of robot-assisted surgery implementation in endometriosis centers: an international multicentric cross-sectional study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The surgical treatment of endometriosis, which is routinely performed by minimally invasive approach, is developing towards an increasing complexity in deep endometriosis. While RAS appears to be gaining importance, there are few real-life data on its use for patients with endometriosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the current use of RAS in certified endometriosis centers in Central Europe.<h4>Methods</h4>In this international multicentric cross-sectional study, an online branching survey was sent to certified endometriosis centers in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Switzerland. This survey contained 47 questions including proportion of use, indications, advantages and barriers, technical aspects, and training in RAS.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 97 centers contacted, 66% (n = 64) participated. RAS is used for the treatment of endometriosis in 60.8% (n = 31) of the centers with access to a SR, which corresponds to 48.4% of all participating centers. In Austria, 81.8% (n = 9) of centers have SR access, respectively, 88.9% (n = 8) use RAS for endometriosis; in Switzerland, 91.6% (n = 11) and 36.4% (n = 4); and in Germany, 74.4% (n = 29) and 62.1% (n = 18). The reported advantages of RAS include precision (80%, n = 40), instrument mobility (74%, n = 37), and visualization (72%, n = 36). Compared to CLS, RAS is preferred in multidisciplinary cases (84.6%, n = 22), and overweight patients (61.5%, n = 16) and deep endometriosis (61.5%, n = 16). Specific anatomical indications for RAS vs. CLS include FU (57.7%, n = 15), C (53.9%, n = 14), and FB (50%, n = 13) (#Enzian classification). Patient outcomes of RAS compared to CLS are rated as advantageous in 69.2% (n = 18). The main barriers for RAS for centers without an SR include costs (100%, n = 12) and lack of scientific evidence (33.3%, n = 4). 69.2% (n = 18) have dedicated robotic teams, 42.3% (n = 11) have a second console, 69.2% (n = 18) have a simulator, and 34.6% (n = 9) have training programs. A total of 65.4% (n = 17) believes that RAS will replace CLS in selected cases, and 73.1% (n = 19) would prefer RAS if costs were equal.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study demonstrates that RAS is already being used in approximately half of the participating endometriosis centers. While the proportion of RAS procedures compared to CLS is increasing, it still remains comparatively low. Country-specific differences in the use of RAS are evident and are most likely linked to healthcare system structures. Participating centers report both technical and general surgical advantages, as well as specific benefits in cases of deep endometriosis. The main barriers include costs and a lack of scientific evidence. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term role of RAS in the management of endometriosis.",Krentel H; Samartzis N; Kalaitzopoulos DR; Constantin AS; Schweppe KW; Metzler JM; Andrikos D; Witzel I; De Wilde RL; Keckstein J; Burla L,"Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Gynecological Oncology, Bethesda Hospital, Duisburg, Germany.",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,2025-06-12,10.1007/s00404-025-08081-9,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),MIS; Endometriosis; Ras; Ral; Robotic Surgery; minimally invasive surgery; Robotic-assisted Surgery; Robot-assisted Surgery; Deep Endometriosis; Robot-assisted Laparoscopy; Endometriosis Surgery; Migs; Endometriosis Centers

The emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has further complicated treatment, efforts, highlighting the urgent need for targeted policies aimed at prevention and management.<h4>Methods</h4>This study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database, to analyze the global burden of BSDs among individuals aged 0-19 years from 1990 to 2021. Incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were the primary indicators assessed. stratified analysis conducted by gender, age, region, and socio-demographic index (SDI). Temporal trends were evaluated using the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). Date analysis and visualization were performed using the R programming language.<h4>Results</h4>In 2021, the global incidence of BSDs among children and adolescents reached 338 million cases, an increase of 49.32% compared to 1990 (EAPC = 0.86); Prevalence reached 14.23 million cases, an increase of 48.27% (EAPC = 0.85). During the same period, the DALYs rate decreased by 39.01% (EAPC = -1.9). Regionally, the burden was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, while the highest increase in incidence was observed in high-income North America. SDI-based stratification showed that DALYs were highest among infants in low SDI regions, while high SDI regions experienced a marked increase in incidence among adolescents aged 15-19 years. Gender analysis found that the incidence was higher among girls under five years of age, while the overall burden was higher among boys aged 15-19 years compared to girls. Neonates (0-6 days) were identified as the highest-risk group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although a moderate decline in DALYs rate was observed, the incidence and prevalence of BSDs continued to rise globally, with geographic, age-related, and genders disparities. These findings underscore the necessity of developing stratified and targeted intervention strategies to mitigate the increasing burden of BSDs among children and adolescents.",Guo H; Zheng P,"Department of Dermatology, Dermatology Hospital of Fuzhou, Fuzhou, Fujian Province, 350001, China.",BMC pediatrics,2025-06-09,10.1186/s12887-025-05825-z,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Children; Adolescents; Global Burden Of Disease; Bacterial Skin Diseases
40485207,Anomalies of the Brachiocephalic Vein: A Pictorial Review.,"Anomalies of the brachiocephalic or ""innominate"" vein, which may be of course or number, are rare. Previously, most cases were incidentally detected during surgery or in autopsy specimens. Doppler evaluation may also demonstrate these anomalies; however, the sensitivity is poor due to suboptimal visualization of the entire course. With the advent of multidetector CT angiography, these anomalies are increasingly being detected. Although majority of cases are incidentally detected on scans performed for evaluation of congenital heart defects, these anomalies assume clinical importance when central venous cannulation or pacemaker insertion is contemplated through the anomalous side. Prior knowledge of the anomalous anatomy is also important before cardiothoracic surgeries.

40495362,Advances in Pediatric Orthopedic Surgery: 3D Calcium-Density Models for Humerus Deformity.,"BACKGROUND Preoperative planning is crucial for orthopedic interventions, particularly in the correction of severe deformities. Correct implant selection, positioning, and osteotomy planning are essential to achieving optimal surgical outcomes. Recent advancements in 3D printing technology, including the development of calcium-density models, have enhanced visualization and surgical precision. This case study demonstrates the application of this innovative approach in managing a complex proximal humerus deformity in a pediatric patient. CASE REPORT We describe the case of an 8-year-old girl with a severe proximal humerus varus deformity secondary to epiphysiolysis. Her condition was characterized by a cervico-diaphyseal angle of 68° and limited shoulder abduction to 60°. A 3D calcium-density model was employed for meticulous preoperative planning, enabling precise assessment of the deformity, optimization of implant positioning, and accurate osteotomy execution. The surgical procedure consisted of a 15-mm wedge valgus osteotomy using an iliac crest graft and fixation with a PediLoc® plate. This approach achieved a correction of the cervico-diaphyseal angle to 140°, restored shoulder abduction to 180°, and limited the overall surgical time to 2 hours. CONCLUSIONS The use of 3D printing with calcium carbonate-enhanced polylactic acid (PLA) provided superior visualization, radiographic assessment capabilities, and preoperative plate contouring, enhancing surgical efficiency and improving clinical outcomes. The radiopaque properties of the material facilitated intraoperative radiological verification, ensuring precision and safety. This case underscores the potential of this technology to streamline complex pediatric orthopedic surgeries, minimize intraoperative challenges, and improving patient outcomes.

40493285,Development and validation of a nomogram risk prediction model for PICC-related thrombosis in children with hematological malignancies.,"Early identification of high-risk patients is crucial for preventing peripherally intravenous central catheter (PICC)-related thrombosis in children with hematological malignancies. This study aims to develop and validate a clinical risk prediction tool for PICC-related thrombosis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 519 children with hematological malignancies who underwent PICC catheterization at Tongji Hospital between January 2018 and December 2023. Among these children, 98 (18.9%) developed PICC-related thrombosis. A total of 54 potential predictor variables were analyzed, and six independent risk factors were identified: leukemia, number of catheters, history of catheterization, total parenteral nutrition, post-catheterization D-dimer, and post-catheterization fibrinogen. The prediction model constructed based on these factors demonstrated good predictive performance with the area under the curve of 0.844 (95% CI 0.787-0.900) for the training set and 0.794 (95% CI 0.698-0.890) for the validation set. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis further validated the good calibration and utility of the model. Through the visualization of nomogram, the model can provide strong support for the early prediction of PICC-related thrombosis in children with hematological malignancies and holds significant clinical application value.",Fu M; Yang Q; Wu X; Li X; Jiang L; Yan H; Yu G,"Department of Nursing, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",Clinical and experimental medicine,2025-06-10,10.1007/s10238-025-01707-x,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Children; Prediction model; Hematological malignancies; Nomogram; Picc-related Thrombosis
40498438,Expanded Exposure of the Olecranon Osteotomy by Lateral Collateral Ligament Release.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Intra-articular distal humerus fractures with anterior articular involvement necessitate anatomic reduction and stable fixation to restore maximal elbow motion. However, traditional approaches to the elbow provide incomplete exposure of the distal humerus articular surface. To improve visualization of the capitellum and anterior trochlea, we have found it useful to supplement the olecranon osteotomy (OO) with a release, and subsequent repair, of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL). The purpose of this study was to quantify and characterize the additional distal humerus articular surface exposure provided by LUCL release.<h4>Methods</h4>An OO approach was performed in 10 fresh frozen cadaver elbows. The margin of the distal humerus articular surface visible after OO was marked with ink. The LUCL was then released from its humeral origin and the additional region of visible articular surface was marked. The distal humerus was then excised. The region of the articular surface initially visible after OO alone was painted blue, and the additional region visible after LUCL release was painted red. The surface areas of the painted regions were quantified using a three-dimensional scanner.<h4>Results</h4>The mean percent of total distal humerus articular surface, trochlear surface, and capitellar surface visible after OO alone was 50.4 ± 7.9%, 62.8 ± 8.2%, and 20.3 ± 7.8%, respectively. After OO plus LUCL release, 100% of the total articular surface, trochlear surface, and capitellar surface was visible.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The OO is limited in that it only provides exposure of the posterior 63% of the trochlea and posterior 20% of the capitellum. Supplementary LUCL release significantly improves exposure of the OO, reliably providing access to the entire anterior articular surface of the distal humerus.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>The expanded exposure of the OO by LUCL release may be useful for optimizing visualization and fixation of complex, intra-articular distal humerus fractures involving the anterior articular surface.",Ferlauto HR; Schroen CA; Nietsch KS; Beitler BG; Shukla D; Kim JM; Hausman MR,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.",The Journal of hand surgery,2025-06-11,10.1016/j.jhsa.2025.04.023,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Fracture; Distal Humerus; Olecranon Osteotomy; Articular Surface; Lateral Ulnar Collateral Ligament
40490644,Carcinoma in situ of the pancreas detected by progressive focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy without main pancreatic ductal change.,"We report a case in which the progression of focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy suggested the presence of high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia/carcinoma in situ. A 77-year-old man was found to have a pancreatic cyst during a health checkup using transabdominal ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed multiple cysts, each measuring ≤ 5 mm, in the pancreatic head and body. Over nine years of intermittent follow-up, imaging showed progressive focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy extending from the pancreatic head to the body, without changes in the cysts or stenosis or dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. Three-dimensional computed tomography facilitated visualization of the atrophic progression. Transabdominal and endoscopic ultrasound identified a thin pancreatic parenchyma with a surrounding hyperechoic area but no hypoechoic masses. Serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytological examination suggested adenocarcinoma. Surgery was performed, and histopathological examination revealed a 15-mm atrophic region with high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma in situ confined to the main pancreatic duct. The lesion extended 5 mm downstream and 10 mm upstream. Even in cases of focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy without stenosis or dilation of the main pancreatic duct, its progression may indicate high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia/carcinoma in situ and warrant serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytology.",Nishiyama S; Hisa T; Sakata S; Ito Y; Kudo A; Yamada T; Osera S; Fukushima H; Hamura R; Shiozawa S,"Department of Gastroenterology, Saku Central Hospital Advanced Care Center, Nagano, Japan.",Clinical journal of gastroenterology,2025-06-09,10.1007/s12328-025-02158-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Early-stage Pancreatic Cancer; Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (Pdac); Three-dimensional Computed Tomography (3D-ct); High-grade Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (Panin); Serial Pancreatic Juice Aspiration Cytological Examination
40514598,Quantitative and qualitative assessment of ultra-low-dose paranasal sinus CT using deep learning image reconstruction: a comparison with hybrid iterative reconstruction.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative performances of ultra-low-dose computed tomography (CT) with deep learning image reconstruction (DLR) compared with those of hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR) for preoperative paranasal sinus (PNS) imaging.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective analysis included 132 patients who underwent non-contrast ultra-low-dose sinus CT (0.03 mSv). Images were reconstructed using hybrid IR and DLR. Objective image quality metrics, including image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), noise power spectrum (NPS), and no-reference perceptual image sharpness, were assessed. Two board-certified radiologists independently performed subjective image quality evaluations.<h4>Results</h4>The ultra-low-dose CT protocol achieved a low radiation dose (effective dose: 0.03 mSv). DLR showed significantly lower image noise (28.62 ± 4.83 Hounsfield units) compared to hybrid IR (140.70 ± 16.04, p < 0.001), with DLR yielding smoother and more uniform images. DLR demonstrated significantly improved SNR (22.47 ± 5.82 vs 9.14 ± 2.45, p < 0.001) and CNR (71.88 ± 14.03 vs 11.81 ± 1.50, p < 0.001). NPS analysis revealed that DLR reduced the noise magnitude and NPS peak values. Additionally, DLR demonstrated significantly sharper images (no-reference perceptual sharpness metric: 0.56 ± 0.04) compared to hybrid IR (0.36 ± 0.01). Radiologists rated DLR as superior in overall image quality, bone structure visualization, and diagnostic confidence compared to hybrid IR at ultra-low-dose CT.<h4>Conclusion</h4>DLR significantly outperformed hybrid IR in ultra-low-dose PNS CT by reducing image noise, improving SNR and CNR, enhancing image sharpness, and maintaining critical anatomical visualization, demonstrating its potential for effective preoperative planning with minimal radiation exposure.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Ultra-low-dose CT for paranasal sinuses is essential for patients requiring repeated scans and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) planning to reduce cumulative radiation exposure. Findings DLR outperformed hybrid IR in ultra-low-dose paranasal sinus CT. Clinical relevance Ultra-low-dose CT with DLR delivers sufficient image quality for detailed surgical planning, effectively minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure to enhance patient safety.",Otgonbaatar C; Lee D; Choi J; Jang H; Shim H; Ryoo I; Jung HN; Suh S,"Medical Imaging AI Research Center, Canon Medical Systems Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.",European radiology,2025-06-13,10.1007/s00330-025-11763-2,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Image reconstruction; Paranasal sinuses; computed tomography; Image Quality
40512429,3D printed vitamin D impregnated catheters for magnetic resonance-guided interventions: proof of concept and imaging characteristics.,"<h4>Background</h4>Catheters used for magnetic resonance (MR)-guided interventions require intra-catheter coils and often produce artifacts. This study aimed to fabricate 3D-printed catheters impregnated with vitamin D solution to allow for optimal visualization during MR-guided procedures.<h4>Methods</h4>3D printing was used to fabricate catheters impregnated with vitamin D solution. Computer-aided design files were generated for a size 18 French catheter prototype with a compartment for vitamin D solution to be manually introduced into the catheter's lumen and sealed via thermoplastic welding. Polylactic acid (PLA) bioplastic was 3D printed into filaments via material extrusion (FDM<sup>®</sup>, Stratasys, Eden Prairie, MN) on a 5th generation Replicator 3D printer (MakerBot). Three different forms of vitamin D were used, cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, and calcitriol, and 0.9% normal saline served as a control. Three prints of each catheter type were fabricated and scanned using a 1.5 T MR whole body scanner (Avanto, Siemens Healthcare) inside a small flex loop surface radiofrequency (RF) coil. A 3D gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequence was used with the following acquisition parameters: 4.52/11 ms TE/TR, 15° flip angle, 256 × 256 matrix with 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm in-plane resolution, 24 coronal slabs, 2 mm thickness, and 140 Hz receiver bandwidth. Three averages were used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The GRE sequence was run with 4 different flip angles: 3°, 15°, 30°, and 45° to perform T1 mapping.<h4>Results</h4>All 3D-printed catheters impregnated with vitamin D produced a signal on MR. SNR for vitamin D catheters was similar across the various forms of vitamin D: mean SNRs for 100% cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, and calcitriol were 138, 139, and 130. Mean SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for vitamin D catheters were significantly higher than the control saline catheter (p < 0.001, for both SNR and CNR). T1 values were lower in vitamin D-impregnated catheters compared to the saline control (228 ± 67 ms and 3371 ± 493 ms, respectively; p < 0.0001), indicating a better signal.<h4>Conclusions</h4>3D printing of catheters impregnated with vitamin D is feasible and can potentially optimize MR-guided procedures.",Cunningham LO; Ganapathy A; Eldeniz C; Weisman JA; Lindsay KE; Jammalamadaka U; Tappa K; Salter A; An H; Woodard PK; Ballard DH,"School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.",3D printing in medicine,2025-06-13,10.1186/s41205-025-00273-y,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Catheter Tracking; 3D Printing; Mr-guided Interventions; Custom Medical Devices; Mr-compatible Materials
40493398,Evaluation and comparison of occlusal interference markings with articulating papers of varying thicknesses: An in vivo study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different thicknesses of articulating paper (100, 40, and 12 µm) in detecting occlusal interferences. The goal was to identify an optimal thickness range that could reliably mark clinically significant occlusal contacts, ensuring better outcomes in restorative procedures.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>An in vivo study was conducted with 13 patients requiring a single-tooth porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crown restoration. Occlusal contacts were assessed using three thicknesses of articulating papers (100, 40, and 12 µm) during maximum intercuspation. Each thickness was applied sequentially, and any occlusal interference, identified by a ""bull's eye"" marking, was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test to assess differences in detection efficacy among the papers.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 82 attempts to locate occlusal interferences, the 100 µm and 40 µm papers effectively marked contacts, with the 100 µm paper registering interferences in 58 attempts and the 40 µm paper in 60 attempts. The 12 µm paper, however, failed to mark interferences in 71 attempts. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between 100 and 40 µm papers in detecting interferences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Both 100 and 40 µm articulating papers effectively detected occlusal interferences, with 100 µm providing larger, more visible marks and 40 µm offering greater precision in localized contact detection. In contrast, 12 µm paper showed limited efficacy under standard occlusal forces, underscoring the need for thicker papers in clinical settings for ease of visualization.

40512248,Genome-wide Screening of the Escherichia coli Keio Knockout Collection Identifies Genetic Determinants of Epetraborole Hypersusceptibility.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The escalating threat of antibiotic resistance necessitates innovative strategies to enhance the efficacy of emerging antimicrobials. Epetraborole (EP) is a boron-containing antibiotic targeting leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) and has attracted interest for its novel mechanism of action and potential to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens.<h4>Methods</h4>To elucidate the genetic determinants of EP susceptibility, we conducted a genome-wide screen (GWS) of the Escherichia coli Keio knockout collection, which comprises ~4,000 single-gene deletion mutants. Mutants exhibiting increased susceptibility to epetraborole were identified and validated via complementation assays.<h4>Results</h4>Disrupted genes included those involved in leucine biosynthesis (leuD), RNA turnover (rnb), tRNA modification (trmU), ubiquinone biosynthesis (ubiG), NAD salvage pathway (pncA), arginine transport (artJ), transcriptional regulator (yddM) and ribosome biogenesis (yhbY), suggesting that epetraborole's primary inhibition of LeuRS synergizes with defects in these pathways. Bioinformatic analyses (Omics Dashboard, DAVID, STRING) linked these genes to tRNA homeostasis, stress response networks, and central dogma processes, implicating tRNA dysregulation as a critical vulnerability under epetraborole-induced stress.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identifies novel genetic contributors to epetraborole susceptibility and provides a framework for exploring adjuvant therapies or resistance mechanisms to enhance its clinical utility against MDR infections.",Babayeva A; Çöl B,"Graduate School of Natural and Applied Sciences, Department of Biology, Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University, Muğla, Turkey.",European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2025-06-13,10.1007/s10096-025-05183-9,1.5,dashboard(abstract),Gene; Antibiotic Resistance; Escherichia Coli; Keio Collection; Epetraborole
