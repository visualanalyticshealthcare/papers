40269860,ABiMed: An intelligent and visual clinical decision support system for medication reviews and polypharmacy management.,"<h4>Background</h4>Polypharmacy can be both a public health and an economic issue. Medication reviews are structured interviews of the patient by the pharmacist, aiming at optimizing the drug treatment and deprescribing potentially inappropriate medications. However, they remain difficult to perform and time-consuming. Several clinical decision support systems were developed for helping clinicians to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy. However, most were limited to the implementation of clinical practice guidelines. In this work, our objective is to design an innovative clinical decision support system for medication reviews and polypharmacy management, named ABiMed.<h4>Methods</h4>ABiMed associates several approaches: guidelines implementation, but also the automatic extraction of patient data from the GP's electronic health record and its transfer to the pharmacist, and the visual presentation of contextualized drug knowledge using visual analytics. We performed an ergonomic assessment and qualitative evaluations involving pharmacists and GPs during focus groups and workshops.<h4>Results</h4>We describe the proposed architecture, which allows a collaborative multi-user usage. We present the various screens of ABiMed for entering or verifying patient data, for accessing drug knowledge (posology, adverse effects, interactions), for viewing STOPP/START rules and for suggesting modification to the treatment. Qualitative evaluations showed that health professionals were highly interested in our approach, associating the automatic guidelines execution with the visual presentation of drug knowledge.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The association of guidelines implementation with visual presentation of knowledge is a promising approach for managing polypharmacy. Future works will focus on the improvement and the evaluation of ABiMed.",Abdelmalek M; Romain L; Nada B; Thibaud L; Yoann LB; Christian S; Brigitte S; Julien G; Romain L; Catherine L; Stéfan D; Matthieu S; Joël B; Karima S; Sophie D; Hector F; Rosy T; Jean-Baptiste L,"INSERM, Sorbonne Université, Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Laboratory of Medical Informatics and Knowledge Engineering in e-Health, LIMICS, 15 rue de l'école de médecine, Paris, 75006, France.",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2025-04-23,10.1186/s12911-025-03002-x,17.2,"visual analytics(kw,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); clinical decision support(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract); electronic health record(abstract)",Clinical Decision Support Systems; Visual Analytics; Medication Review; Polypharmacy Management; Stopp/start V3
40260042,Nursing Students' Perspectives on Integrating Artificial Intelligence Into Clinical Practice and Training: A Qualitative Descriptive Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare has introduced transformative tools to enhance clinical decision-making and streamline workflows. In nursing, a profession characterized by human-centric care, AI adoption offers both significant opportunities and notable challenges. However, the perspectives of nursing students, future professionals, on integrating AI into clinical practice and education remain underexplored.<h4>Aim</h4>This study aimed to explore nursing students' perceptions of incorporating AI into their clinical training and professional practice, with a focus on identifying benefits, challenges, and potential areas for improvement.<h4>Methods</h4>A qualitative descriptive design explored the experiences and attitudes of 25 nursing students from five colleges in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Participants were purposively sampled to ensure diverse educational and clinical backgrounds. Semi-structured interviews in Bangla, lasting 40-50 min, were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Data were collected from May 8, 2024 to August 10, 2024. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and themes. Credibility was ensured through member checking, dependability via an audit trail, and confirmability through peer debriefing. Data visualization tools were used to map thematic relationships effectively.<h4>Results</h4>Thematic analysis revealed four major themes: (1) AI integration in nursing education, (2) ethical and professional concerns, (3) preparedness for AI-driven practice, and (4) AI's impact on nursing practice. Participants expressed both optimism about AI's potential to improve accuracy and efficiency and apprehension about their readiness to use AI effectively in practice.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings underscore the need for comprehensive curriculum reforms that incorporate AI training, address ethical concerns, and emphasize the role of AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for human expertise. These insights provide a roadmap for integrating AI into nursing education while preserving the compassionate core of nursing practice.",Rony MKK; Ahmad S; Das DC; Tanha SM; Deb TR; Akter MR; Khatun MA; Khalil MI; Peu UR; Parvin MR; Alrazeeni DM; Akter F,Miyan Research Institute International University of Business Agriculture and Technology Dhaka Bangladesh.,Health science reports,2025-04-21,10.1002/hsr2.70728,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Clinical practice; Nursing Education; Ethical Considerations; Healthcare Technology; Student Perspectives
40264174,From glitter to gold: recommendations for effective dashboards from design through sustainment.,"<h4>Background</h4>Dashboards-tools that compile and summarize key performance data-have become increasingly utilized for supporting data organization and decision-making processes across various fields, such as business, economics, healthcare, and policy. The dashboard's impact is dependent on its use by the individuals for whom it was designed. Yet, few studies measure dashboard use, and of those that do, their utility is limited. When dashboards go unused, they provide little value and impact. We argue that successful and long-term use of dashboards can be achieved using human-centered design and implementation science methods.<h4>Main body</h4>In this article, we describe the characteristics of dashboards and provide examples of existing dashboards. We discuss the common pitfalls of dashboards that result in their limited use. Next, we proffer how human-centered design and implementation science can improve dashboard relevance. We provide eight recommendations from across the design to the sustainment phase. To guide dashboard developers and implementers, we organize our recommendations using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) Framework. Lastly, we raise several cautions when using human-centered design and implementation science methods in dashboard development and implementation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There is a need for more effective, sustainable, and impactful dashboards. We suggest that incorporating human-centered design and implementation science methods can facilitate achieving this goal.",Rossi FS; Adams MCB; Aarons G; McGovern MP,"Stanford Center for Dissemination and Implementation (CDI), Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA. fsrossi@stanford.edu.",Implementation science : IS,2025-04-22,10.1186/s13012-025-01430-x,7.4,"dashboard(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Implementation Science; Dashboards; Human-centered Design; Epis; Dashboard Use
40259251,The use of graphical lung sound visualizations in medical education: an evaluation of its impact on clinical clerkship.,"<h4>Background</h4>Auscultation is a simple physical examination that provides important clinical information. Many educational materials are available to facilitate students' understanding of lung auscultation. Some studies and teaching materials have visualized lung sounds as spectrograms. However, their effectiveness as educational tools remains unclear. Accordingly, this study evaluates the effect of auscultation education using lung sound visualization on medical students' diagnostic skills.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants were medical students completing their four-week clinical clerkship (CC) in the Department of Respiratory Medicine of Chiba University Hospital. Sixty-three students participated in this study between November 2022 and July 2023. They were divided into two groups: the full-term visualization group (n = 31) and the half-term visualization group (n = 32). Although both groups were taught lung sound visualization using simple diagrams, there was a two-week difference in the length of exposure. We taught visualization to the full-term visualization group on the first day of the CC, and to the half-term visualization group after the midpoint test. Thus, the full-term visualization group practiced lung auscultations with visualization for four weeks, while the half-term visualization group had two weeks of practice. All the students performed lung auscultation tests with a simulator three times: pre-test at the beginning, midpoint at the end of the second week, and post-test at the end of CC. In addition, they responded to questionnaires regarding lung auscultation at the beginning and end of CC.<h4>Results</h4>The score gain from baseline in the lung auscultation tests at the midpoint was 0.5; p = 0.018). The increase in scores at the post-test was not significantly different between the two groups (median full-term, + 3.6; half-term, + 2.3; p = 0.060). The self-reported confidence, clinical reasoning ability, activity, and frequency of lung auscultation improved in both groups. The questionnaire responses indicated that the students accepted the value of lung sound visualization.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Differing the duration of exposure to lung sound visualization (two weeks and four weeks) showed no significant difference in medical students' auscultation skills.",Kawame C; Kasai H; Shiko Y; Kuriyama A; Takeda K; Tajima H; Hayama N; Saito M; Ito S; Suzuki T,"Department of Respirology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan. cmjacky821@gmail.com.",BMC medical education,2025-04-21,10.1186/s12909-025-07170-2,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Medical education; Auscultation; Medical Students; Clinical Clerkship; Lung Sounds
40269426,Using an AI-Powered Solution to Transform Nursing Workflow and Improve Inpatient Care: A Retrospective Observational Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Nurses face an escalating workload, including tasks not directly related to patient care, such as responding to patients' requests for water or extra blankets, and adjusting room conditions like air conditioning, which can contribute to burnout and pose potential risks for both professionals and patients.<h4>Purpose</h4>We aimed to evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technology that automates patient requests and directs them to the appropriate teams in other departments instead of to the nurses' station, thereby eliminating the need for nursing intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective observational study, conducted in the surgical clinic of a large hospital over 30 days, examined data gathered from patients occupying 16 beds (as our focus was on the volume and type of patient requests generated per bed rather than per patient, patient turnover did not affect the study). During this period, the AI-driven platform, known as Neonpass Room, was implemented in addition to the traditional bell-activation request system.<h4>Results</h4>During the 30-day implementation of Neonpass Room, 2,113 requests were recorded, mostly from patients, and the AI-powered system directed 35.4% of those requests, which required clinical attention, to the nursing staff. The remaining requests were routed to other appropriate teams, such as housekeeping or maintenance, according to the nature of the requests. Among the top 10 most frequent request types, only two were explicitly directed to the nursing team: ""check IV fluids"" and ""support with restroom use."" The AI platform also measured the response times among the various departments (the nursing team had the shortest response time and the cleaning staff the longest) and enabled the visualization of patterns in patient-initiated requests by request type over a 24-hour period. The AI solution effectively reduced the nursing team's workload by nearly three out of five patient requests, resulting in considerable time savings for nurses.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neonpass Room allowed the nursing staff to improve their focus on patient care by optimizing task delegation. Once integrated into the hospital's operations, an AI-driven platform like Neonpass Room would provide managers with valuable strategic insights into the allocation of hospital services.",Gentil LLS; Pires VAL; Andrade-Silva J; Almeida YE; Pinheiro PG; Pinheiro CG; Laselva CR,"Luana Llagostera Sillano Gentil is the hospital director of the Municipal Hospital Moyses Deutsch in São Paulo, Brazil.

40280174,Interpretable Machine Learning for Predicting Anterior Uveitis in Axial Spondyloarthritis. ,"Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, with anterior uveitis (AU) as a common extra-articular manifestation. Predicting AU onset in axSpA patients is challenging, as traditional statistical methods often fail to capture the disease's complexity. This study aimed to develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model to predict AU onset in axSpA patients through a historical cohort analysis of 1508 patients from a tertiary medical center. Clinical data involving 54 variables were preprocessed through imputation, factorization, oversampling, outlier capping, and standardization. Recursive feature elimination identified 12 key predictors. Subsequently, 10 ML algorithms were assessed using performance metrics and visualization techniques. The gradient boosting machine model incorporating 12 key factors showed high accuracy in predicting AU risk. Shapley additive explanations analysis revealed that hip involvement, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and smoking were the most influential predictors. The model's interpretability provided clear insights into the contribution of each feature to AU risk, supporting early diagnosis and personalized treatment. The gradient boosting machine model predicts AU risk in axSpA patients, helping identify high-risk cases for early intervention and personalized treatment to prevent complications such as vision loss.",Li H; Guo Q; Zhang T; Zhou S; Guo C,"From the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The People's Hospital of Baoan Shenzhen, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,2025-04-25,10.1097/rhu.0000000000002225,5.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(title,abstract); data(abstract)",
40280548,Special Issue on CDS Failures: Redesigning Clinical Decision Support for Retinopathy of Prematurity Screening After Alert Failure. ,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness. Guidelines recommend screening for infants with gestational age at birth < 31 weeks or birthweight ≤ 1500g. However, ensuring timely screening during readmissions after birth is challenging. To analyze the performance of an interruptive alert at a large academic pediatric hospital for identifying premature infants needing ROP screening upon hospital readmission and to describe how data informed the transition to a non-interruptive dashboard. The alert appeared for patients 1-365 days of age hospitalized in acute care or pediatric intensive care and instructed providers to order an ophthalmology consult from within the alert and to call ophthalmology for at-risk patients. For quality improvement, the clinical decision support (CDS) advisory group evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of the alert. We exacted alert metrics from the hospital's enterprise data warehouse, including the user response and feedback, patient characteristics (age, birth gestational age, and birth weight), and any ophthalmology consultations. We analyzed the percentage of encounters seen by ophthalmology using a statistical process control chart during alert implementation and 6 months before and after. The alert appeared 3309 times during 2194 patient encounters usually. Users chose ""Accept and place order"" for 43% (943/2194) of encounters, but only 11% (102/943) had an ophthalmology consult; 34% (53/155) of ophthalmology consultations occurred in encounters with a final response other than ""Accept and place order"". The intervention was redesigned using a non-interruptive surveillance dashboard with greater specificity, and the alert was deimplemented. Analysis of a failed interruptive alert for identifying patients at risk for ROP led to a transition to targeted surveillance using a dashboard. This case emphasizes the importance of aligning the CDS modality to the clinical workflow, information availability, and user decision-making needs and should be supported by governance.",Guzman Karlsson MCG; Hess LM; Jeppesen AL; Fortunov RM,"Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, United States.",Applied clinical informatics,2025-04-25,10.1055/a-2594-3571,4.6,"dashboard(abstract); clinical decision support(title,abstract); data(abstract)",
40258295,Tailoring Rheumatoid Arthritis Visit Timing Based on mHealth App Data: Mixed Methods Assessment of Implementation and Usability.,"<h4>Background</h4>Visits to medical subspecialists are common, with follow-up timing often based on heuristics rather than evidence. Unnecessary visits contribute to long wait times for new patients. Specialists could enhance visit timing and reduce frequency by systematically monitoring patients' symptoms between visits, especially for symptom-driven conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We previously designed an intervention using a mobile health (mHealth) app to collect patient-reported outcomes (PRO). One of several aims of the app was to assist rheumatologists in determining visit timing for patients with RA. The intervention did not reduce visit frequency.<h4>Objective</h4>To explore possible reasons for the lack of association between the intervention and visit frequency, we describe app usage, assess usability, and identify barriers and facilitators for using between-visit PRO data to reduce visits when patients' symptoms are stable.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed patients' use of the app by reporting adherence (percent of PRO questionnaires completed during the 12-month study) and retention (use in the last month of the study). To examine rheumatologists' experiences, we summarized views of the electronic health record (EHR)-embedded PRO dashboard and EHR inbox messages suggesting early or deferred visits. We assessed app usability using the interactive mHealth App Usability Questionnaire for Ease of Use and Usefulness for patients and the System Usability Scale for rheumatologists. We assessed rheumatologist-level effects of intervention usage using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum and equality of proportion tests. We identified barriers and facilitators through interviews and surveys.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis included 150 patients with RA and their 11 rheumatologists. Patients answered a median of 53.3% (IQR 34.1%-69.2%) of PRO questionnaires; this proportion varied by rheumatologist (range 40.7%-67%). Over half of the patients used the app during the final month of the study (56%, range 51%-65%, by rheumatologists); the median number of months of use was 12 (IQR 9-12). Rheumatologists viewed the dashboard 78 times (17.6% of 443 visits) with significant differences in viewing rates by rheumatologist (range 10%-66%; P<.01). There were 108 generated messages sent to rheumatologists suggesting a deferred visit (24.4% of 443 visits) with significant differences in message counts received per visit by rheumatologist (range 10.8%-22.6%; P=.03). Rheumatologists' reported barriers to offering visit deferrals included already scheduling as far out as they were comfortable and rescheduling complexities for staff. Based on 39 patient interviews and 44 surveys, patients reported 2 main barriers to app usage: questionnaire frequency not being tailored to them and reduced motivation after not discussing PRO data with their rheumatologist. A total of 5 interviewed patients received the option to defer their visits, of which 3 elected to defer the appointment and 2 chose to keep it.<h4>Conclusions</h4>While an mHealth app for reporting RA PROs was used frequently by patients, using these data to reduce the frequency of unneeded visits was not straightforward. Better engagement of clinicians may improve the use of PRO data.",Rudin RS; Santacroce LM; Ganguli I; Solomon DH,"RAND, 20 Park Plaza, Boston, MA, 02116, United States, 1 6173382059.",JMIR formative research,2025-04-21,10.2196/60854,4.3,"dashboard(abstract); data(title,abstract); electronic health record(abstract)",Rheumatoid arthritis; Rheumatology; Patient-reported Outcomes; Mobile Health; Visit Frequency; Visit Timing

40268236,CIWARS: a web server for antibiotic resistance surveillance using longitudinal metagenomic data.,"The rise of antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a substantial threat to human and animal health, food security, and economic stability. Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) has emerged as a powerful strategy for population-level AR monitoring, providing valuable data to guide public health and policy decisions. Metagenomic sequencing is especially promising, as it can yield comprehensive profiles of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and other genes relevant to AR in a single run. However, online analytical platforms to facilitate analysis of longitudinal metagenomic data are lacking. To address this, we introduce CyberInfrastructure for Waterborne Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (CIWARS), a web server configured for characterizing key AR trends from longitudinal metagenomic WBS data. CIWARS offers comprehensive profiling of ARGs and taxonomic profiling of pathogen-associated bacterial taxonomic groups, identifies potential associations of ARGs with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and pathogen-containing taxa, and assesses resistome risk based on the co-occurrence of ARGs, MGEs, and pathogen-like sequences. Additionally, it detects anomalous AR indicators over time, aiding in identifying potential events of concern, such as the emergence of resistant strains or outbreaks. Through interactive temporal data visualization, CIWARS enables AR monitoring and can serve as a tool to inform effective and timely interventions to mitigate the spread and transmission of AR. Here, CIWARS is demonstrated using longitudinal metagenomic data from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and effluent, but it can be extended to any environment. CIWARS provides a valuable tool to support global efforts to combat the evolution and spread of AR, while also guiding agricultural and public health efforts aimed at optimizing antibiotic use.

40287750,An MRI-based fusion model for preoperative prediction of perineural invasion status in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. ,"To develop and validate an MRI-based fusion model for preoperative prediction of perineural invasion (PNI) status in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). A retrospective collection of 192 ICC patients from three medical centers (training set: n = 147; external test set: n = 45) was performed. Patients were classified into the PNI-positive and PNI-negative groups based on postoperative pathological results. After image preprocessing, a total of 1,197 features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). Feature selection was performed, and a radiomics model was constructed using machine learning algorithms, followed by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) visualization. Subsequently, a deep learning model was constructed based on the pre-trained ResNet101, with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) used for visualization. Finally, a fusion model incorporating deep learning, radiomics, and clinical features was developed using logistic regression, and visualization was performed with a nomogram. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated based on the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The fusion model, which integrates deep learning signature, radiomics signature, and two clinical features, demonstrated strong discrimination for PNI status. In the training set, the AUC was 0.905, with an accuracy of 0.823; in the external test set, the AUC was 0.760, with an accuracy of 0.778. Visualization methods provided support for the practical application of the model.

This study evaluates the potential of the Da Vinci single-port (SP) system, which represents a significant advancement in minimally invasive surgery. A narrative review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus databases to identify relevant studies published between January 2018 and February 2025. Search terms included 'single-port robotic prostatectomy,' 'Da Vinci SP system,' and 'robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.' Studies comparing SP and multi-port (MP) systems were prioritized. The SP system is discussed in terms of its technical innovations, including 360° operative field visualization, integrated optics and instruments, and enhanced depth perception. Clinical benefits, such as reduced blood loss, faster recovery, improved cosmetic outcomes, and reduced surgical trauma, are highlighted. Comparisons are drawn between the SP and multi-port systems, focusing on oncological and functional outcomes, as well as the challenges associated with the SP system's steeper learning curve. The SP system holds great promise in advancing patient care in RARP, particularly through its minimally invasive approach. While achieving comparable outcomes to MP systems, it uniquely reduces surgical trauma. However, successful implementation requires overcoming technical challenges and adapting to the learning curve. Future research should focus on refining the technology and exploring its long-term impact on clinical outcomes.",Pisotskyi O; Petrasz P; Zorga P; Gałęski M; Szponar P; Koper K; Brzeżniakiewicz-Janus K; Drewa T; Kaczmarek K; Czarnogórski MC; Adamowicz J,"Urology and Urological Oncology Department, Multidisciplinary Regional Hospital, Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland.",Expert review of medical devices,2025-04-26,10.1080/17434440.2025.2499661,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40287704,SCNN1A expression in triple-negative breast cancer: clinical implications for prognosis and neoadjuvant therapy response. ,"This study aimed to identify differential genes between pathological complete response (pCR) and non-pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Additionally, the expression and clinical significance of the differential gene SCNN1A in TNBC were explored. Differential genes related to prognosis following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC were identified using the GEO database. Core genes were selected through the Cytoscape visualization and support vector machine (SVM) feature selection. The prognostic significance of these genes was assessed via online databases. SCNN1A expression and its correlation with clinicopathological data and neoadjuvant chemotherapy response were analyzed in 283 TNBC patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University using immunohistochemistry. Eleven core genes, including SCNN1A, were identified from 912 differential genes. High SCNN1A expression was associated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients via online database analysis. Gene set difference analysis (GSVA) and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that SCNN1A was involved in several metabolic pathways.

40259700,Coblation-Assisted Transoral Endoscopic Excision of Lingual Thyroglossal Duct Cysts.,"ImportanceLingual thyroglossal duct cysts (LTGDCs) are rare congenital anomalies that necessitate proactive surgical intervention due to their potential for life-threatening airway obstruction. The challenging anatomical location of LTGDCs complicates their surgical management, and there are currently no standardized surgical modalities in place.ObjectiveTo analyze the clinical features of LTGDCs and evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of coblation-assisted transoral endoscopic excision of LTGDCs.DesignRetrospective case series (2009-2022) analyzing preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data.SettingTertiary academic center.ParticipantsTwenty-nine patients (20 males, 9 females; ages 3-70, with a median age of 34 years) were diagnosed with LTGDCs, including 7 (24.1%) with recurrent LTGDCs following prior surgeries at other institutions.InterventionCoblation-assisted transoral endoscopic excision of LTGDC using FK retractors and a 30° Hopkins telescope for optimal visualization and manipulation.Main Outcome MeasuresComplete cyst excision, postoperative recovery, recurrence rates, complications, and surgical feasibility.ResultsAll LTGDCs were completely excised. During the procedure, it was found that the LTGDCs abutted but did not adhere to the hyoid bone, which allowed for their dissection from the periosteum of the hyoid bone using coblation. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with an average postoperative stay of 3.1 days (range 1-5 days). No complications, such as bleeding, infection, or airway obstruction, occurred. The mean follow-up period was 5.3 years (range 6 months to 12.4 years), with no recurrences observed during this time.ConclusionsCoblation-assisted transoral endoscopic excision is a reliable, effective, and minimally invasive approach for managing LTGDCs. It ensures complete removal with low recurrence and complication rates, aided by superior visualization and manipulation space provided by FK retractors and a 30° Hopkins telescope.RelevanceThis technique offers a safe alternative to traditional surgeries, reducing trauma and enhancing recovery.

40287764,Evolution of the reduction technique for unstable pelvic ring fractures: a narrative review. ,"Unstable pelvic ring fractures are associated with high mortality and morbidity, and the quality of reduction is critical to the prognosis. While previous reviews have examined general fracture reduction techniques, there is limited focus on the specific advancements and challenges in the reduction technique of unstable pelvic ring fractures. The pelvic fracture reduction technique has undergone a four-stage evolution: open reduction, conventional closed reduction, navigation-assisted closed reduction, and robot-assisted automatic closed reduction. This review discusses and compares the features, effectiveness, and safety of each reduction technique. Open reduction improves clinical outcomes compared to nonsurgical management; however, it is no longer commonly practiced due to its association with extensive soft tissue damage. Although conventional closed reduction is minimally invasive and reduces intraoperative blood loss, surgical duration, and the length of hospital stay, frequent fluoroscopy is required to assess the reduction position, imposing a high risk of radiation exposure. Computer-aided navigation technology has advanced closed reduction techniques by allowing better visualization of the fracture site and surgical instruments, thereby enhancing the quality of pelvic fracture reduction and reducing radiation exposure. The recently developed robot-assisted automatic reduction technique relieves the burden on orthopedic surgeons and further reduces intraoperative radiation exposure. Future advancements in the pelvic reduction technique may involve big data-based intelligent reduction to enable broader indications such as bilateral pelvic fractures.",Shen L; Xue X; Ping Y; Song Z; Zhong C; Su G; Zhao C,"Department of Clinical Research and Medical Science, Medtronic China, 19th Floor, Building B, The New Bund World Trade Center Phase I, No. 5 Lane 255 Dongyu Road, Pudong New District, Shanghai, 200126, China.",European journal of medical research,2025-04-26,10.1186/s40001-025-02570-y,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40257813,Computational Modeling of Nasal Cavity Aerodynamics: Implications for Surgical Outcomes and Targeted Drug Administration.,"The primary goal of sinonasal surgery is to improve a patient's quality of life, which is generally achieved by enhancing drug delivery (eg, saline rinses, nasal steroids) and nasal airflow. Both drug delivery and nasal airflow are dependent on the anatomic structure of the sinonasal cavity and the relationship between this anatomy and airflow and drug delivery can be studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD generally uses computed tomography scans and computational algorithms to predict airflow or drug delivery and can help us understand surgical outcomes and optimize drug delivery for patients. This study employs CFD to simulate nasal airflow dynamics and optimize drug delivery in the nasal cavity to highlight the utility of CFD for studying sinonasal disease. Utilizing COMSOL Multiphysics software, we developed detailed models to analyze changes in airflow characteristics before and after functional endoscopic sinus surgery, focusing on pressure distribution, velocity profiles, streamline patterns, and heat transfer. This research examines the impact of varying levels of nasal airway obstruction on airflow and heat transfer. In addition, we explore the characteristics of nasal drug delivery by simulating diverse spray parameters, including particle size, spray angle, and velocity. Our comprehensive approach allows for the visualization of drug particle trajectories and deposition patterns, providing crucial insights for enhancing surgical outcomes and improving targeted drug administration. By integrating patient-specific nasal cavity models and considering factors such as airway outlet pressure, this study offers valuable data on pressure cross-sections, flow rate variations, and particle behavior within the nasal passages. The findings of this research can be useful for both surgical planning and the development of more effective nasal drug delivery methods, potentially leading to enhanced clinical outcomes in respiratory treatment.",Liu G; Martin WJ; Mirmozaffari Y; Ni R; Li Z,"Mechatronics Engineering, Morgan State University, Baltimore, MD, USA.","Ear, nose, & throat journal",2025-04-21,10.1177/01455613251335109,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Numerical simulation; Drug Delivery; Nasal Cavity Flow; Pressure And Velocity Distributions

Two required VV ECMO for pneumonia, and one for airway surgery. All patients had a two-site approach. In two cases, drainage was initiated from the left side of the neck at the onset of therapy, with return to the groin. One patient required a change in the drainage cannula from the right to the left side during treatment, while the return continued to the groin.DiscussionMany centres have reported positive outcomes with alternative sites for cannulation in adults, including the left side of the neck. Alternative sites for cannulation require proper visualization techniques for guidewire and cannula insertion due to possible complications. We share our positive experience with left-sided cannulation using transthoracic echocardiographic visualization and a supraclavicular approach in paediatric patients of various weights.ConclusionLeft-sided cannulation is a safe option in specific clinical cases.

40283056,The Role of MDCT Coronary Angiography in the Detection of Benign Varieties and Anomalies of Coronary Blood Vessels-A Narrative Review. ,"Coronary arteries may vary in quantity, point of origin, or course. These variations fall under the category of anatomical variants/anomalies of the coronary arteries, representing congenital abnormalities of the coronary vascular system. Generally, they are benign, asymptomatic, and identified inadvertently during coronary angiography conducted for alternative indications. However, in some cases, the anomaly's characteristics or its interaction with surrounding structures may cause hemodynamic disturbances. These disturbances can lead to turbulent blood flow, which in turn poses an increased likelihood for the development of atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia. If symptomatic, potential manifestations include chest pain, arrhythmias, syncope, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. Given the potential for life-threatening complications in certain cases, the early and accurate diagnosis of coronary artery anomalies is of paramount importance. The most common diagnostic procedures used for the evaluation of coronary vessels are coronary angiography and multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography. MDCT angiography is a non-invasive, dependable, safe, and sensitive method for the detailed visualization of coronary anatomy. It offers high-resolution imaging that enables precise assessment of congenital coronary variations, aiding in both clinical decision-making and long-term patient management. We conducted a narrative review to analyze and integrate the body of literature on coronary artery varieties and anomalies. Our objective was to provide a comprehensive, albeit non-exhaustive, overview of essential concepts and findings related to their definition, classification, and detection with MDCT angiography. By integrating current knowledge in MDCT imaging, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of the clinical implications of coronary artery variations and their role in cardiovascular health.",Mladenovic Markovic A; Tomic A; Nisevic M; Parapid B; Boskovic N; Vitas M; Jevtovic M; Grujicic S,"Centre for Radiology and Magnetic Resonance Imaging, University Clinical Centre of Serbia, Pasterova 2, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025-04-21,10.3390/medicina61040765,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

40256819,"Current Landscape of Short-T2 Imaging Techniques in the Musculoskeletal System: The Past, Present and Future.","Conventional MRI is limited in imaging tissues with short T2 relaxation times, such as bone, ligaments, and cartilage, due to their rapid signal decay. This limitation has spurred the development of specialized MRI techniques designed specifically for short-T2 tissue imaging. Traditional pulse sequences, including three-dimensional gradient echo (3D-GRE), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), and Fast Field Echo Resembling a CT using Restricted Echo-Spacing (FRACTURE), initially addressed some of these challenges but often lacked sufficient resolution or contrast differentiation. Recent advancements, such as ultrashort echo time (UTE), zero echo time (ZTE), 3D-Bone, and synthetic computed tomography (sCT), have significantly enhanced the diagnostic capabilities of MRI by providing high-quality, CT-like visualization without exposure to ionizing radiation. These innovations have substantially improved MRI's ability to depict bone morphology, assess joint pathology, identify subtle fractures, and characterize bone tumors with higher accuracy. Beyond musculoskeletal applications, these techniques have demonstrated emerging clinical utility in additional domains, including pulmonary and dental imaging.

40274667,Leveraging CRISPR-Cas-Enhanced Isothermal Amplification Tools for Quick Identification of Pathogens Causing Livestock Diseases.,"Prompt and accurate diagnosis of infectious pathogens of livestock origin is of utmost importance for epidemiological surveillance and effective therapeutic strategy formulation. Among various methods, nucleic acid-based detection of pathogens is the most sensitive and specific; but the majority of these assays need expensive equipment and skilled workers. Due to the rapid advancement of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas)-based nucleic acid detection methods, these are now being widely used for pathogen detection. CRISPR-Cas is a bacterial counterpart of ""adaptive immunity"", generally used for editing genome. Many CRISPR systems have been modified for nucleic acid detection due to their excellent selectivity in detecting DNA and RNA sequences. The combination of CRISPR with suitable isothermal amplification technologies has made it more sensitive, specific, versatile, and reproducible for the detection of pathogen nucleic acids at the point of care. Amplification of pathogen nucleic acid by isothermal amplification followed by CRISPR-Cas-based detection has several advantages, including short sample-to-answer times and no requirement for laboratory set-up. They are also significantly less expensive than the existing nucleic acid detection methods.

40263181,FAPI-Targeted Molecular Imaging: Transforming Insights into Post-Ischemic Myocardial Remodeling?,"Post-ischemic myocardial remodeling significantly impacts clinical outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI), involving structural and functional changes such as ventricular dilation, infarct wall thinning, and fibrosis development. These processes, driven by inflammatory cascades, neurohormonal activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling, result in impaired cardiac output and an increased risk of heart failure. Imaging with fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool for assessing myocardial fibrosis via positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), targeting activated fibroblasts; the mediators of reparative and fibrotic processes. This innovative approach enables precise visualization and quantification of fibrosis dynamics, surpassing traditional imaging modalities. Preclinical studies using [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-FAPI PET/computed tomography (CT) demonstrated the tracer's specificity for fibroblast activation and its peak uptake in the infarct border zone at day 6 post-MI. These findings, corroborated by histology and autoradiography, highlight its potential for tracking reparative fibrosis. Clinical translation of FAPI imaging was recently achieved with [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), showing persistent fibroblast activity beyond infarct zones and strong correlations with myocardial injury markers. Complementary research on [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-HFAPi SPECT imaging in patients post-MI established its predictive value for left ventricular remodeling, emphasizing its cost-effectiveness and accessibility compared with PET.

Understanding the diverse courses and origins of the TMB is critical for minimizing surgical complications. Such knowledge not only aids in preoperative planning but also enhances the accuracy of nerve conduction tests, contributing to improved postoperative outcomes. The ability to visualize and assess the TMB using imaging modalities like ultrasound represents a significant advancement in diagnostic and surgical preparation. Ultrasound is an accessible, cost-effective, and dynamic imaging technique that allows for real-time evaluation of neural structures. It provides detailed visualization of the TMB and its anatomical variations, offering valuable information that can guide surgical approaches and reduce the risk of injury to this vital branch. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the anatomy, anatomical variants, and clinical significance of the TMB, with a particular focus on its assessment via ultrasound.

Rapid, early, and accurate diagnosis of the disease is important for the swift control of FMD. Although PCR-based assays are being used routinely for the effective diagnosis of FMD, these assays require sophisticated equipment, dedicated manpower, and complex procedures for the detection of amplified viral-genome. Colorimetric isothermal amplification assay with a sharp contrast in colour changes for the positive amplification of viral-genome would be qualified for quick and simple diagnosis of FMDV in both laboratory and field. Here, we report the development and evaluation of FMDV 2B-NSP coding region-based colorimetric RT-LAMP assay for pan-serotypic detection of viral-genome. Addition of 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as an additive, could reduce the detection time of the RT-LAMP assay from 60 to 30 min/reaction. Analytical sensitivity test showed that the RT-LAMP assay can detect up to 1000 copies of FMDV genome/reaction, simultaneously, the assay was found specific for the detection of FMDV genome as revealed on testing with serotypes O, A and Asia1 circulating in India during the last two decades. In addition, analysis of 312 clinical samples from various field outbreaks of FMDV in the country showed that RT-LAMP assay exhibited a sensitivity of 96.07%, and a specificity of 100% with an overall accuracy of 97.12%. Therefore, owing to the naked eye distinct visualization of amplified product (pink to yellow colour change), the RT-LAMP assay may facilitate rapid screening of FMD-suspected clinical samples without the use of hazardous DNA-binding dyes and simultaneously prevents aerosolization of amplified product, and subsequent carry over contamination in the diagnostic laboratory.",Biswal JK; Ranjan R; Mohapatra JK; Sahoo NR; Singh RP,"ICAR-National Institute on Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Arugul, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, 752050, India.

[64Cu]Cu-PSMA-Q was synthesized, purified, and subjected to comprehensive quality control. Its binding affinity, cellular uptake, and internalization were assessed in vitro using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive LNCaP C4-2B cells. In vivo toxicity studies were conducted in 12 mouse models (6 per group). Small-animal PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) imaging and biodistribution studies were performed on tumor-bearing mice. Clinical evaluation involved PET/CT imaging with [64Cu]Cu-PSMA-Q in 29 prostate cancer patients, with comparative analysis against [18F]FDG PET/CT imaging.

40273346,RH-RPA: A Rapid and Highly Sensitive Assay for Nucleic Acid Detection Based on RNase HII Combined with Recombinase Polymerase Amplification.,"Currently, RPA-exo and RPA-nfo are the primary methods for RPA/RT-RPA probe assays, both of which have been widely applied to the detection of various targets. However, RPA-nfo exhibits lower sensitivity compared with the exo probe method, while RPA-exo lacks the capability for equipment-free visualization inherent to RPA-nfo. Both of the approaches mentioned above limit the broader application of RPA/RT-RPA probe assays. To address those limitations, we have developed a novel recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with an <i><i>E. coli</i></i> RNase HII assay (RH-RPA). This approach supports both fluorescence signal detection and lateral-flow strip readouts. Due to the high efficiency and specificity of <i><i>E. coli</i></i> RNase HII in recognizing and cleaving targets, this method serves as a rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic platform. Under the fluorescence detection mode, RH-RPA achieves a limit of detection as low as 10 copies per reaction for both DNA and RNA within 20 min. Additionally, the lateral-flow strip mode enables the detection of as few as 5 copies per reaction of nucleic acids within 20 min. In clinical sample analysis, the RT RH-RPA demonstrated 100% accuracy in detecting the influenza A virus, underscoring its reliability in practical diagnostics.

Although MR-guided needle placement offers several distinct advantages, such as high-resolution target visualization and accurate device tracking, one of the primary limitations that affect its widespread adoption is the ergonomic constraints of the closed-bore MRI environment, requiring the patients to be frequently moved in and out to perform the needle-based procedures. This paper introduces a low-profile, body-mounted, MR-guided robot designed to address this limitation by streamlining the operation workflow and enabling accurate needle placement within the MRI scanner.<h4>Methods</h4>The robot employs piezoelectric linear actuators and stacked Cartesian XY stages to precisely control the position and orientation of a needle guide. A kinematic model and control framework was developed to facilitate accurate targeting. Additionally, clinical workflow for the liver interventions was developed to demonstrate the robot's capability to replicate existing procedures. The proposed system was validated in benchtop environment and 3T MRI scanner to quantify the system performance.<h4>Results</h4>Experimental validations conducted in free space demonstrated a position accuracy of 2.38 ± 0.94 mm and orientation error of 1.40 ± 2.89°. Additional tests to confirm MR-conditionality and MR-guided phantom placements were carried out to assess the system's performance and safety in MRI suite, yielding a position error of 2.01 ± 0.77 mm and an orientation error of 1.57 ± 1.31°.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The presented robot shows exceptional compatibility with a wide range of patients and bore sizes while maintaining clinically significant accuracy. Future work will focus on the validations in dynamic liver environments.",Wilcox S; Sengupta S; Huang C; Tokuda J; Lu A; Woodrum D; Chen Y,"Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Machines, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, USA.",Annals of biomedical engineering,2025-04-23,10.1007/s10439-025-03719-w,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),MRI; Mr-guided Procedures; Percutaneous Needle Intervention
40266001,Design and Implementation of a Multi-Center Trial of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe Gas Exchange MRI and MRS to Evaluate Longitudinal Progression of COPD.,"MR imaging holds the potential to enhance drug development efficiency by de-risking early phase studies and increasing confidence in results. It can improve patient selection, increase repeatability, and provide greater sensitivity to change, thereby enabling smaller, faster clinical trials. For trials in the pulmonary space, hyperpolarized <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI is appealing because it provides 3-dimensional imaging of pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange in a brief, non-invasive exam. Metrics derived from <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI may be more sensitive to disease progression than conventional lung function assessments and may thus provide a valuable means to evaluate numerous novel pharmacologic and biologic therapies now in development. However, despite the acute need for better patient selection and for prognostic and monitoring biomarkers, <sup>129</sup>Xe MR imaging is not yet widely utilized in pulmonary drug development, partly because such trials must be conducted at multiple centers to enroll enough participants. Thus, incorporating <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI requires broader dissemination, harmonized image acquisition protocols, standardized dose delivery, visualization, and quantification. Multi-site trials must also be able to operate across all major MRI vendor platforms and diverse software/hardware revisions. To this end, the <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI Clinical trials consortium has published a harmonized protocol describing four recommended acquisitions. Here we report on the first industry-sponsored study to deploy this <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI/MRS protocol in a multi-center, multi-platform, multi-national study to evaluate longitudinal progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We demonstrate the steps necessary to implement standardized <sup>129</sup>Xe-MRI acquisition techniques across multiple sites and discuss the practices implemented, quality control approaches, and lessons learned for facilitating and accelerating the implementation of future trials that incorporate this technology.

40287445,Antibacterial and anti-virulence activity of eco-friendly resveratrol-loaded lipid nanocapsules against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. ,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is challenging modern antimicrobial therapy due to its high antimicrobial resistance. Nutraceuticals have gained a lot of interest and their incorporation into nanoparticles further improves their efficacy. This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of linalool-based lipid nanocapsules loaded with resveratrol (LIN-LNC-RES) as a synergistic strategy against MRSA. LIN-LNC-RES were prepared by the phase inversion temperature method and characterized for their colloidal properties, in vitro release, and stability. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against S. aureus and different MRSA clinical isolates were investigated. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging for visualization of biofilm formation and bacterial membrane integrity as well as mechanistic investigation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis were performed. LIN-LNCs-RES demonstrated favorable properties with a size of 35.19 ± 0.72 nm, PDI of 0.09 ± 0.02 and a zeta potential of -2.53 ± 0.07 mV with RES 98% EE. They showed a controlled release of RES over 24 h and were stable at 4 °C for 3 months. Compared to free drug, LIN-LNC-RES showed a 4-fold decrease in MIC values and 10-fold decrease in half maximal biofilm inhibitory concentration value. Biofilm eradication assay showed superiority of LIN-LNC-RES over RES against all isolates with disrupted bacterial membranes as revealed by SEM. Mechanistically, qRT-PCR showed that LIN-LNC-RES significantly reduced RNAIII gene expression as well as the expression of SaeRS two component system, potentially affecting quorum sensing and virulence factors expression. RES-loaded LIN-based nanosystem offers a great potential for combating MRSA infections, neutralizing its virulence activity hence, overcoming antimicrobial resistance.",Dogheim GM; Shehat MG; Mahdy DM; Barakat HS; Abouelfetouh A; Ramadan AA,"Pharmaceutics department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Alexandria University, Alexandria, 21521, Egypt.",Scientific reports,2025-04-26,10.1038/s41598-025-95343-w,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40269401,The efficacy of 3D hologram support with mixed-reality technique in pancreatobiliary endoscopy.,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>Mixed-reality (MR) technology is an advanced holographic imaging system that uses wearable devices to display three-dimensional (3D) images in clinical environments. In pancreatobiliary endoscopy, MR technology can facilitate 3D visualization of the bile and pancreatic ducts, enhancing spatial awareness and providing a more intuitive understanding of the anatomy. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of 3D hologram support (3D-HS) using MR in pancreatobiliary endoscopy.<h4>Methods</h4>This study included 30 patients who underwent pancreatobiliary endoscopy using 3D-HS between June 2023 and July 2024. The procedures included ERCP (n = 13) and interventional EUS (iEUS) (n = 17). The primary outcome was technical success, with secondary outcomes including total procedure-related time and adverse events. The conventional treatment group, matched for age and disease type, was compared to the 3D-HS group. a questionnaire was used to evaluate the MR device, 3D hologram images, and the overall evaluation with 3D-HS.<h4>Results</h4>The overall technical success rate was 96.7% (ERCP, 100%; iEUS, 93.8%). Adverse events occurred in 16.7% of cases; all were managed conservatively. comparison with conventional treatment showed no significant differences in outcomes, although conventional methods had shorter procedural times (p < 0.05). The questionnaire results indicated positive feedback on operability and image quality of 3D-HS, with enhanced anatomical understanding relative to 2D imaging, although some ERCP cases received lower ratings, particularly for intrahepatic bile duct stones.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Pancreatobiliary endoscopy using 3D-HS can be safe and effective in enhancing anatomical understanding. Further studies are needed to optimize its use and reduce the total procedure time.",Nagai K; Sugimoto M; Itoi T; Minami H; Tsuchiya T; Araki Y; Tonozuka R; Kojima H; Hirakawa N; Orihara S,"Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,2025-04-23,10.1002/jhbp.12136,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),MR; ERCP; Vr; Mixed Reality; 3D Hologram
40030667,Breast Coil Optimization for Low Field MRI and Future MR-Guided Proton Therapy.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Ultra-low field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging of the breast and chest wall was conducted using optimized radiofrequency (RF) coil designs, and to explore future applications in MR-guided proton therapy (MRgPT), simulation studies of a pencil proton beam trajectory in low and ULFs were conducted.<h4>Methods</h4>The focus in this study is the RF coil design, which is approached as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and solved using a defined performance metric and Pareto optimality formalism. Our winding pattern algorithm was developed to simultaneously optimize the coil's magnetic field homogeneity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and magnetic field drop-off into the chest wall for improved imaging of organs-at-risk. Five single-channel, transmit/receive breast-shaped RF coils were constructed. 3D phantom MRI was performed at 6.5 mT to evaluate field homogeneity and SNR. The first in vivo breast imaging at 6.5 mT was conducted. Monte Carlo simulations were employed to investigate the effects of copper wire and static field strengths on proton beam deflection.<h4>Results</h4>The MOO method was validated - the observed field homogeneity, the relative ratio of SNRs, and the MRI chest signal agreed for all coils with the simulations. In vivo imaging revealed good breast tissue contrast and clear heart visualization. Our findings indicated that a ∼50 mT field with ∼10 mT/m gradient strengths can minimize proton beam deflection, achieving ∼2 × 2 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup> spatial resolution within minutes, supporting the clinical feasibility of MRgPT.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our MOO method can be used to design breast coils that meet a wide range of imaging requirements..",Hornung TPP; Koonjoo N; Shen S; Longarino FK; Keenan KE; Yan S; Bortfeld TR; Rosen MS,,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2025-04-22,10.1109/tbme.2024.3520895,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40281504,Qualitative analysis and exploration of anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of a Thai traditional medicine formula from Wat Pho beyond its use for COVID-19 treatment. ,"Ya-Kao (YK) is a traditional Thai medicine used to relieve fever and consists of 14 crude drugs. It has been recommended by Thai folk healers and the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine for COVID-19 treatment, with clinical studies conducted to assess its efficacy. However, scientific evidence on its biological properties remains limited. This study aims to explore the quality aspect of YK and evaluate its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. The quality aspect of the YK formula was assessed using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Agar disc diffusion and TLC bioautography were used for antibacterial activity, while anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by measuring nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. The HPTLC method, utilizing a developing system of toluene, ethyl acetate, and formic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v), was successfully developed for the authentication of YK crude drugs. This method provides the most distinct fingerprint pattern of the components within the YK formulation, enabling clear visualization of its constituent. Additionally, it enables preliminary identification of phenolics, terpenes, and steroids, providing valuable insight into the formulation's chemical composition. The antibacterial activity of YK was evaluated using the disk diffusion assay, and it was found that the lime juice extract of the YK formula (LYK) exhibited the largest zone of inhibition against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, particularly those pathogenic to the respiratory tract. Additionally, the antibacterial activity was evaluated using TLC bioautography, and the results indicated that the methanolic extract of YK (MYK) exhibited an inhibition zone against Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae. It was found that several compounds displayed an inhibition zone. Furthermore, the YK extract with methanol, water, and lime juice exhibited significant anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing NO accumulation in LPS-stimulated macrophage cells (p < 0.05). This study is the first to standardize YK raw materials using HPTLC and evaluate the biological properties of each crude drug and the combined formula. The developed HPTLC method ensures accurate identification of YK raw materials, preventing the use of incorrect ingredients. Additionally, the pharmacological findings confirm YK's anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities, particularly against respiratory pathogens linked to COVID-19.",Perstwong N; Binalee A; Kobtrakul K; Phongsopitanun W; Sanookpan K; Areecheewakul S; Buranasudja V; Vimolmangkang S,"Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,2025-04-25,10.1186/s12906-025-04873-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40266709,Novel Wash-In Characteristics of Background Parenchymal Enhancement on Ultrafast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Breast MRI.,"<b>Background -</b> Ultrafast MRI (UFMRI) can minimize background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), improve cancer visualization, and inform characterization of malignancy. Although BPE is a biomarker for breast cancer risk, washin characteristics of BPE are unknown. <b>Objective -</b> The purpose of this study was to delineate wash-in behavior of normal BPE in healthy women on UFMRI and determine association with patient characteristics. <b>Methods -</b> This retrospective study evaluated consecutive normal screening breast MRI examinations (BI-RADS category 1) (January 2020 to May 2022) with 1 year of negative follow-up MRI. Characteristics including age, menopausal status, and cancer risk factors were recorded. Fibroglandular tissue and BPE on conventional postcontrast sequences were documented. UFMR images were analyzed for level, time to enhancement (TTE), and maximum slope (MS) of BPE as indicators of wash-in characteristics. Ordinal logistic regressions were conducted using a significance level of .05 (two-sided). <b>Results -</b> The final sample included 222 women (median age, 50 years; range, 25-81 years): 110 (49.5%) premenopausal and 112 (50.5%) postmenopausal. BPE was lower on UFMRI than on conventional MRI in 98.5% of examinations with moderate or marked BPE and 85.4% of examinations with mild to marked BPE on conventional postcontrast images (p < .001). BPE on UFMRI was marked in 0% and moderate in 4.1% of examinations. BPE was significantly associated with menopausal status, inversely related to age, and significantly associated with TTE. The odds of high BPE on UFMRI were 7.815 times greater in premenopausal women (95% CI, 4.461-13.689) (p < .001), 1.067 times less per 1-year increase in age (95% CI, 1.046-10.890) (p < .001), and 1.113 times greater per 1-second decrease in TTE (95% CI, 1.589-6.383) (p = .01). MS was higher in premenopausal women but was not statistically significant. BPE was not associated with cancer risk factors. <b>Conclusion -</b> UFMRI mitigates BPE, essentially eliminating marked and moderate BPE. TTE varies by age and menopausal status, suggesting hormonal underpinning. <b>Clinical impact -</b> Minimizing BPE on UFMRI could improve diagnostic accuracy. Wash-in kinetic parameters of BPE have potential to serve as biomarkers in breast cancer risk prediction.",Noorily AR; Heller SL; Regen-Tuero HC; Li X; Goldberg JD; Gao Y,"NYU Langone Health, Department of Radiology, 660 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016.",AJR.

40285870,"Mobile air monitoring to identify volatile organic compound distributions and potential hazard during the remediation of the East Palestine, Ohio train derailment. ","On February 3, 2023, a train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Initial mobile air monitoring in mid-February 2023 revealed unique spatiotemporal patterns for a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To determine long-term impacts on air quality, two follow up mobile air monitoring campaigns were carried out in March and April 2023 on public roadways using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer. This study aimed to characterize VOC distributions, identify hotspots, and characterize potential hazards. Concentrations of targeted VOCs benzene, toluene, and xylenes were lower overall in East Palestine in April compared to March. Overall, more compounds (n = 48) were identified using non-targeted analysis (NTA) in East Palestine in March compared with April (n = 30). Several of these VOCs were uniquely identified during March sampling, and among the commonly detected compounds, higher average concentrations were observed in East Palestine compared background levels. Spatial analysis revealed similar patterns of hotspots for benzene and additional VOCs identified from NTA, including C3H4O, C4H8O, and C6H12O. Using the EPA Hazard Comparison Dashboard, 49% and 40% of the identified VOCs were classified as ""very high"" or ""high"" hazards for eye and skin irritation, respectively. Notably, eye and skin irritation were among the common symptoms reported by the residents near the disaster site. Additionally, 29%, 18%, and 14% of the identified VOCs were classified as ""very high"" or ""high"" hazards for genotoxicity/mutagenicity, acute inhalation toxicity, and acute dermal toxicity, respectively. Collectively, these findings provide exposure data supportive of the reported health concerns and demonstrate the application of mobile monitoring coupled with NTA as a novel approach for rapid identification and mapping of potentially hazardous chemicals following an environmental disaster.",Saitas M; Mustapha T; Vitucci E; Oladeji O; Tsai HD; Cannon C; Rusyn I; Presto AA; Chiu WA; Johnson NM,"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Interdisciplinary Faculty of Toxicology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.",Environmental monitoring and assessment,2025-04-26,10.1007/s10661-025-14038-x,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
40262133,Effectiveness of a Mobile Phone-Delivered Multiple Health Behavior Change Intervention (LIFE4YOUth) in Adolescents: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>Although mobile health (mHealth) interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in modifying 1 or 2 health-risk behaviors at a time, there is a knowledge gap regarding the effects of stand-alone mHealth interventions on multiple health risk behaviors.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to estimate the 2- and 4-month effectiveness of an mHealth intervention (LIFE4YOUth) targeting alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity, and smoking among Swedish high school students, compared with a waiting-list control condition.<h4>Methods</h4>A 2-arm parallel group, single-blind randomized controlled trial (1:1) was conducted from September 2020 to June 2023. Eligibility criteria included nonadherence to guidelines related to the primary outcomes, such as weekly alcohol consumption (standard drinks), monthly frequency of heavy episodic drinking (ie, ≥4 standard drinks), daily intake of fruit and vegetables (100-g portions), weekly consumption of sugary drinks (33-cL servings), weekly duration of moderate to vigorous physical activity (minutes), and 4-week point prevalence of smoking abstinence. The intervention group had 16 weeks of access to LIFE4YOUth, a fully automated intervention including recurring screening, text message services, and a web-based dashboard. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted on available and imputed 2- and 4-month self-reported data from participants at risk for each outcome respectively, at baseline. Effects were estimated using multilevel models with adaptive intercepts (per individual) and time by group interactions, adjusted for baseline age, sex, household economy, and self-perceived importance, confidence, and know-how to change behaviors. Bayesian inference with standard (half-)normal priors and null-hypothesis testing was used to estimate the parameters of statistical models.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 756 students (aged 15-20, mean 17.1, SD 1.2 years; 69%, 520/756 females; 31%, 236/756 males) from high schools across Sweden participated in the trial. Follow-up surveys were completed by 71% (539/756) of participants at 2 months and 57% (431/756) of participants at 4 months. Most participants in the intervention group (219/377, 58%) engaged with the intervention at least once. At 2 months, results indicated positive effects in the intervention group, with complete case data indicating median between-group differences in fruit and vegetable consumption (0.32 portions per day, 95% CI 0.13-0.52), physical activity (50 minutes per week, 95% CI -0.2 to 99.7), and incidence rate ratio for heavy episodic drinking (0.77, 95% CI 0.55-1.07). The odds ratio for smoking abstinence (1.09, 95% CI 0.34-3.64), incidence rate ratio for weekly alcohol consumption (0.69, 95% CI 0.27-1.83), and the number of sugary drinks consumed weekly (0.89, 95% CI 0.73-1.1) indicated inconclusive evidence for effects due to uncertainty in the estimates. At 4 months, a remaining effect was observed on physical activity only.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although underpowered, our findings suggest modest short-term effects of the LIFE4YOUth intervention, primarily on physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Our results provide inconclusive evidence regarding weekly alcohol consumption and smoking abstinence.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN34468623; https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN34468623.",Seiterö A; Henriksson P; Thomas K; Henriksson H; Löf M; Bendtsen M; Müssener U,"Department of Health, Medicine and Caring Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-04-22,10.2196/69425,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Randomized controlled trial; Public Health; Telemedicine; High School Students; Mhealth; Digital Behavior Change Intervention; Multiple Behavior
