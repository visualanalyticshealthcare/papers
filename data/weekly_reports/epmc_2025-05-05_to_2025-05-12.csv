40325596,An Overdose Forecasting Dashboard for Local Harm-Reduction Response.,"As the United States grapples with an ongoing overdose crisis, states and jurisdictions are adopting novel approaches to reduce overdose mortality. In one novel approach, public health researchers and leaders in Rhode Island leveraged the state's robust surveillance data and collaborations between government, academic, and community-based organizations (CBOs) to launch the PROVIDENT (PReventing OVerdose using Information and Data from the EnvironmeNT) project, a population-based randomized controlled research trial (NCT05096429) in December 2019. The PROVIDENT trial utilizes machine learning (ML) methods to identify neighborhoods at risk of future overdose deaths at the census-block-group level to inform community-level overdose prevention resource distribution. To disseminate the ML model predictions, our research team developed an interactive, online mapping dashboard in close collaboration with three statewide CBOs. We measured whether these organizations utilized the PROVIDENT dashboard to allocate harm-reduction services based on ML model predictions and collected information about their data-driven decision-making processes. This case study describes how we assembled and piloted this overdose forecasting dashboard for use by CBOs between November 2021 and August 2024. By measuring dashboard logins, completed surveys, and engagement with ongoing training, we illustrate how organizations utilized ML and surveillance data to inform their outreach efforts and generate valuable insights at a neighborhood level.",Krieger M; Yedinak J; Duong E; Macmadu A; Skinner A; Allen B; Pratty C; Ahern J; Cerdá M; Marshall BDL,"Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, USA.",Health promotion practice,2025-05-05,10.1177/15248399251335620,16.4,"visualization(kw); dashboard(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw); machine learning(kw,abstract); data(kw,abstract)",GIS; Forecasting; Data Visualization; Machine Learning; Neighborhood; Predictive Analytics; Overdose Prevention; Community Organizations; Data Dashboard
40341667,A digital intelligence visualization health monitoring device for Alzheimer's disease patients based on WBAN technology.,"Continuous visual health monitoring for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as a lifelong degenerative neurological disorder, is increasingly emphasized in medicine and design. Meanwhile, wireless body area network (WBAN) technology, built on the Internet of Things (IoT), has been widely used in passive human health monitoring through convolutional neural algorithms. However, it is unclear whether the multimodal data collected by WBAN and its visualization and analysis allow AD patients to be more active in their own health and enhance stakeholders' care for AD patients compared to traditional active health monitoring. Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate this question and a 12-month controlled trial was conducted.16 AD patients collaborated with us and were divided into a traditional physical examination visualization group and a WBAN monitoring visualization group. In the WBAN monitoring visualization group, we innovated a digital kit called AD-Cloud, which consists of a flexible wearable data collection and transmission device with a star topology, a progressive convolutional neural framework for remote data visualization with high arithmetic power, and an interactive mobile application. It is worth emphasizing that we have innovated visualization analysis and presentation methods for behavioral, physiological and psychological as well as WBAN techniques and Progressive Region Enhancement Network (PRENet) for AD patients. Finally, it is shown that in the field of health monitoring visualization, innovative monitoring visualization devices based on WBAN technology are more positive for AD patients than traditional routine medical examinations. Also, the results show that personalized interpretable and recognizable health data allow AD patients to reduce anxiety about their health and adjust their poor physical condition and increase their interest in socializing. Ultimately, by continuously enriching the e-cases of AD patients, AD patients will be able to quickly access effective health support based on the digital ecosystem in the future.",Zheng M; Wu Y; Weng C,"Fuzhou University of International Studies and Trade, Changle District, Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China. zhengminghong@fzfu.edu.cn.",Scientific reports,2025-05-08,10.1038/s41598-025-99637-x,13.0,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Alzheimer’s disease; Data Visualization; Health Monitoring; Wireless Body Area Network; Multimodal Data
40344668,Cocreating the Visualization of Digital Mobility Outcomes: Delphi-Type Process With Patients.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent technological advances in wearable devices offer new potential for measuring mobility in real-world contexts. Mobilise-D has validated digital mobility outcomes to provide novel outcomes and end points in clinical research of 4 different long-term health conditions (Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and proximal femoral fracture). These outcomes also provide unique information that is important to patients; however, there is limited literature that explores the optimal methods to achieve this, such as the best way to visualize patients' data.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to identify meaningful outcomes for each condition and how to best visualize them from the perspective of end users.<h4>Methods</h4>Using a Delphi-type protocol with patients as subject matter experts, we gathered iterative feedback on the cocreation of visualizations through 3 rounds of questionnaires. An open-ended questionnaire was used in round 1 to understand what aspects of mobility were most influenced by their health condition. These responses were mapped onto relevant digital mobility outcomes and walking experiences and then prioritized for visualization. Using patient responses, we worked alongside researchers, clinicians, and a patient advisory group to develop visualizations that depicted a week of mobility data. During rounds 2 and 3, participants rated usefulness and ease of understanding on a 5-point Likert scale and provided unstructured feedback in comment boxes for each visualization. Visualizations were refined using the feedback from round 2 before receiving further feedback in round 3.<h4>Results</h4>Participation varied across rounds 1 to 3 (n=48, n=79, and n=78, respectively). Round 1 identified important outcomes and contexts for each health condition, such as walking speed and stride length for people with Parkinson disease or multiple sclerosis and number of steps for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or proximal femoral fracture. The consensus was not reached for any visualization reviewed in round 2 or 3. Feedback was generally positive, and some participants reported that they were able to understand the visualization and interpret what the visualization represented.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through the feedback provided and existing data visualization principles, we developed recommendations for future visualizations of mobility- and health-related data. Visualizations should be readable by ensuring that large and clear fonts are used and should be friendly for people with vision impairments, such as color blindness. Patients have a strong understanding of their own condition and its variability; hence, adding additional factors into visualizations is recommended to better reflect the nuances of a condition. Ensuring that outcomes and visualizations are meaningful requires close collaboration with patients throughout the development process.",Lumsdon J; Wilson C; Alcock L; Becker C; Benvenuti F; Bonci T; van den Brande K; Brittain G; Brown P; Buckley E; Caruso M; Caulfield B; Cereatti A; Delgado-Ortiz L; Del Din S; Evers J; Garcia-Aymerich J; Gaßner H; Gur Arieh T; Hansen C; Hausdorff JM; Hiden H; Hume E; Kirk C; Maetzler W; Megaritis D; Rochester L; Scott K; Sharrack B; Sutton N; Vereijken B; Vogiatzis I; Yarnall A; Keogh A; Cantu A,"Population Health Sciences Institute, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.",JMIR formative research,2025-05-09,10.2196/68782,13.0,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Mobility; Data Visualization; Wearable Devices; Cocreation; Digital Mobility Outcomes

40339524,Review learning: Real world validation of privacy preserving continual learning across medical institutions.,"When a deep learning model is trained sequentially on different datasets, it often forgets the knowledge learned from previous data, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. This damages the model's performance on diverse datasets, which is critical in privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL) applications based on transfer learning (TL). To overcome this, we introduce ""review learning"" (RevL), a low cost continual learning algorithm for diagnosis prediction using electronic health records (EHR) within a PPDL framework. RevL generates data samples from the model which are used to review knowledge from previous datasets. Six simulated institutional experiments and one real-world experiment involving three medical institutions were conducted to validate RevL, using three binary classification EHR data. In the real-world experiment with data from 106,508 patients, the mean global area under the receiver operating curve was 0.710 for RevL and 0.655 for TL. These results demonstrate RevL's ability to retain previously learned knowledge and its effectiveness in real-world PPDL scenarios. Our work establishes a realistic pipeline for PPDL research based on model transfers across institutions and highlights the practicality of continual learning in real-world medical settings using private EHR data.",Yoo J; Choi S; Yang YS; Kim S; Choi J; Lim D; Lim Y; Joo HJ; Kim DJ; Park RW; Yoon HJ; Kim K,"School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Republic of Korea.",Computers in biology and medicine,2025-05-07,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.110239,10.0,"visualization(kw); visual(kw); data(abstract); electronic health record(kw,abstract)",Electronic Health Record; Continual Learning; Feature Visualization; Knowledge Distillation; Privacy Preserving Deep Learning; Real World Validation; Generative Replay
40346656,The TyphiNET data visualisation dashboard: unlocking Salmonella Typhi genomics data to support public health.,"<h4>Background</h4>Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (abbreviated as 'Typhi') is the bacterial agent of typhoid fever. Effective antimicrobial therapy reduces complications and mortality; however, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major problem in many endemic countries. Prevention through vaccination is possible through recently-licensed typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs). National immunisation programs are currently being considered or deployed in several countries where AMR prevalence is known to be high, and the Gavi vaccine alliance has provided financial support for their introduction. Pathogen whole genome sequence data are a rich source of information on Typhi variants (genotypes or lineages), AMR prevalence, and mechanisms. However, this information is currently not readily accessible to non-genomics experts, including those driving vaccine implementation or empirical therapy guidance.<h4>Results</h4>We developed TyphiNET ( https://www.typhi.net ), an interactive online dashboard for exploring Typhi genotype and AMR distributions derived from publicly available pathogen genome sequences. TyphiNET allows users to explore country-level summaries such as the frequency of pathogen lineages, temporal trends in resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials, and the specific variants and mechanisms underlying emergent AMR trends. User-driven plots and session reports can be downloaded for ease of sharing. Importantly, TyphiNET is populated by high-quality genome data curated by the Global Typhoid Pathogen Genomics Consortium, analysed using the Pathogenwatch platform, and identified as coming from non-targeted sampling frames that are suitable for estimating AMR prevalence amongst Typhi infections (no personal data is included in the platform). As of February 2024, data from a total of n = 11,836 genomes from 101 countries are available in TyphiNET. We outline case studies illustrating how the dashboard can be used to explore these data and gain insights of relevance to both researchers and public health policy-makers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The TyphiNET dashboard provides an interactive platform for accessing genome-derived data on pathogen variant frequencies to inform typhoid control and intervention strategies. The platform is extensible in terms of both data and features, and provides a model for making complex bacterial genome-derived data accessible to a wide audience.",Dyson ZA; Cerdeira L; Sharma V; Carey ME; Holt KE; ,"Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, WC1E 7HT, UK. zoe.dyson@lshtm.ac.uk.",Genome medicine,2025-05-09,10.1186/s13073-025-01470-4,9.8,"dashboard(kw,title,abstract); visual(title); data(title,abstract)",Genetic epidemiology; Salmonella typhi; Genomics; Antimicrobial resistance; Surveillance; Typhoid fever; Web Application; Whole Genome Sequencing; Dashboard

40341099,Review and Comparative Evaluation of Mobile Apps for Cardiovascular Risk Estimation: Usability Evaluation Using mHealth App Usability Questionnaire.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and their prevention is a major public health priority. Detecting health issues early and assessing risk levels can significantly improve the chances of reducing mortality. Mobile apps can help estimate and manage CVD risks by providing users with personalized feedback, education, and motivation. Incorporating visual analysis into apps is an effective method for educating society. However, the usability evaluation and inclusion of visualization of these apps are often unclear and variable.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary objective of this study is to review and compare the usability of existing apps designed to estimate CVD risk using the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ). This is not a traditional usability study involving user interaction design, but rather an assessment of how effectively these applications meet usability standards as defined by the MAUQ.<h4>Methods</h4>First, we used predefined criteria to review 16 out of 2238 apps to estimate CVD risk in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. Based on the apps' characteristics (ie, developed for health care professionals or patient use) and their functions (single or multiple CVD risk calculators), we conducted a descriptive analysis. Then we also compared the usability of existing apps using the MAUQ and calculated the agreement among 3 expert raters.<h4>Results</h4>Most apps used the Framingham Risk Score (8/16, 50%) and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk (7/16, 44%) prognostic models to estimate CVD risk. The app with the highest overall MAUQ score was the MDCalc Medical Calculator (mean 6.76, SD 0.25), and the lowest overall MAUQ score was obtained for the CardioRisk Calculator (mean 3.96, SD 0.21). The app with the highest overall MAUQ score in the ""ease-of-use"" domain was the MDCalc Medical Calculator (mean 7, SD 0); in the domain ""interface and satisfaction,"" it was the MDCalc Medical Calculator (mean 6.67, SD 0.33); and in the domain ""usefulness,"" it was the ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus (mean 6.80, SD 0.32).<h4>Conclusions</h4>We found that the Framingham Risk Score is the most widely used prognostic model in apps for estimating CVD risk. The ""ease-of-use"" domain received the highest ratings. While more than half of the apps were suitable for both health care professionals and patients, only a few offered sophisticated visualizations for assessing CVD risk. Less than a quarter of the apps included visualizations, and those that did were single calculators. Our analysis of apps showed that they are an appropriate tool for estimating CVD risk.",Svenšek A; Gosak L; Lorber M; Štiglic G; Fijačko N,"Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Maribor, Žitna ulica 15, Maribor, 2000, Slovenia, 386 2 300 4762.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2025-05-08,10.2196/56466,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Cardiovascular diseases; Visualization; Prisma; Mobile Applications; Prognostic Models; Mauq
40323727,Building a dashboard to inform policy and clinical practice using the Irish epilepsy electronic patient record: Towards a learning health system.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Ireland lags heavily in capacity and stakeholder interest for the development of learning health system tools. However, Ireland possesses a rich repository of electronic patient records for epilepsy patients stored at the National Epilepsy Centre at Beaumont Hospital. The objective of the current study was to develop a prototype dashboard from anonymized electronic records of Irish epilepsy patients to demonstrate the potential for the development of learning health systems in Ireland.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional extract of electronic patient records was extracted from the Irish National Epilepsy Centre. Extracted data were then used to construct a prototype clinical dashboard based on iterative feedback provided by relevant stakeholders. As proof-of-concept, a mock analysis was performed using the EpiData Dashboard to identify the number of women of childbearing age (16-45 years) who are currently prescribed sodium valproate.<h4>Results</h4>A prototype clinical dashboard called the EpiData Dashboard was produced with four distinct tabs (homepage, patient demographic information, patient diagnosis information and patient medication information) based on stakeholder feedback.<h4>Significance</h4>The EpiData Dashboard enables group-level analysis of information contained within epilepsy electronic patient records in a straightforward and accessible way. The development of the EpiData Dashboard demonstrates that the capacity to develop learning health system tools in Ireland can be informative for policy and epilepsy clinical care. This demonstration can drive stakeholder engagement to develop more enhanced and integrated tools to improve the capacity of epilepsy care.<h4>Plain language summary</h4>Electronic patient records are useful for storing and sharing patient data between clinicians and represent data repositories that can be leveraged to enhance healthcare policy and clinical care. Ireland lacks in leveraging electronic patient resources. The current study produced a prototype analysis tool using electronic patient records from a national epilepsy center.

40345352,MRI-Based Multimodal AI Model Enables Prediction of Recurrence Risk and Adjuvant Therapy in Breast Cancer.,"Timely intervention and improved prognosis for breast cancer patients rely on early metastasis risk detection and accurate treatment predictions. This study introduces an advanced multimodal MRI and AI-driven 3D deep learning model, termed the 3D-MMR-model, designed to predict recurrence risk in non-metastatic breast cancer patients. We conducted a multicenter study involving 1,199 non-metastatic breast cancer patients from four institutions in China, with comprehensive MRI and clinical data retrospectively collected. Our model employed multimodal-data fusion, utilizing contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1+C) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) volumes, processed through a modified 3D-UNet for tumor segmentation and a DenseNet121-based architecture for disease-free survival (DFS) prediction. Additionally, we performed RNA-seq analysis to delve further into the relationship between concentrated hotspots within the tumor region and the tumor microenvironment. The 3D-MR-model demonstrated superior predictive performance, with time-dependent ROC analysis yielding AUC values of 0.90, 0.89, and 0.88 for 2-, 3-, and 4-year DFS predictions, respectively, in the training cohort. External validation cohorts corroborated these findings, highlighting the model's robustness across diverse clinical settings. Integration of clinicopathological features further enhanced the model's accuracy, with a multimodal approach significantly improving risk stratification and decision-making in clinical practice. Visualization techniques provided insights into the decision-making process, correlating predictions with tumor microenvironment characteristics. In summary, the 3D-MMR-model represents a significant advancement in breast cancer prognosis, combining cutting-edge AI technology with multimodal imaging to deliver precise and clinically relevant predictions of recurrence risk.

40326493,&lt;i&gt;Ontolomics-P&lt;/i&gt;: Advancing Proteomics Data Interpretation through GPT-4o Reannotated Topic Ontology and Data-Driven Analysis.,"The interpretation of proteomics data often relies on functional enrichment analysis, such as Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, to uncover the biological functions of proteins, as well as the examination of protein expression patterns across data sets like the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) database. However, conventional approaches to functional enrichment frequently produce extensive and redundant term lists, complicating interpretation and synthesis. Moreover, the absence of specialized tools tailored to proteomics researchers limits the efficient exploration of protein expression within specific biological contexts. To address these challenges, we developed <i>Ontolomics-P</i>, a user-friendly web-based tool designed to advance proteomics data interpretation. <i>Ontolomics-P</i> integrates topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with GO semantic similarity analysis, enabling the consolidation of redundant terms into coherent topics. These topics are further refined and reannotated using the GPT-4o language model, creating a novel topics database that provides precise and interpretable insights into shared biological functions. Additionally, <i>Ontolomics-P</i> incorporates quantitative proteomic data from 10 diverse cancer types archived in the CPTAC database, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of protein expression profiles from a data-driven perspective. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate the tool's capacity to streamline workflows, simplify interpretation, and provide actionable biological insights. <i>Ontolomics-P</i> represents a significant advancement in proteomics data analysis, offering innovative solutions for functional annotation, quantitative exploration, and visualization, ultimately empowering researchers to accelerate discoveries in systems biology and beyond.",Yang Y; Wang S; Chen Y; Wang X; Jiang W; Jin Y; Zeng W; Wu D; Shen B; Yang H,"Liver Surgery and NHC Key Lab of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, Regenerative Medical Research Center, Department of Clinical Research Management, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.",Analytical chemistry,2025-05-06,10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00390,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
40341005,The SPHN Schema Forge - transform healthcare semantics from human-readable to machine-readable by leveraging semantic web technologies.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) adopted the Resource Description Framework (RDF), a core component of the Semantic Web technology stack, for the formal encoding and exchange of healthcare data in a medical knowledge graph. The SPHN RDF Schema defines the semantics on how data elements should be represented. While RDF is proven to be machine readable and interpretable, it can be challenging for individuals without specialized background to read and understand the knowledge represented in RDF. For this reason, the semantics described in the SPHN RDF Schema are primarily defined in a user-accessible tabular format, the SPHN Dataset, before being translated into its RDF representation. However, this translation process was previously manual, time-consuming and labor-intensive.<h4>Result</h4>To automate and streamline the translation from tabular to RDF representation, the SPHN Schema Forge web service was developed. With a few clicks, this tool automatically converts an SPHN-compliant Dataset spreadsheet into an RDF schema. Additionally, it generates SHACL rules for data validation, an HTML visualization of the schema and SPARQL queries for basic data analysis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The SPHN Schema Forge significantly reduces the manual effort and time required for schema generation, enabling researchers to focus on more meaningful tasks such as data interpretation and analysis within the SPHN framework.",Touré V; Unni D; Krauss P; Abdelwahed A; Buchhorn J; Hinderling L; Geiger TR; Österle S,"Personalized Health Informatics, SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Basel, 4051, Switzerland. vasundra.toure@sib.swiss.",Journal of biomedical semantics,2025-05-08,10.1186/s13326-025-00330-9,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Conversion; Semantics; Rdf; Semantic Web; Schema; Healthcare; Web Service; Spreadsheet; Fair
40334220,AD-AutoGPT: An autonomous GPT for Alzheimer's disease infodemiology.,"In this pioneering study, inspired by AutoGPT, the state-of-the-art open-source application based on the GPT-4 large language model, we develop a novel tool called AD-AutoGPT, which can conduct data collection, processing, and analysis about complex health narratives of Alzheimer's Disease in an autonomous manner via users' textual prompts. We collated comprehensive data from a variety of news sources, including the Alzheimer's Association, BBC, Mayo Clinic, and the National Institute on Aging since June 2022, leading to the autonomous execution of robust trend analyses, intertopic distance map visualization, and identification of salient terms pertinent to Alzheimer's Disease. This approach has yielded not only a quantifiable metric of relevant discourse but also valuable insights into public focus on Alzheimer's Disease. This application of AD-AutoGPT in public health signifies the transformative potential of AI in facilitating a data-rich understanding of complex health narratives like Alzheimer's Disease in an autonomous manner, setting the groundwork for future AI-driven investigations in global health landscapes.

40324171,Characterization and Evaluation of Department of Veterans Affairs Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities-Accredited Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Programs: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Program Evaluation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Veterans are more likely to experience chronic pain than civilians, with significant negative impacts on long-term health outcomes. Evidence for the effectiveness of prescription opioids for chronic pain management is limited, and chronic use of opioids is associated with an increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing, cardiovascular complications, and bowel dysfunction, as well as opioid misuse and overdose. Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense guidelines are prioritizing low-risk, evidence-based interdisciplinary pain management strategies while optimizing pain-related outcomes (PRO) for veterans. Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF)-Accredited VA Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Programs (IPRPs) have shared characteristics, while maintaining their unique characteristics as individual pain management programs. Though little is known about the characteristics of VA's IPRPs (eg, staffing, services, and patients served), implementation, and sustainability of these mandated programs.<h4>Objective</h4>The goals of our operational partner-driven evaluation are to (1) characterize IPRPs across multiple program factors, including but not limited to, service delivery methods, team composition, program characteristics, services and modalities offered, and patients served; (2) triangulate data to inform data visualization that characterizes and illustrates the IPRPs individually and collectively as a system of care; and (3) identify patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and metrics to measure program effectiveness and determine overlap across IPRPs.<h4>Methods</h4>This partnered-driven program evaluation will use a sequential mixed methods prospective design, including interviews and surveys. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, and Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) strategies will be used to contextualize qualitative data. Rapid content analysis will be used to iteratively analyze qualitative data, while descriptive statistics will be used to analyze quantitative data. Datasets will be triangulated to support data visualization for partners to inform clinical and operational decision support.<h4>Results</h4>As of April 2025, All IPRP sites are engaged, and survey and interview data have been collected and prepared for analysis. The results and deliverables will inform VA CARF-accredited IPRP characterization, evaluation, and implementation as a learning health system.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of this evaluation will characterize CARF-accredited IPRPs and identify determinants affecting the implementation of this complex intervention, made up of multiple evidence-based practices. Partner-driven data will inform the state of implementation at each site, and quantitative measures will provide options for collecting standardized outcome measures for continued program evaluation. This operational partner-driven evaluation will inform future efforts for quality improvement to improve veterans' pain management outcomes. This protocol informs the use of a mixed methods approach to evaluate a multimodal intervention (ie, IPRP), made up of multiple evidence-based practices to treat a complex comorbid condition. Future work may include data management infrastructure development and cost evaluations to inform clinical and operational decision-making.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/72091.",Haun JN; Fowler CA; French DD; McHugh MC; Heuer JN; Ballistrea LM; Benzinger RC; Klanchar SA; Sandbrink F; Murphy JL,"Research and Development Service, James A.

40340607,Therapeutic Potential of Indole Derivatives: Analytical Perspectives on Their Role in Drug Discovery.,"Indole was first identified around 1869, this being an indole ring system which is a fused benzene and pyrrole ring system. Research findings illustrate that indole derivatives have gained acceptance as therapeutic agents because they contain structural versatility and access different biological targets. Scientific research has established their strong pharmaceutical properties, especially for oncology medicines because they control essential cellular processes while interrupting defective enzymatic activities of topoisomerases, kinases, and histone deacetylases. Research proves that indole-based compounds display broad antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic effects in addition to their cancer-fighting properties. The indole nucleus creates targeted interactions with central nervous system receptors and enzymes for visualization in neurological therapeutic delivery. Research indicates that indole derivatives provide benefits for managing anti-inflammatory responses while lowering blood pressure and diabetes markers although benefiting cardiovascular health through their ability to affect specific disease pathways. The ongoing development of structural optimization methods with synthetic improvements leads to indole compounds which surpass present treatments according to clinical trials. Structural modifications to the indole core system have been explored in recent studies to improve its pharmacological versatility. Research from 2020 to 2024, featuring indole derivatives with their potency, mechanism of action, and strategies to overcome resistance, is highlighted, with a focus on different diseases.

40232895,"Efficient, Robust, and Accurate CNN Predictor for Neuronal Activation in Directional Deep Brain Stimulation.","The programming of clinical deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems involves numerous combinations of stimulation parameters, such as stimulus amplitude, pulse width, and frequency. As more complex electrode designs, such as directional electrodes, are introduced, the traditional trial-and-error approach to manual DBS programming becomes increasingly impractical. Visualization of the volume of tissue activated (VTA) can assist in selecting stimulation parameters by showing the direct effects of DBS on neural tissue. However, the standard method for VTA calculation, which involves modeling biological nerve fibers, is highly time-consuming and limits clinical applicability. In this study, we used finite element models (FEM) of implanted DBS systems to compute electric fields and obtained a large dataset of axonal responses under electrical stimulation using multicompartment cable models. We then trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to replace the cable models. The CNN model's performance in calculating VTA was evaluated across various electrode configurations and stimulation parameters, and compared with existing activation function (AF) methods. The CNN model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.032V in predicting nerve fiber activation thresholds, demonstrating greater stability and accuracy in VTA prediction compared to the AF method. Additionally, the CNN reduced computation time by five orders of magnitude compared to standard axonal modeling methods. We demonstrate that the CNN-based neural fiber predictor can quickly, accurately, and robustly predict neural activation responses to DBS, thereby improving the efficiency of DBS programming.",Wang S; Ma R; Yuan Q; Li H; Jiang C,,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2025-05-07,10.1109/tnsre.2025.3561122,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

40341783,Self-supervised learning framework for efficient classification of endoscopic images using pretext tasks.,"Identifying anatomical landmarks in endoscopic video frames is essential for the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. However, this task remains challenging due to variability in visual characteristics across different regions and the limited availability of annotated data. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that integrates three complementary pretext task, colorization, jigsaw puzzle solving, and patch prediction, to enhance feature learning from unlabeled endoscopic images. By leveraging these tasks, our model extracts rich, meaningful representations, improving the downstream classification of Z-line, esophageal, and antrum/pylorus regions. To further enhance feature extraction and model interpretability, we incorporate attention mechanisms, transformer-based architectures, and Grad-CAM visualization. The integration of attention layers and transformers strengthens the model's ability to learn discriminative and generalizable features, while Grad-CAM improves explainability by highlighting critical decision-making regions. These enhancements make our approach more suitable for clinical deployment, ensuring both high accuracy and interpretability. We evaluate our proposed framework on a comprehensive dataset, demonstrating substantial improvements in classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to conventional models trained without SSL. Specifically, our combined model achieves a classification accuracy of 98%, with high precision and recall across all classes, as reflected in ROC curves and confusion matrices. These results underscore the effectiveness of pretext-task-based SSL, attention mechanism, and transformers for anatomical landmark identification in endoscopic video frames. Our work introduces a scalable and interpretable methodology for improving endoscopic image classification, reducing reliance on large annotated datasets while enhancing model performance in real-world clinical applications. Future research will explore validation on diverse datasets, real-time diagnostic integration, and scalability to further advance medical image analysis using SSL.",Nezhad SA; Tajeddin G; Khatibi T; Sohrabi M,"School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University (TMU), Tehran, Iran.",PloS one,2025-05-08,10.1371/journal.pone.0322028,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40325958,Significance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography in the initial staging of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study was aimed at evaluating the significance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) in the staging and differentiation of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed clinical and imaging data of 21 women and 21 men with MPeM who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT, and reviewed and analyzed 18F-FDG PET/CT characteristics of the patients. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG = MTV × SUVmean) were determined for peritoneal lesions at the highest glycolysis point. Two experienced readers assessed tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging and peritoneal cancer index according to Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International diagnostic requirements.<h4>Results</h4>The SUVmax and MTV values were significantly lower for the epithelial cases than for the nonepithelioid cases, with the difference being significant (P < 0.05). The mean TLG value was significantly lower for the epithelial cases than for the nonepithelioid cases; however, the difference was NS (P > 0.05). Exploratory laparotomy was performed in 18 patients, the 18F-FDG PET/CT diagnostic accuracy for the T stage was 72.2%, and the TNM stage diagnostic accuracy was 94.4%. However, lymph node metastasis was more common in the biphasic type group, and metastasis was more often seen in the sarcomatoid type group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using a previously suggested novel approach for TNM staging in 18F-FDG PET/CT assessment of MPeM may improve the accuracy of staging; however, SUVmax values showed slight variations depending on the pathology type. 18F-FDG PET/CT can improve the accuracy of TNM staging, and SUVmax values vary slightly depending on the pathology type. Furthermore, 18F-FDG PET/CT can afford simultaneous visualization of lesions throughout the body, which can help develop a treatment strategy.",Zhang H; Pang L; Hou J; Li B; Zhang Y,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital (Xiamen), Fudan University, Fujian, China.",Nuclear medicine communications,2025-05-06,10.1097/mnm.0000000000001990,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Peritoneal Cancer Index; Standardized Uptake Values; Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma
40323486,Impact of laser enucleation equipment on irrigant flow rate: an in vitro study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Fluid irrigation is critical for adequate visualization during transurethral endoscopic surgery. There is a paucity of data comparing irrigation by resectoscope, working tools, or fluid system. This study aims to measure flow rate through four different resectoscopes with varying working channel configurations and irrigation systems to compare different configurations of clinical equipment used during laser endoscopic enucleation of the prostate (LEEP).<h4>Materials/methods</h4>We measured irrigation flow rates through four different sized resectoscopes with three different working channel configurations using five different irrigation systems in a benchtop model. Irrigation was run through each equipment configuration for 30 s in duplicate, and flow rate was calculated.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred measurements were performed in 50 different equipment configurations. From fastest to slowest, resectoscope flow rates were as follows: 28Fr Storz, 26Fr Storz, 26Fr Wolf, and 24.5Fr Wolf (p < 0.0001) with no statistically significant difference seen among the three working channel configurations. From fastest to slowest, irrigation system flow rates were as follows: 150 cm Y-tubing, 150 cm Level-1, 100 cm Y-tubing, 100 cm Level-1, and Thermedx 60 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). Comparing irrigation systems, within group standard deviations were low except in the 100 cm and 150 cm Level-1 systems (SD 53.7 and 56.6mL/min respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Resectoscope irrigation followed the principles of fluid dynamics, with larger caliber scopes providing greater flow independently of working equipment selections. Despite the inconsistencies seen with the Level-1, higher pressure irrigation resulted in faster flow across all equipment configurations. Future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to understand if these findings are reproducible and clinically impactful.",Morgan KN; Terry RS; Holloway AR; Krishingner GA; George KA; Massari M; Canales BK; Bird VG; DiBianco JM,"Florida Urology Partners, 16513 US-301, Wimauma, Tampa, FL, 33598, USA.

40334129,Treatment Acceptability and Satisfaction With Cough Skill Training in Parkinson's Disease: A Mixed-Methods Study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Despite evidence to suggest that rehabilitation can improve airway protection in people with Parkinson's disease (pwPD), rehabilitative therapies are underutilized. One newer treatment approach with growing evidence to support its efficacy is cough skill training (CST). To improve utilization of rehabilitations such as CST, it is important to understand patient treatment experience. Therefore, the aim of this study was to define treatment acceptability and satisfaction of CST in pwPD.<h4>Method</h4>Thirteen pwPD were consecutively recruited from a trial during which participants completed two in-person sessions of CST via spirometry over 2 weeks. A mixed-methods approach was used, whereby quantitative data (obtained from questionnaires) and qualitative data (obtained from semistructured interviews) were integrated to provide a holistic understanding of patient experience. Data collection and thematic analyses (of qualitative data) were guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety framework.<h4>Results</h4>While treatment demonstrated adequate acceptability with a System Usability Scale median score of 70/100 (scores ≥ 70 indicate acceptability), integrative examination of patient experience revealed several themes that highlight barriers and facilitators to treatment acceptability-as they relate to CST tools (visualization, lip seal, and measurement accuracy) and tasks (practice targets, feedback, practice amount, and future training). Most (61.5%) participants were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with CST. Four themes emerged related to satisfaction: treatment <i>relevance</i>, patient <i>awareness and control</i> over their disease, <i>skill acquisition</i>, and <i>skill transference</i> to real-life choking events<i>.</i><h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, patient responses indicated that small, personalized adaptations to equipment, training targets, and feedback may enhance their experiences, while education and personalized goal setting may enhance treatment relevance and perceived benefit. Patient perspectives and needs can inform the refinement of person-centered clinical implementation of CST and improve treatment uptake.<h4>Supplemental material</h4>https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.28887167.",Sevitz JS; Rogus-Pulia N; Malandraki GA; Troche MS,"Laboratory for the Study of Upper Airway Dysfunction, Department of Biobehavioral Sciences, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, NY.","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",2025-05-07,10.1044/2025_jslhr-24-00768,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40336124,"Maladaptive personality traits (DSM-5 AMPD, Criterion B) and depression among medical students in Egypt: a multicentric cross-sectional study.","<h4>Background</h4>The relationship between maladaptive personality traits and other mental disorders, such as depression, has been underexplored, especially in medical students. Moreover, the prevalence of depression among medical students is greater than that among the general population, increasing their susceptibility to associated psychopathologies. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the relationship between depression and maladaptive personality trait domains on the basis of Criterion B of the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (DSM-5 AMPD) among medical students while also highlighting relevant sociodemographic factors.<h4>Methodology</h4>A cross-sectional study was conducted from May to September 2024, with participants surveyed through an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included three sections: sociodemographic characteristics, assessment of depression via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and maladaptive personality traits via the Personality Inventory for DSM-5-Brief Form (PID-5-BF). Statistical analysis was conducted in R via various packages for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, employing descriptive statistics, regression models, correlation analysis, and reliability tests.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 2,203 students participated in this study, with a marginal female dominance of 1,230 (55.8%). The mean (SD) overall maladaptive trait score was 1.11 (0.54), and that for the PHQ-9 was 11.7 (6.0). Statistical analysis revealed that higher depression scores were more strongly associated with females than with males, whereas maladaptive trait scores revealed no significant sex differences. The linear regression model for maladaptive trait domains revealed a significant association between total PHQ-9 scores and overall personality trait scores (B = 0.05 [0.05, 0.06]; β = 0.61 [0.58, 0.64]; p < 0.001). Similarly, another regression model confirmed this association, with overall personality trait scores being statistically significant (B = 7.0 [6.6, 7.3]; β = 0.62 [0.59, 0.65]; p < 0.001)"".<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings revealed a significant correlation between maladaptive personality traits and depression in medical students. Moreover, the strong correlation between depression and negative affect suggests that negative affect may be closely linked to depressive symptoms. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between maladaptive trait domains and depression and how that relationship affects vulnerable groups such as medical students.",Elalfy K; Farrag A; Suleiman A; Darwish NE; Elqady Y; Esmail M; Abdelwahed A; Wagih H; ; Gallab M,"Faculty of Medicine, Kafrelsheikh University, Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt. khaledelalfy700@gmail.com.",BMC psychology,2025-05-07,10.1186/s40359-025-02784-z,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Depression; Egypt; Medical Students; Phq-9; Personality Pathology; Maladaptive Personality Traits; Pid-5-bf; Dsm-5 Ampd

Traditional imaging techniques like MRI are limited by their two-dimensional (2D) nature, prompting the use of three-dimensional (3D) modeling for enhanced visualization.<h4>Methods</h4>This systematic review, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, analysed 17 studies using 3D models for surgical planning, education, and patient engagement in managing complex FIA. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized studies and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, revealing that all included studies had at least a moderate risk of bias.<h4>Results</h4>Three-dimensional models improved anatomical visualization compared to 2D MRI, potentially enhancing surgical planning accuracy and reducing recurrence rates. They also offered educational benefits for surgeons and patients. However, the evidence is limited by methodological weaknesses such as small sample sizes and subjective outcome measures.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Three-dimensional modelling technology shows promise in improving surgical precision and patient outcomes for complex FIA, but further high-quality research is needed to validate its clinical utility due to methodological weaknesses in current studies.",Ruscoe Z; Lin C; Kokelaar R; Yeung J; Shannon R,"Western Health, Melbourne, Australia.",ANZ journal of surgery,2025-05-05,10.1111/ans.70144,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Patient education; Surgical Planning; Surgical Education; Three‐dimensional Modelling; Fistula‐in‐ano

39528299,Ultra-High-Resolution Photon-Counting-Detector CT with a Dedicated Denoising Convolutional Neural Network for Enhanced Temporal Bone Imaging.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT improves image resolution but increases noise, necessitating the use of smoother reconstruction kernels that reduce resolution below the 0.125-mm maximum spatial resolution. A denoising convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to reduce noise in images reconstructed with the available sharpest reconstruction kernel while preserving resolution for enhanced temporal bone visualization to address this issue.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>With institutional review board approval, the CNN was trained on 6 patient cases of clinical temporal bone imaging (1885 images) and tested on 20 independent cases using a dual-source PCD-CT (NAEOTOM Alpha). Images were reconstructed using quantum iterative reconstruction at strength 3 (QIR3) with both a clinical routine kernel (Hr84) and the sharpest available head kernel (Hr96). The CNN was applied to images reconstructed with Hr96 and QIR1 kernel. For each case, three series of images (Hr84-QIR3, Hr96-QIR3, and Hr96-CNN) were randomized for review by 2 neuroradiologists assessing the overall quality and delineating the modiolus, stapes footplate, and incudomallear joint.<h4>Results</h4>The CNN reduced noise by 80% compared with Hr96-QIR3 and by 50% relative to Hr84-QIR3, while maintaining high resolution. Compared with the conventional method at the same kernel (Hr96-QIR3), Hr96-CNN significantly decreased image noise (from 204.63 to 47.35 HU) and improved its structural similarity index (from 0.72 to 0.99). Hr96-CNN images ranked higher than Hr84-QIR3 and Hr96-QIR3 in overall quality (<i>P</i> < .001). Readers preferred Hr96-CNN for all 3 structures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed CNN significantly reduced image noise in UHR PCD-CT, enabling the use of the sharpest kernel.

In this paper, we provide a single cell in vitro analysis for the effect of the particles, which can enter into blood stream, on red blood cells (RBCs). The RBCs under experiment are incubated with [Formula: see text] particle as the most abundant air pollutants in big cities. The self-referencing digital holographic microscopy (DHM) in Gates' arrangement as a vibration-immune methodology is considered here for live visualization and quantitative analysis of the cells. DHM is a label-free and noninvasive method, therefore, suitable for quantitative and morphometric imaging of biological specimens in arbitrary time scales and at video rates.

40334069,Exploring the Application Potential of α-Synuclein Molecular Probes in Early Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease: Focus on Imaging Methods.,"This review aims to explore the potential application of α-synuclein (α-syn) molecular probes in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly through systematic evaluation using medical imaging methods. In recent years, The abnormal aggregation of α-syn within the central nervous system is now recognized as a central driver of PD pathophysiology, solidifying its role as a critical diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Early diagnosis of PD is critical for enabling precision therapeutic interventions and mitigating neurodegenerative progression, thereby enhancing long-term functional outcomes and the quality of life. However, challenges remain in clinical practice, particularly concerning the late timing of diagnosis and the lack of specific biomarkers. By analyzing the existing literature, we will assess the effectiveness of different imaging techniques combined with α-syn probes and discuss their advantages and limitations in clinical applications. These imaging methods can provide visualization of early pathological changes, helping to improve the recognition rate of PD. Finally, we emphasize the importance of future research to explore new molecular probes and imaging technologies that can improve early diagnosis rates and treatment outcomes for PD.",Sun Q; Wu M; Xie R; Lai L; Chen Q; Guan J,"Department of Medical Imaging, Longgang District Central Hospital of Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518116, China.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2025-05-07,10.1021/acschemneuro.5c00008,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Molecular probes; Medical imaging; Biomarker; α-synuclein; Parkinson’s Disease
40340491,Assessing the learning curve for percutaneous ultrasound-guided release in carpal tunnel syndrome.,"Percutaneous ultrasound-guided release of carpal tunnel syndrome is an effective and safe technique; however, it requires familiarity with ultrasound visualization of the anatomical structures involved. This study aimed to determine the learning curve for percutaneous ultrasound-guided release of the carpal tunnel. We conducted a prospective, observational, analytical cohort study on patients treated for carpal tunnel syndrome using the percutaneous ultrasound-guided technique. We assessed the learning curve using complication rates, duration of procedure and conversion rate to open surgery. Eighty patients with a mean age of 58 years were included. The surgical time gradually decreased, stabilizing after the first 30 procedures. There were no intraoperative complications and no cases requiring conversion to open surgery. Based on our experience, the learning curve for percutaneous ultrasound-guided release of carpal tunnel syndrome is approximately 30 procedures. Clinical outcomes were not affected by the learning curve.<b>Level of evidence:</b> II.",Castro-Menéndez M; Balvís-Balvís P; Denisiuk M; Vázquez-Cancela O,"Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology.

40322890,&lt;i&gt;In Silico&lt;/i&gt; Design and Evaluation of Novel Peptide-Based PET Probe for Noninvasive Imaging of HER2 Expression in Breast Cancer.,"The overexpression of HER2 has been strongly correlated with the pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer. Developing HER2-targeted PET tracers for noninvasive assessment of HER2 expression holds substantial clinical significance for screening patients suitable for HER2-targeted therapy, evaluating treatment efforts, and optimizing treatment. In this study, we employed computational simulation methods to develop peptide WC8 derived from trastuzumab, and designed HER2 targeting radiotracers [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-WC8 for detecting the HER2 expression. The radiotracer demonstrated nanomolar affinity, high specificity, and favorable pharmacokinetics. PET imaging revealed that [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-WC8 exhibited significant and specific uptake in HER2-positive breast cancer tissues, facilitating the rapid and accurate identification of HER2 expression. Notably, this radiotracer was successfully utilized to achieve direct visualization of tumor response to pyrotinib, a HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These findings suggest that the peptide-based radiotracer [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-WC8 represents a promising tool for accurately monitoring of HER2 expression after treatment with HER2-targeting drugs.",Guo X; Xu C; Zhu X; Wang X; Hao Y; Wang X; Yao Y; Fang J; Wang K,"NHC Key Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Nuclear Medicine, Jiangsu Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214063, China.",Journal of medicinal chemistry,2025-05-05,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5c00760,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40111779,MRI Coregistered Rodent Histotripsy Array for Orthotopic Liver Models.,"Histotripsy has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for liver tumors, recently gaining food and drug administration (FDA) approval for clinical use in October 2023. Preclinical in vivo histotripsy experiments primarily utilize subcutaneous ectopic murine tumor models, which fail to accurately replicate the complex immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of liver tumors. In order to address this gap, we present the design, development, and in vivo demonstration of a miniature, electronically steerable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided histotripsy array tailored for orthotopic murine liver tumor models. This novel system integrates an 89-element phased array within a 7.0-T small animal MRI scanner, enabling precise targeting through enhanced soft tissue contrast and 3-D visualization. The targeting accuracy of the array was validated in tissue-mimicking red blood cell (RBC) phantoms, exhibiting targeting precision of $0.24~\pm ~0.1$ mm. Subsequent in vivo experiments in naïve mice demonstrated successful liver ablations, confirmed by gross morphology and histological analysis. However, the presence of grating lobes led to undesired collateral damage, highlighted by lung hemorrhages, necessitating future adjustments in the array's design. This study illustrates the foundational steps necessary for translating histotripsy experiments from subcutaneous to orthotopic models.",Hubbard R; Choi D; Worlikar T; Scheven U; Kim H; Sukovich JR; Hall TL; Xu Z,,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2025-05-07,10.1109/tuffc.2025.3553083,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40335658,Radiological evaluation and clinical implications of deep learning- and MRI-based synthetic CT for the assessment of cervical spine injuries.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Efficient evaluation of soft tissues and bony structures following cervical spine trauma is critical. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic validity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based synthetic CT (sCT) compared with conventional computed tomography (CT) for cervical spine injuries.<h4>Methods</h4>In a prospective, multicenter study, patients with cervical spine injuries underwent CT and MRI within 48 h after injury. A panel of five clinicians independently reviewed the images for diagnostic accuracy, lesion characterization (AO Spine classification), and soft tissue trauma. Fracture visibility, anterior (AVH) and posterior wall height (PVH), vertebral body angle (VBA), segmental kyphosis (SK), with corresponding interobserver reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)) and intermodal differences (Fleiss' Kappa), were recorded. The accuracy of estimating Hounsfield unit (HU) values and mean cortical surface distances were measured.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-seven patients (44 cervical spine fractures) were enrolled. sCT demonstrated a sensitivity of 97.3% for visualizing fractures. Intermodal agreement regarding injury classification indicated almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.922; p < 0.001). Inter-reader ICCs were good to excellent (CT vs. sCT): AVH (0.88, 0.87); PVH (0.87, 0.88); VBA (0.78, 0.76); SK (0.77, 0.93). Intermodal agreement showed a mean absolute difference of 0.3 mm (AVH), 0.3 mm (PVH), 1.15° (VBA) and 0.51° (SK), respectively. MRI visualized additional soft tissue trauma in 56.8% of patients. Voxelwise comparisons of sCT showed good to excellent agreement with CT in terms of HUs (mean absolute error of 20 (SD ± 62)) and a mean absolute cortical surface distance of 0.45 mm (SD ± 0.13).<h4>Conclusion</h4>sCT is a promising, radiation-free imaging technique for diagnosing cervical spine injuries with similar accuracy to CT.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Assessing the accuracy of MRI-based synthetic CT (sCT) for fracture visualization and classification in comparison to the gold standard of CT for cervical spine injuries. Findings sCT demonstrated a 97.3% sensitivity in detecting fractures and exhibited near-perfect intermodal agreement in classifying injuries according to the AO Spine classification system.

40331901,A CRISPR/Cas12a-coupled multiplexed amplification system for ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-155.,"miRNA plays an important role in gene regulation and can be an effective biomarker for disease diagnosis. Herein, a new miRNA detection platform based on the CRISPR/Cas12a-coupled multiplexed amplification system is developed. In this strategy, miRNA-155 acts as an intermediary to trigger the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). Due to the introduction of endonuclide recognition sites in the amplification template, the resulting double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) can in turn initiate a strand replacement reaction (SDA), generating a great deal of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The ssDNA can directly unlock the trans-cleavage activity of CRSIPR/Cas12a, and the process is independent of PAM sites. Subsequently, the activated Cas12a trans-cleaves nearby signaling molecules, outputting a fluorescence/visualization signal. This method achieves miRNA detection as low as 68.69 fM, with a linear range of 200 fM to 1 nM, and shows good selectivity and repeatability. Meanwhile, the target of 10 pM can be distinguished by the naked eye. Moreover, the proposed method can achieve miRNA-155 detection in complicated cell extracts. The excellent detection sensitivity is mainly due to the integration of two amplification techniques, while the CRISPR/Cas12a system enables fast and accurate visual detection. More importantly, the actual detection results are consistent with standard methods (RT-qPCR), indicating that the CRISPR/Cas12a-coupled multiplexed amplification system is reliable and has potential clinical application value.",Ai Z; Wang W; Li X; Wang X; Chen J; Wu J; Zhou S,"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou 646000, P.

40336276,HD-ALP fluorescent probe: a high-sensitivity tool for alkaline phosphatase imaging and preclinical diagnosis in three ovarian cancer models.,"Ovarian cancer (OC) remains a prevalent gynecological malignancy, posing significant threats to women's health globally. Emerging evidence underscores the critical involvement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in OC pathogenesis, prompting the development of targeted diagnostic tools. Herein, we report the successful application of a novel fluorescent probe, HD-ALP, for fluorescence imaging of ALP in ovarian cancer cells and preclinical models. After being triggered by ALP, HD-ALP responded in the fluorescence signal reporting manner. More importantly, the fluorescence signal showed a reliable linear correlation with ALP levels in the range of 0-10 000 U L<sup>-1</sup>. The HD-ALP probe demonstrated high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability under necessary biological conditions. The intracellular imaging results indicated that HD-ALP enabled the visualization of ALP levels within ovarian cancer cells. The <i>in vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that HD-ALP could accurately differentiate between healthy and cancerous models (subcutaneous transplantation tumor model of ovarian cancer, orthotopic ovarian cancer model, and primary ovarian cancer model). Notably, in cellular and <i>in vivo</i> imaging, HD-ALP could effectively reflect the decrease in the fluorescence signal after the addition of ALP inhibitors. By integrating ALP detection, which utilizes the HD-ALP fluorescence mode, with traditional methods like immunohistochemistry staining and serum biomarker detection, potential strategies for more accurate diagnosis of OC may be developed for preclinical trials in the future. According to the research, this is also one of the few developments of fluorescence detection tools for measuring ALP levels in ovarian cancer models.",Shi Y; Dong R; Huang H; Wang G; Gao J; Wang K; Zhang T,"Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, Affiliated Women's Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi 214002, China. 9862022078@jiangnan.edu.cn.",Journal of materials chemistry.

40340838,Dorsolateral approach to hip and pelvis ultrasound in dogs.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To provide a video tutorial demonstrating ultrasound of the canine hip and pelvis for identifying hip luxation and other pelvic injury.<h4>Animals</h4>Dogs presenting with acute pelvic limb lameness referable to the hip region.<h4>Methods</h4>The hip and abaxial portions of the pelvis are visualized in short-axis orientation by placement of a linear (5- to 14-MHz) or microconvex (4- to 10-MHz) ultrasound probe on the dorsolateral aspect of the pelvis in medial-lateral orientation. Clipping the haircoat and applying ultrasound gel allows for best visualization, though application of 70% isopropyl alcohol without clipping allows acceptable imaging of osseous structures in most dogs. Starting at the cranial extent of the iliac wing, the pelvis is imaged from cranial to caudal. Osseous structures are identified by their contours and acoustic shadowing. The normal hip joint is recognized by articulation of the rounded femoral head with the triangularly shaped contour of the acetabulum.<h4>Results</h4>Hip luxation is identified by displacement of the femoral head cranially or caudally to the acetabulum with either dorsal positioning of the femoral head or ventral positioning of the greater trochanter relative to adjacent pelvic bones. Fractures are detected through the presence of steplike defects in the osseous contours.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Ultrasound of the pelvis and hip region in dogs allows for timely identification of hip luxation or pelvic fractures without sedation. This technique can be utilized in emergency, ambulatory, or remote care settings to help categorize injury for facilitating client discussions regarding additional imaging recommendations, treatment recommendations, and associated medical care costs.",Todd-Donato AB; Krotscheck U,,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,2025-05-09,10.2460/javma.25.03.0169,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Ultrasonography; Hip; Pelvis; Canine; Musculoskeletal
40328243,Contrast Agent-Specific Parameter Optimization for T1-Weighted Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo Imaging: Use Cases for Gadoterate Meglumine and Gadobutrol at 1.5T and 3.0T.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study is to derive a contrast agent-specific theoretical framework to optimize acquisition parameters for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the physiochemical properties of gadolinium-based contrast agents, focusing on fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences. The goal is to enhance the lesion-to-background contrast for improved diagnostic sensitivity in clinical applications.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Signal equations for fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences were derived for nonenhancing and enhancing tissues using gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol, characterized by distinct longitudinal (r1) and transverse (r2/r*2) relaxivities. Simulations were conducted at 2 field strengths, 1.5T and 3.0T, and various scenarios were considered, including hypothetical lesions with T1 ratios ranging from 1.1 to 1.8. The signal behavior was analyzed across a range of initial conditions, including different spin densities and field-strength dependent variations in tissue relaxation times. The optimal flip angle and repetition time combinations were determined to maximize contrast. In vivo validation was performed on 2 patients undergoing contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain, using the proposed acquisition parameters.<h4>Results</h4>The modeling and simulations revealed that the flip angle that maximizes signal intensity for a contrast-enhancing lesion (Ernst angle) differs from the flip angle that maximizes T1-dependent contrast between lesion and healthy tissue in unenhanced MRI (Pelc angle) and also differs from the flip angle that maximizes the same in contrast-enhanced MRI. The theoretical simulations indicated possible contrast gains of 24%-28% using optimized parameters. The in vivo acquisitions demonstrated contrast gains of 19%-44% for a diffuse enhancing lesion and 91% for a weakly enhancing focal lesion, when comparing the optimized acquisition parameters to manufacturer's default settings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Adjusted repetition time and flip angle values, derived using the proposed framework, improved the image contrast between healthy and diseased tissues, enhancing the visualization of abnormalities. This approach can be used to optimize routine clinical MRI protocols and balance scan time with contrast enhancement. This may translate to more precise lesion detection, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis or treatment monitoring in clinical practice.",Gkotsis DE; Bherwani A; Kapsalaki EZ; Bishop CJ; Schwarz AJ,"From the GE HealthCare, Pharmaceutical Diagnostics, London, United Kingdom (D.E.G., A.B., C.J.B., A.J.S.); Radiology Department, Diagnostic Center Euromedica, Athens, Greece (E.Z.K.); and Department of Radiology, University of Thessaly, School of Medicine, Larissa, Greece (E.Z.K.).",Investigative radiology,2025-05-07,10.1097/rli.0000000000001205,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Parameter optimization; Contrast-enhanced Mri; Gadolinium-based Contrast Agents; Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo Imaging
40344358,Implementation of needle-tracking technology for real-time transrectal ultrasound-guided interstitial gynecological HDR brachytherapy: A feasibility study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To investigate the feasibility of adapting a commercial prostate biopsy system for transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided hybrid gynecological (GYN) high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT). Leveraging 3D-TRUS and MR image fusion, the prototype system aims to improve real-time needle placement accuracy.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A second-generation, multi-imaging modality female pelvic phantom was developed to validate the system's feasibility. Software and hardware modifications, including user-accessible calibration modules and a redesigned needle guide for multi-needle insertion, were made to the pre-existing commercial system to enable use for GYN BT applications. An end-to-end feasibility test was performed to acquire 3D-TRUS images, perform contour-based registration with pre-implant MR, and insert six needles to targeted locations under real-time TRUS guidance. A 30° tandem without ovoids was added to mimic a hybrid GYN implant. The most proximal and most distal distances between the planned needle track and the visible portion of each inserted needle were measured. A CT/MR image-based treatment plan with a prescribed dose of 6 Gy was generated for the resulting 3D-TRUS-guided implant (tandem and needles) within the phantom.<h4>Results</h4>The modified phantom improved needle visualization and insertion range by de-gassing the silicone and increasing the window size. The system accuracy for average ± standard deviations from intended needle tracks was 1.31 ± 1.36 mm (proximal) and 2.04 ± 2.05 mm (distal). Post-implant imaging confirmed needle placement and good target coverage. Needle placement was verified on CT/MR images and treatment plan quality was clinically acceptable.<h4>Conclusions</h4>With enhanced needle placement accuracy and integrated clinical workflow, this study demonstrates the feasibility of adapting a commercially available prostate biopsy system for 3D-TRUS-guided hybrid GYN HDR BT.",Bloom LH; Ayala-Peacock D; Venkataraman R; Eckroate B; Sanford R; Chino J; Kim Y; Raffi J; Craciunescu O,"Department of Radiation Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2025-05-08,10.1002/acm2.70100,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Hybrid; Interstitial; Brachytherapy; ultrasound; Image Guidance; Gyn
40326602,Nanobody-Based PET Imaging of CD47 Expression in Thyroid Carcinoma.,"Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the endocrine system. A significant correlation has been established between elevated CD47 expression and the progression of thyroid carcinoma. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic potential of immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) utilizing CD47-targeting nanobodies in thyroid cancer tumor models. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to evaluate CD47 expression in patients with thyroid cancer, as well as in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) xenograft tumor (OCUT-2C) and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) xenograft tumors (TPC-1 and BCPAP). Two nanobodies, C2 and its albumin-binding derivative (ABDC2), specifically targeting CD47 were labeled with <sup>68</sup>Ga. The tracers were evaluated using immunoPET imaging in models of thyroid cancer. IHC revealed that CD47 was highly expressed in 34.69% of the tumor tissues from patients with thyroid cancer. Additionally, high levels of CD47 expression were observed in OCUT-2C, TPC-1, and BCPAP tumor tissues. Micro-PET imaging using [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-C2 and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-ABDC2 demonstrated clear visualization of OCUT-2C tumors. Notably, the tumor uptake of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-ABDC2 was significantly higher than that of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-C2 at each imaging time point. Additionally, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-ABDC2 exhibited specific uptake in the TPC-1 and BCPAP models. This study confirmed that [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-NOTA-ABDC2 as a innovative PET imaging radiotracer targeting CD47 presented specific and higher tumor uptake to accurately identify CD47 expression and diagnose thyroid cancer. The clinical application of these imaging strategies may aid in selecting patients for CD47-targeted therapies and evaluating their subsequent responses.",Wang W; Zhang J; Li Z; Zhang R; Yan H; Wang X; Chen P; Li J; Zhao Y,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, Guangdong, China.",Molecular pharmaceutics,2025-05-06,10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5c00284,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Thyroid cancer; Cd47; Nanobody; Immunopet
40323608,Endometriosis: A Review.,"<h4>Importance</h4>Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease defined by endometrial-like tissue (lesions) outside the uterine lining. It affects up to 10% of women worldwide, and 9 million women in the US, during reproductive years.<h4>Observations</h4>Endometriosis has varying clinical presentations; however, 90% of people with endometriosis report pelvic pain, including dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, and 26% report infertility. Risk factors for endometriosis include younger age at menarche, shorter menstrual cycle length, lower body mass index, nulliparity, and congenital obstructive müllerian anomalies such as obstructed hemivagina. Although definitive diagnosis requires surgical visualization of lesions, a suspected clinical diagnosis can be made based on symptoms, supported by physical examination findings and imaging with transvaginal ultrasound and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging; normal physical examination and imaging do not exclude the diagnosis. The diagnosis is often delayed, averaging 5 to 12 years after onset of symptoms, with most women consulting 3 or more clinicians prior to diagnosis. Hormonal medications, such as combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only options, are first-line treatment and should be offered to symptomatic premenopausal women who do not currently desire pregnancy. In a network meta-analysis (n = 1680, 15 clinical trials), hormonal treatments including combined oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists led to clinically significant pain reduction compared with placebo, with mean differences ranging between 13.15 and 17.6 points (0-100 visual analog scale) with little difference in effectiveness among options. However, 11% to 19% of individuals with endometriosis have no pain reduction with hormonal medications and 25% to 34% experience recurrent pelvic pain within 12 months of discontinuing hormonal treatment. Surgical removal of lesions, usually with laparoscopy, should be considered if first-line hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. Second-line hormone therapies include GnRH agonists and antagonists, and third-line treatments include aromatase inhibitors. Hysterectomy with surgical removal of lesions may be considered when initial treatments are ineffective. However, approximately 25% of patients who undergo hysterectomy for endometriosis experience recurrent pelvic pain and 10% undergo additional surgery, such as lysis of adhesions, to treat pain.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain affecting approximately 10% of reproductive-age women. Hormonal suppression with combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestins is first-line treatment for women who are not seeking immediate pregnancy. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions may be performed if hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated, and hysterectomy may be considered if medical treatments and surgical removal of lesions do not relieve symptoms.",As-Sanie S; Mackenzie SC; Morrison L; Schrepf A; Zondervan KT; Horne AW; Missmer SA,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.",JAMA,2025-05-05,10.1001/jama.2025.2975,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40343815,68Ga-NK224 PET/CT for Non-Invasive Evaluation of PD-L1 Expression and Inter-Tumor Heterogeneity: A Translational Exploratory Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>This study developed 68Ga-NK224, a novel peptide-based radiotracer targeting human PD-L1, to evaluate the feasibility of 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT for assessing PD-L1 expression and tumor heterogeneity in a prospective investigator-initiated trial.<h4>Methods</h4>In preclinical studies, NK224 was labeled with 68Ga. Small-animal PET, biodistribution, and blocking studies were performed using tumor models with varying PD-L1 expression levels to assess the targeting ability and specificity of 68Ga-NK224 in vivo. Serial 68Ga-NK224 PET assessed target occupancy following PD-L1 antibody administration. In the clinical study, 37 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT were prospectively recruited, with PD-L1 expression assessed via immunohistochemistry and analyzed for correlation with 68Ga-NK224 uptake.<h4>Results</h4>Preclinical studies demonstrated that 68Ga-NK224 exhibited high tumor uptake and rapid clearance, producing favorable tumor-to-background contrast. In human CD34+ humanized mice, immunotherapy guided by 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT (once weekly) yielded similar antitumor effects as conventional dosing (three times weekly). Clinically, 68Ga-NK224 PET/CT was well-tolerated, with no adverse events reported. Among the 31 patients who underwent paired 68Ga-NK224 and 18F-FDG PET/CT, tumor uptake of 68Ga-NK224 significantly correlated with PD-L1 expression, whereas no correlation was found with 18F-FDG PET/CT. Additionally, 68Ga-NK224 demonstrated high heterogeneity across intrapatient lesions, with a median SUVmax coefficient of variation of 27.5% (range, 5.7%-53.2%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>68Ga-NK224 provides a straightforward radiolabeling approach with high tumor-to-background contrast, enabling accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression and visualization of heterogeneity across intrapatient lesions. Its ability to dynamically monitor PD-L1 occupancy in tumors offers a novel method for optimizing immunotherapy dosing regimens.",Zhao L; Pang Y; Ding Y; Chen J; Fang J; Yu L; Ruan D; Dai Y; Zhou H; Fu H; Guo W; Sun L; Wu H; Zhong S; Lin Q; Chen H,"First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2025-05-09,10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-25-0160,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40334098,Novel Near Infrared Dyes Targeting Carbonic Anhydrase IX for Fluorescence Imaging Applications.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Fluorescence tumor-targeted imaging is a sensitive technique that may assist surgeons to remove residual cancer tissue during resection. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a tumor-associated cell-surface glycoprotein, upregulated in hypoxic environments, and a suitable biomarker to develop targeted dyes for fluorescence-guided surgery. This study describes design, synthesis, in vitro and in vivo assessment of novel CAIX-targeting fluorescent probes based on the well-known drug acetazolamide, addressing the contribution of both targeting moiety and fluorophore structure on imaging efficacy.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>All the CAIX-targeting heptamethine cyanines synthesized and described in the present work were characterized in terms of their optical properties in different media. The affinity to human serum albumin was evaluated by UV-VIS spectrophotometry. The affinity to the CA catalytic site was determined on a recombinant bovine CAII enzyme (bCAII), with a fluorescent-based assay. Human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, highly expressing CAIX, were used for the in vitro characterization, including cell binding, uptake and competition assays, by flow cytometry. Finally, the in vivo tumor targeting efficacy of a selected group of probes was assessed by Optical Imaging in a mouse subcutaneous tumor from HT-29 cells, characterized by both expression of CAIX and a hypoxic tumor microenvironment.<h4>Results</h4>First, a family of CAIX-targeting probes was prepared by functionalizing a novel glucamine-bearing heptamethine cyanine (Dye1) with a modified acetazolamide moiety, whose acetyl group was replaced with i) aminooctanoic acid C8, ii) phenylalanine, iii) amino-PEG2-acid and iv) the longer linker 4a, or 2 commercially available benzenesulfonamides. From the in vitro screening of this first group of compounds, the C8-AZA targeting moiety was selected due to its highest affinity. Indeed, Dye1-C8-AZA exhibited the lowest KD values for both bCAII (6.1 ± 1.6 nM) and CAIX-expressing HT-29 cells (58 ± 9 nM), even lower than HypoxyFluor-1 (HF-1), a CAIX-targeted dye already reported in the literature. Then, other heptamethine cyanines (Dye2-Dye5, linear or cyclic, with different substituents on the indolenines and different conjugation position of the targeting vector) were functionalized with C8-AZA and fully characterized both in vitro and in vivo, to evaluate the combinatory effect of vector and fluorophore on the performance of the resulting probes. The different chemical features of the cyanines influenced the optical properties, solubility, binding with albumin, biodistribution, and imaging efficacy of the probes, while leaving unaffected the high affinity to the target. When tested in vivo for the visualization of CAIX-expressing HT-29 tumors, all C8-AZA probes showed high and specific tumor accumulation, often superior to HF-1.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Several CAIX-targeting probes were synthesized to test the combinatory effect of different molecular vectors and dyes on the biological properties. All probes containing the C8-AZA targeting moiety displayed higher affinity and specificity to the target, while imaging efficacy in vivo was strongly influenced also by the structure of the labelling dye.

40127300,Improving Methodologies for Cumulative Risk Assessment: A Case Study of Noncarcinogenic Health Risks from Volatile Organic Compounds in Fenceline Communities in Southeastern Pennsylvania.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cumulative risk assessment (CRA) is key to characterizing health risks in fenceline and disadvantaged communities, which face environmental pollution and challenging socioeconomic conditions. Traditional approaches for inclusion of mixtures in CRA are limited and only assess the most sensitive target organ system for each chemical.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed an expanded approach to cumulative risk assessment that considers all known target organ systems associated with a chemical. Specifically, we created a multi-effects toxicity database by <i>a</i>) compiling toxicological and epidemiological data from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's (ATSDR) Toxicological Profiles and the Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) CompTox Chemicals Dashboard; <i>b</i>) developing a tiering system to prioritize identified data for use in developing toxicity values; and <i>c</i>) accounting for uncertainty to create toxicity values for additional target organ systems. We demonstrated differences between the traditional approach and our expanded approach by using state-of-the-art mobile monitoring data from our Southeastern Pennsylvania Hazardous Air Pollutant Monitoring and Assessment Project (SEPA HAP-MAP) to conduct a cumulative risk assessment.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 32 chemicals quantified in SEPA HAP-MAP, 28 were represented in our multi-effects toxicity database, whereas only 16 were included using a traditional approach. In total, we derived toxicity values for 172 chemical-target organ system combinations. Our expanded approach found neurological, renal, respiratory, endocrine, and systemic risks (hazard index >1) in SEPA HAP-MAP fenceline communities, whereas no risks were identified using a traditional approach limited to the most sensitive target organ systems only.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results suggest that traditional approaches to CRA underestimate health risks in fenceline and other highly exposed communities and highlight the need for improved methods to inform health-protective and just risk management decisions. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP14696.",Chiger AA; Gigot C; Robinson ES; Tehrani MW; Claflin M; Fortner E; Stark H; Krechmer J; Canagaratna MR; Herndon S; Yacovitch TI; Koehler K; Rule AM; Burke TA; Fox MA; DeCarlo PF; Nachman KE,"Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.",Environmental health perspectives,2025-05-08,10.1289/ehp14696,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
