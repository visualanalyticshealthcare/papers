41569629,Interactive Digital Visualization Counseling for Lifestyle Change in Patients at Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death. Primary prevention relies heavily on health risk assessments and lifestyle changes, which can reduce long-term risk and mortality. Digital health offers an accessible and cost-effective approach to support prevention, enabling data sharing and visualization of key indicators such as blood pressure and glucose fluctuations. These visual insights may help patients better understand the effects of lifestyle changes and enhance communication with health care providers.<h4>Objective</h4>This research aims to evaluate whether the use of CVD risk visualization (Petal-X) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), alone or in combination, is associated with lifestyle changes and the perception of person-centered care (PCC) among patients at increased risk of CVD.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a 4-arm, single-blind, 2×2 factorial randomized controlled feasibility trial in primary care. A total of 119 participants were enrolled, of whom 101 completed the 6-month follow-up. Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 arms: (1) Petal-X CVD risk visualization+CGM; (2) CGM only; (3) Petal-X only; or (4) standard care with routine lifestyle counseling and no digital tools. CGM was used for 10 days in the CGM arms. Since this was a feasibility trial, no formal sample size calculation was performed. Primary outcomes are healthy lifestyle (Health Lifestyle and Personal Control Questionnaire [HLPCQ]) and perception of PCC (Person-Centered Practice Inventory-Service User [PCPI-SU]), and secondary outcomes (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 [SCORE2], anthropometrics, and biological age) were assessed at baseline and 6 months. Descriptive statistics and Kruskal-Wallis tests (K independent samples) were used for analyses.<h4>Results</h4>At baseline, mean SCORE2 values ranged from 3.84 (SD 2.08) in intervention group 3 to 4.87 (SD 2.61) in intervention group 1, with the control group having a mean value of 4.53 (SD 3.63). Regarding the assessment of a healthy lifestyle, the domain of daily routine had the highest baseline scores across all groups (eg, mean 19.24, SD 5.87 in intervention group 1), and these scores improved by the final evaluation, although there were no statistically significant differences (P=.42) in changes between the groups. The perception of PCC was rated highest across all groups in the domain of shared decision-making, with no statistically significant differences (P=.26) between the groups. Results indicated improvements in healthy lifestyle habits, but the impact of interventions on perceived changes remained insignificant.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Healthy lifestyle and perceived PCC scores improved, although no statistically significant between-group differences were found. Risk visualization appears to be a key tool for increasing CVD awareness and strengthening patient involvement in care planning. Longer interventions with larger samples are needed to clarify these effects and optimize digital tools for lifestyle change.",Svenšek A; Lorber M; Klemenc-Ketiš Z; Gosak L; Muršec D; Štiglic G,"Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Maribor, Žitna ulica 15, Maribor, 2000, Slovenia, 386 2 30 04 762.",JMIR public health and surveillance,2026-01-22,10.2196/83488,12.0,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Cardiovascular disease; Visualization; Randomized controlled trial; Continuous glucose monitoring; Rct; Healthy Lifestyle; Biological Age; Cgm; Petal-x

Complex flow patterns-such as tornado-like coiling and helical flows-provided insights into abnormal hemodynamics.<h4>Discussion</h4>Monoscopic 3DVT may hinder accurate interpretation of 4D data, especially in users with lower visual-spatial abilities (VSA). XR supports these users by making 4D data more intuitive to interpret, enabling performance comparable to those with higher VSA and thereby enhancing clinical data interpretation and decision-making.<h4>Take-home message</h4>With interactive 3D/4D models, XR can facilitate a more intuitive and accurate interpretation of clinical data, allowing users with lower VSA to achieve performance levels comparable to those with higher VSA.",van Dijk EB; Rijnberg FM; de Koning PJH; Westenberg JJM; Lamb HJ; Hazekamp MG; Haak MC; Hierck BP; Roest AAW,"Division of Prenatal Diagnosis and Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.

To overcome existing obstacles associated with performing sophisticated disease network analyses on EHR data, we developed DiNetxify, an open-source Python package implementing our recently introduced three-dimensional (3D) disease network analysis method ( https://hzcohort.github.io/DiNetxify/ ). DiNetxify provides a dedicated data class for handling various EHR data, comprehensive modular functions for executing complete 3D disease network analyses, and visualization functions for interactive exploration of results. The package is efficient, user-friendly, and optimized for large-scale EHR datasets. It supports diverse study designs, customizable analysis parameters, and parallel computing for enhanced performance. Through a case study utilizing UK Biobank data to investigate disease networks associated with short leukocyte telomere length, we demonstrated the capability of DiNetxify to identify meaningful disease clusters and progression patterns consistent with established knowledge while uncovering novel insights. Computationally, the software successfully completed analyses involving cohorts exceeding half a million exposed individuals within 17 h, using moderate computational resources. We thus anticipate that DiNetxify can significantly reduce technical barriers to facilitate broader adoption of advanced disease network analysis techniques by different researchers, thereby enhancing the exploration of EHR data to improve the understanding of holistic health dynamics.",Hou C; Liu H; Ahlqvist VH; Gisladottir EU; Yang Y; Yang H; Fang F; Valdimarsdóttir UA; Song H,"Mental Health Center and West China Biomedical Big Data Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.",European journal of epidemiology,2026-01-24,10.1007/s10654-025-01360-4,10.7,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract); electronic health record(kw,title,abstract)",Python; Electronic Health Record; Disease Trajectory; Comorbidity Network; Three-dimensional Disease Network

41564021,"Dharma: A novel, clinically grounded machine learning framework for pediatric appendicitis-Diagnosis, severity assessment and evidence-based clinical decision support.","Acute appendicitis is a common but diagnostically challenging surgical emergency in children. Existing linear scoring systems lack sufficient accuracy for standalone use, while advanced imaging is constrained by risks of sedation, contrast, and radiation. Furthermore, no available tools provide prognostic guidance. We introduce Dharma, a machine learning framework consisting of a clinically grounded imputer and two random forest classifiers for diagnosis and severity assessment. Designed for real-world bedside use, Dharma is open-sourced and accessible through a web application. Dharma achieved excellent diagnostic performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.98 [0.97-0.99] and accuracy of 93% [91-95]. For prognostic classification, it identified complicated appendicitis with high sensitivity (96% [93-99]) and negative predictive value (97% [94-99]). Even in cases without appendix visualization-a frequent limitation in resource-constrained settings-Dharma maintained strong performance (AUC-ROC 0.96 [0.93-0.99]), with specificity of 97% [93-100] and PPV of 93% [84-100] at a 44% threshold, and sensitivity of 92% [84-98] with NPV of 95% [91-99] at a 25% threshold. These threshold-dependent trade-offs enable Dharma to support both ruling in and ruling out appendicitis within diverse clinical workflows. Beyond pediatric appendicitis, Dharma's open-source framework and clinically grounded design also provide a generalizable foundation for developing equitable and practical decision-support systems in healthcare.",Thapa Kshetri A; Pahari S; Timilsina S; Chapagain B,"Department of Emergency Medicine and General Practice, Matri-Sishu Miteri Provincial Hospital, Pokhara, Gandaki, Nepal.",PLOS digital health,2026-01-21,10.1371/journal.pdig.0000908,6.7,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(title,abstract); clinical decision support(title)",

41574996,HistoNeRF: An Accessible and Intelligent Approach for Comprehensive 2D-to-3D Histological Assessment.,"Histological analysis is central to biomedical research and diagnostic pathology, yet conventional two-dimensional (2D) sectioning captures only limited aspects of tissue architecture. Critical spatial relationships-such as tumor boundaries, stromal organization, and vascular networks-remain obscured, restricting diagnostic accuracy and biological interpretation. HistoNeRF addresses these limitations by adapting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) tissue volumes from routine histological sections. In this study, 84 toluidine blue (TB)-stained murine ovarian sections were digitized, alignment-corrected, and integrated into volumetric models. Tissue segmentation was performed using a convolutional neural network, while visualization was achieved through an interactive, GPU-accelerated interface. To ensure accessibility and reproducibility, a Python-based graphical application (HistoNeRF GUI) was developed following Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles and containerized with Docker, allowing installation-free deployment via Docker Hub. HistoNeRF produced high-fidelity 3D reconstructions (SSIM = 0.92; Dice similarity coefficient = 0.88), enabling expert histologists to better visualize follicular structures, stromal compartments, and vascular elements. The containerized GUI was deployed successfully from Docker Hub, providing immediate access to 3D reconstruction without a complex local setup. By overcoming the inherent constraints of 2D microscopy, HistoNeRF enhances the visualization, interpretability, and reproducibility of histological architecture. The HCI-guided, cross-platform interface supports scalability and rapid adoption in digital pathology workflows. Although validation was limited to murine ovarian tissue and one staining protocol, this framework can be extended across tissue types and clinical datasets. HistoNeRF bridges routine histology and 3D volumetric analysis through accurate, interactive reconstructions that advance diagnostic precision and biomedical research. While demonstrated on 84 serial TB-stained ovarian sections, broader validation across tissues, stains, and pathological conditions remains future work; to support this, we provide a Dockerized, modular pipeline for straightforward extension.",Kiliç KD; Özyazici K; Kisaoğlu H; Yilmaz ZS; Horuz B; Taşkıran Özyazici A,"Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, İzmir, Türkiye.",Microscopy research and technique,2026-01-23,10.1002/jemt.70124,5.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw); data(abstract),Histology; 3D reconstruction; Medical imaging; Machine Learning; Neural Radiance Fields
41581134,CCTA as a Screening Tool (Invited Commentary). ,"Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has evolved into a key non-invasive tool for evaluating coronary artery disease, offering high sensitivity, detailed anatomical visualization, and strong prognostic value. Current Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography guidelines recommend CCTA as a first-line test for symptomatic patients, while limiting its use in asymptomatic individuals to select high-risk cases. Advantages in a screening context include early detection of subclinical atherosclerosis, prognostic assessment through high-risk plaque features, and facilitation of personalized preventive strategies. However, widespread screening faces challenges: procedural complexity, contrast and radiation exposure, psychological impact, and economic cost. Emerging integration of artificial intelligence promises to enhance efficiency, automate plaque quantification, and enable individualized risk prediction, potentially improving cost-effectiveness and clinical adoption. Future validation through randomized controlled trials and real-world data is needed to confirm the impact of CCTA-based screening on cardiovascular event reduction, healthcare resource use, and patient quality of life.",Wang Y; Yi Y; Wang Y,"From the Department of Radiology, State Key Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100730, China.",The British journal of radiology,2026-01-25,10.1093/bjr/tqaf261,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); data(abstract),
41555204,Explainable End-to-End Seizure Prediction via Dynamic Multiscale Cross-Band Fusion Filter Network.,"Epileptic seizure prediction based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the critical applications of medical artificial intelligence (AI), with considerable clinical potential for improving the quality of life of patients through early warnings. However, existing prediction models face dual challenges: insufficient feature representation and limited explainability of the decision. To address these challenges, this study proposes a dynamic multiscale cross-band fusion filter network (MCFNet) for end-to-end seizure prediction. Specifically, the model first decomposes EEG signals into multiscale components and incorporates a cross-band fusion attention mechanism to achieve multi-granularity signal fusion. Subsequently, the synchronous spectral filtering network, comprising both static and dynamic filtering modules, is designed to capture the periodic components and cross-channel dependencies in EEG signals. Notably, two explainable methods are introduced: a joint feature visualization strategy and an efficient feature ablation analysis, helping to bridge the gap between the ""black-box"" nature of deep learning and clinical needs. Evaluated on the CHB-MIT dataset, MCFNet achieves a sensitivity of 97.13%, a specificity of 97.22%, and a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.0326/h. Experimental results show that MCFNet not only exhibits superior predictive performance but also maintains a low FPR, offering a feasible scheme for clinical application of EEG-based seizure prediction.",Wang J; Wang Y; Nie W; Yuan Q,"Shandong Key Laboratory of Medical Physics and Image Processing, School of Communication and Electronic Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan 250358, P.

41553627,Hybrid imaging-clinical model for predicting microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma using deep learning-derived features from CT.,"The role of adipose tissue in predicting microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study proposes a method that integrates deep learning and machine learning techniques to investigate the role of adipose tissue in identifying MVI status in HCC patients. We collected enhanced Computed Tomography images from 517 HCC patients across two independent centers, dividing them into a training set, validation set, and test set. The model was constructed using adipose and tumor deep learning features along with clinical features, and the features were input into a classifier for prediction. The model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve(AUC), decision curve analysis, scatter plots, and box plots. Furthermore, we compared the model's performance with that of three radiologists. After incorporating the adipose tissue modality, the venous-phase AUC reached 0.866 (95% CI 0.803-0.920), while the arterial-phase AUC was 0.864 (95% CI 0.792-0.920). The inclusion of the adipose tissue modality provided significant value for clinical diagnosis, which was further validated through visualization analysis. Using predicted labels for grouping, it shows that the overall survival of the high-risk group was significantly lower than that of the low-risk group. Comparative analysis showed that the predictive performance of the model surpassed that of radiologists. Univariate analysis identified the adipose region as a risk factor for predicting MVI status. We developed a hybrid multimodal model that performed comparably to radiologists' assessments. The inclusion of the adipose tissue modality enhanced the accuracy of MVI diagnosis.",Miao S; Wang M; Dong Q; Xuan Q; Liu L; Sun M; Jiang Y; Jiang Y; Wang R; Wang Q; Liu Z; Ding X; Jin H,"School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China.",Physical and engineering sciences in medicine,2026-01-19,10.1007/s13246-025-01689-w,3.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract),Overall Survival; Multimodal; Deep Learning; Mvi; Lesser Omentum Layer
41569976,A pilot multimodal study of cervical cancer: Raman spectroscopy as a molecular fingerprint tool.,"Cervical cancer remains a significant global health burden, highlighting the need for more effective tools for early detection and tissue characterization. In this study, we propose a multimodal strategy that combines Raman spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to investigate the molecular and morphological features of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze biochemical signatures across different tissue regions tumor, necrotic, stromal, and glandular within the 813-1668 cm-1 range, identifying distinct molecular profiles between malignant and healthy areas. Specific vibrational peaks associated with DNA, proteins, and lipids were examined to track molecular changes related to tumor progression. AFM enabled nanoscale mapping of surface morphology, revealing structural irregularities associated with malignancy, while SEM provided detailed imaging of cellular and extracellular architecture, enhancing the visualization of cancer-induced morphological alterations. Although Raman spectroscopy has been studied for decades in cancer research, it has not yet replaced Pap smears and biopsies in clinical practice due to challenges in standardization, reproducibility, and clinical validation. This pilot study aims to serve as a stepping stone toward that goal, providing proof-of-concept data that may support the gradual translation of Raman spectroscopy into clinically relevant diagnostic workflows and underscores the potential of the technique, supported by complementary high-resolution imaging techniques, in the characterization of cervical cancer tissues. The integration of Raman, AFM, and SEM was used here as a pilot approach on paraffin-embedded samples, with AFM and SEM providing supportive morphological information while the long-term aim is to transfer Raman spectroscopy to fresh, untreated tissues, where its non-destructive and label-free nature could enable minimally invasive diagnostic applications.",Proietti A; De Angelis E; Buccini L; Leopizzi M; Pernazza A; Mura F; Accorinti A; Sbardella G; La Penna G; Maria Arseni R; Perniola G; Passeri D; Della Rocca C; Rossi M; Di Donato V,"Department of Basic and Applied Sciences for Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.",PloS one,2026-01-22,10.1371/journal.pone.0327286,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41565357,Superiority of Ferumoxytol MRI Over Pre-Contrast Imaging in Patients With Malignant Brain Lesions.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Patients with suspected brain tumors typically undergo MRI with an IV contrast agent to detect regions of disrupted BBB caused by the tumor. Gadolinium-based contrast agents are standard for enhancing lesion visualization but may be contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency. Ferumoxytol is an iron oxide nanoparticle approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, and unlike gadolinium-based contrast agents, is not contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. Our study aimed to evaluate whether ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI is superior to pre-contrast imaging for structural delineation of intra-axial malignant brain lesions.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This was a prospective, blinded re-read study of MRI images from patients with known or suspected intra-axial primary malignant or metastatic brain tumors, enrolled in an Institutional Review Board-approved research study, to support an FDA New Drug Application. Following FDA guidance, 3 independent neuroradiologist readers, blinded to contrast agent information, evaluated brain lesions of randomly ordered ferumoxytol-enhanced, gadolinium-enhanced, or pre-contrast images in separate reading sessions organized by an independent contract research organization. The 3 primary endpoints were the degree of contrast enhancement, border delineation, and the internal morphology of lesions, assessed using a 4-point visualization scale (1=none/poor; 4=excellent).<h4>Results</h4>In total, 153 patients were enrolled in the study (median age, 54 years; 57% male; 92% white). All 3 readers scored ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI images significantly higher than the pre-contrast images for visualizing lesions (p<0.001 for each primary endpoint). Average mean scores across readers for ferumoxytol-enhanced images were 2.8 for contrast enhancement, 3.0 for border delineation, and 2.6 for internal morphology, compared to 1.0, 2.1, and 1.7, respectively, for the pre-contrast images (p<0.001 for all). Safety data indicated that ferumoxytol administration was well-tolerated with adverse events consistent with its profile as an iron replacement therapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides robust evidence that ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI improves lesion visualization compared to pre-contrast imaging. Ferumoxytol as an MRI contrast agent in brain tumor imaging may provide a valuable clinical alternative to gadolinium-based contrast agents in appropriate patient groups.",Strauss WE; Fu R; Szidonya LK; Muir L; Huddleston AM; Branton DN; Neuwelt EA,"From Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR (R.F., L.K.S., L.M., A.M.H., E.A.N.); and Covis Pharma, a subsidiary of Azurity Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Woburn, MA (D.N.B.) williamestrauss@gmail.com.",AJNR.

41555071,A comprehensive framework for statistical testing of brain dynamics.,"Neural activity data can be associated with behavioral and physiological variables by analyzing their changes in the temporal domain. However, such relationships are often difficult to quantify and test, requiring advanced computational modeling approaches. Here, we provide a protocol for the statistical analysis of brain dynamics and for testing their associations with behavioral, physiological and other non-imaging variables. The protocol is based on an open-source Python package built on a generalization of the hidden Markov model (HMM)-the Gaussian-linear HMM-and supports multiple experimental modalities, including task-based and resting-state studies, often used to explore a wide range of questions in neuroscience and mental health. Our toolbox is available as both a Python library and a graphical interface, so it can be used by researchers with or without programming experience. Statistical inference is performed by using permutation-based methods and structured Monte Carlo resampling, and the framework can easily handle confounding variables, multiple testing corrections and hierarchical relationships within the data, among other features. The package includes tools developed to facilitate the intuitive visualization of statistical results, along with comprehensive documentation and step-by-step tutorials for data interpretation. Overall, the protocol covers the full workflow for the statistical analysis of functional neural data and their temporal dynamics.",Larsen NY; Paulsen LB; Ahrends C; Winkler AM; Vidaurre D,"Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. nylarsen@cfin.au.dk.",Nature protocols,2026-01-19,10.1038/s41596-025-01300-2,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41556901,Beyond training: Evaluation of practitioner behavior change booster components as part of a motivational interviewing training program.,"Even after intensive trainings, human and health service professionals may not optimally take up new approaches, such as motivational interviewing (MI). To decrease this knowledge-action gap, scaffolding of learning MI has been proposed. We developed (a) a workbook that aimed to boost MI uptake from the perspective of practitioner behavior change using goal setting, planning, self-monitoring, and social support and (b) structured peer group sessions to support this scaffolded learning process. We examine participants' perceptions of and engagement with these components and whether the use of workbook and peer group meetings was associated with changes in participants' MI skills. Social workers (<i>n</i> = 33) participated in an MI training over 2 months and responded to a survey about engagement at midintervention. At baseline and postintervention, real or simulated conversations with service users were assessed using the social work and interviewing motivationally coding system to identify the use of MI skills. Survey responses were aggregated into an engagement index, and its relationship to mean social work and interviewing motivationally assessed skill change was explored, using visualization methods in R. Approximately half of the respondents found the workbook useful for learning MI, while the other half reported that the workbook was difficult to use. The use of the workbook and peer group support was positively but modestly associated with skill improvement. Structured program to support behavior change to take up MI can improve training results. Basing training materials on both behavior change science strategies and feedback from the trainees has the potential to overcome the knowledge-action gap in MI trainings and promote sustained, high-quality training results.

41557730,FetCAT: Cross-attention fusion of transformer-CNN architecture for fetal brain plane classification with explainability using motion-degraded MRI.,"Fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been recognized as a vital diagnostic tool for identifying neurological anomalies during pregnancy. Accurate classification of fetal MRI planes is essential for effective prenatal neurological assessment, yet this task remains challenging in clinical practice. Key obstacles include the reliance on manual identification by specialized neuroradiologists, resource-constraints, motion-induced artifacts from fetal movement, and insufficient clinical interpretability of automated methods. This study presents FetCAT (Fetal Cross-Attention Transformer), a novel hybrid architecture that integrates a pre-trained Swin Transformer with a custom AdaptiveMed-CNN model through cross-attention fusion mechanisms for automated fetal brain MRI plane classification. The proposed hybrid architecture combines the global contextual understanding capabilities of transformers with the local feature extraction strengths of CNN through a sophisticated cross-attention mechanism. The model was trained and tested with a large-scale dataset of 52,561 motion-degraded fetal MRI slices from 741 patients, encompassing three anatomical planes and a gestational age of 19-39 weeks. Comprehensive comparative analyses were conducted across pre-trained CNN architectures, baseline and pre-trained transformer models, and the proposed hybrid configurations to evaluate the efficacy. Systematic ablation studies were performed to evaluate the impact of domain-specific data augmentation strategies on model performance. Robust statistical evaluation, including mean, variance, confidence intervals, and McNemar's test, substantiated the significant performance advantage of the proposed architecture over all competing models. Additionally, Grad-CAM-based explainability analysis was implemented to provide visual interpretations of the model's decision-making process, thereby enhancing clinical interpretability. The proposed cross-attention based Swin-AdaptiveMedCNN model achieved superior performance with 98.64% accuracy without data augmentation, substantially outperforming standalone CNN models, baseline and pre-trained transformers. Explainability analysis using Grad-CAM visualization demonstrated that the model focuses on clinically relevant anatomical landmarks. Contrary to common assumptions, ablation studies revealed that data augmentation consistently reduced model performance rather than improving it. This result can be attributed to the inherent diversity and natural variability already present in the dataset, which rendered additional synthetic variations counterproductive. Moreover, the proposed FetCAT model also demonstrated strong generalization capability, maintaining superior and statistically significant performance on an unseen OpenNeuro MRI test dataset with 81.0% accuracy. Thus, this study establishes a benchmark for automated fetal brain MRI plane classification.",Suha SA; Shahriyar R,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",PloS one,2026-01-20,10.1371/journal.pone.0340286,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41576341,Identification and Localization of Breast Tumor Components via a Convolutional Neural Network Based on High-Frequency Ultrasound Combined With Histopathologic Registration: Prospective Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Given the highly heterogeneous biology of breast cancer, a more effective noninvasive diagnostic tool that unravels microscopic histopathology patterns is urgently needed.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to identify cancerous regions in ultrasound images of breast cancer via convolutional neural network based on registered grayscale ultrasound images and readily accessible biopsy whole slide images (WSIs).<h4>Methods</h4>This single-center study prospectively included participants undergoing ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy procedures for Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 4 or 5 breast lesions for whom breast cancer was pathologically confirmed from July 2022 to February 2023 consecutively. The basic information, ultrasound image data, biopsy tissue specimens, and corresponding WSIs were collected. After core needle biopsy procedures, the stained breast tissue specimens were sliced and coregistered with an ultrasound image of a needle tract. Convolutional neural network models for identifying breast cancer cells in ultrasound images were developed using FCN-101 and DeepLabV3 networks. The image-level predictive performance was evaluated and compared quantitatively by pixel accuracy, Dice similarity coefficient, and recall. Pixel-level classification was illustrated through confusion matrices. The cancerous region in the testing dataset was further visualized in ultrasound images. Potential clinical applications were qualitatively assessed by comparing the automatic segmentation results and the actual pathological tissue distributions.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 105 participants with 386 ultrasound images of breast cancer were included, with 270 (70%), 78 (20.2%), and 38 (9.8%) images in the training, validation, and test datasets, respectively. Both models performed well in predicting the cancerous regions in the biopsy area, whereas the FCN-101 model was superior to the DeepLabV3 model in terms of pixel accuracy (86.91% vs 69.55%; P=.002) and Dice similarity coefficient (77.47% vs 69.90%; P<.001). The two models yielded recall values of 54.64% and 58.46%, with no significant difference between them (P=.80). Furthermore, the FCN-101 model had an advantage in predicting cancerous regions, while the DeepLabV3 model achieved more accurate predictive pixels in normal tissue (both P<.05). Visualization of cancerous regions on grayscale ultrasound images demonstrated high consistency with those identified on WSIs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The technique for spatial registration of breast WSIs and ultrasound images of a needle tract was established. Breast cancer regions were accurately identified and localized on a pixel level in high-frequency ultrasound images via an advanced convolutional neural network with histopathologic WSI as the reference standard.",Yao JQ; Zhou WW; Chai ZF; Ren F; Huang TY; Zhen TT; Shi HJ; Xie XY; Zhao Z; Xu M,"Department of Medical Ultrasonics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Guangzhou, 510080, China, +86-020-8776 518.",JMIR medical informatics,2026-01-23,10.2196/81181,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Neoplasms; Breast; Ultrasonography; Biopsy; Registration
41559507,Enhancing Explainability in AI-Based Interstitial Lung Disease Detection via Multi-Class Learning Based on Lesion Areas.,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) comprises a group of lung disorders characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the lung interstitium. Early detection is essential, yet identifying ILD on chest radiographs remains challenging. Recently, deep learning (DL) technologies have shown potential to improve diagnostic performance; however, their lack of transparency remains a major concern. This study employed a four-class classification scheme to develop a trustworthy and robust detection system for ILD. The explainability of three convolutional neural network (CNN) models and two transformer-based models was evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) scores and Dice coefficients, which quantified the consistency between actual lesion areas and the activation regions in heatmaps generated by five different visual explanation methods. The proposed four-class classification scheme yielded statistically significant increases in IoU scores and Dice coefficients for four visualization methods applied to the three CNN models, while maintaining equivalent classification performance compared with conventional binary classification. For the transformer-based models, the application of certain visualization methods to the four-class classification models also improved IoU scores and Dice coefficients, with the highest mean IoU and Dice coefficient reaching 0.356 and 0.483, although not across all combinations of visualization methods and DL models. These results demonstrate the utility of multi-class classification that leverages lesion area information to enhance model explainability. Furthermore, they underscore the importance of selecting suitable visualization methods for respective DL models. These findings may provide valuable insights to strengthen clinical decision-making, ultimately facilitating earlier detection and more reliable management of ILD.",Yamazaki A; Yamazaki R; Kita M; Kubo T; Noma S; Hashimoto S; Taguchi Y; Ishida T,"Department of Radiological Technology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Kobe Tokiwa University, Nagata-ku, Kobe, Hyogo, 653-0838, Japan.",Journal of imaging informatics in medicine,2026-01-20,10.1007/s10278-025-01790-2,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Interstitial Lung Disease; Chest Radiography; Explainable Ai; Explainability; Multi-class Learning
41557752,Multi-resolution tone mapping for high dynamic range medical ultrasound images.,"Ultrasound diagnostics is a key tool in obstetrics for detecting fetal anomalies and monitoring pregnancy, but image quality often declines in obese patients due to reduced contrast resolution. This pilot study develops and preliminarily validates a novel tone-mapping algorithm for enhancing contrast resolution in high dynamic range (HDR) ultrasound images. The method employs multi-resolution fusion with depth-adaptive weighting and depth compensation to improve contrast, enhance tissue differentiation, reduce noise, and preserve fine details. The algorithm was tested on 20 fetal ultrasound images focused on fetal kidney visualization. Quantitative evaluation showed a 5.4% mean increase in entropy and mean generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) improvements of 15.79%, 8.93%, and 17.39% between fetal kidneys and amniotic fluid, far-field objects and fluid, and fetal kidneys and adjacent tissues, respectively, compared with an existing method.

41565874,Safety and efficacy of the Chinese surgical robotic system (EDGE MP1000 &amp; MP2000) for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a single high-volume center.,"Robotic surgical systems have revolutionized minimally invasive procedures, offering enhanced three-dimensional visualization, high precision, and stable operation, particularly beneficial for radical prostatectomy. However, high costs have hindered the adoption of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in grassroots hospitals in China. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the EDGE Surgical Robotic System in performing RARP. A total of 129 patients who underwent RARP at our center between November 2023 and March 2025 were analyzed, with outcomes assessed including port placement to docking time, operative time, estimated blood loss, complications, pathological results, safety indicators, length of hospital stay, catheterization duration, postoperative PSA level, and early urinary continence recovery rate. All surgeries were completed successfully without conversion to laparoscopic or open procedures, with a mean setup time of 36.9 min, operative time of 176.3 min, and estimated blood loss of 128.1 mL. The positive surgical margin (PSM) rate was documented at 31.0%, with an average hospital stay of seven days and catheterization duration of 15.4 days. Importantly, no safety incidents were reported, and the average total cost of hospitalization and operative cost was CNY ¥59854.8 (USD $8287.8) and ¥36,249.2 (USD $5,019.26), respectively, indicating a cost-effective approach. While the study's retrospective design is a limitation, the findings provide preliminary evidence that the EDGE Surgical Robotic System is a safe and economically viable alternative for RARP, paving the way for broader implementation in similar healthcare settings.",Zhang Y; Xu P; Wen Y; Xu Y; Xu K; Li B; Zou J; Du W; Wang Y; Liu Y; Liang T; Xu A; Chen B,"Department of Urology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510280, China.",Journal of robotic surgery,2026-01-22,10.1007/s11701-025-02999-7,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),prostate cancer; Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy; New Robotic Platform; Edge Surgical Robot

Its efficacy and safety largely depend on accurate needle placement near target nerves under ultrasound (US) guidance. However, comprehensive didactic resources detailing peripheral nerve visualization remain limited. This paper aimed to develop an educational US-based manual to identify major peripheral nerves of the gluteal region, integrating anatomical, clinical, and sonographic perspectives. A narrative, anatomy-driven approach was used to describe the sonoanatomy and clinical relevance of five key nerves in the gluteal area: superior and inferior gluteal nerves, pudendal nerve, sciatic nerve, and posterior femoral cutaneous nerve.

41557614,Impact of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram on changes in surgical management among patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery in Thailand.,"Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is essential to perioperative cardiac care, providing enhanced cardiac visualization compared to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), especially in complex cases. While TEE is standard in high-income countries, its utilization in resource-limited settings is not as well-defined. This study aimed to quantify the impact of intraoperative TEE on surgical management at a major tertiary care center in Thailand and to investigate the effects of combining preoperative TTE and TEE on surgical planning. This prospective observational study enrolled 624 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery from January 2023 to January 2024. All patients received intraoperative TEE, with preoperative assessment conducted via either TTE alone or TTE combined with TEE. The primary outcome was the rate of change in surgical management prompted by new intraoperative TEE findings. Intraoperative TEE findings led to a change in surgical management in 10.58% of all cases (95% CI: 8.28-13.26). The rate of change was higher in patients undergoing preoperative TTE combined with TEE (16.13%) compared to those receiving TTE alone (9.60%); however, after multivariable adjustment, this difference was not statistically significant (adjusted RR 1.18, 95% CI: 0.67-2.09, p = 0.567). The type of surgery was the only independent predictor of management changes, with isolated valve surgery (adjusted RR 2.32, 95% CI: 1.05-5.16) and combined valve with CABG procedures (adjusted RR 3.03, 95% CI: 1.30-7.05) showing the highest likelihood of alteration. Postoperative outcomes, including 30-day mortality and complication rates, were comparable between patients with and without surgical management changes. In this study, intraoperative TEE was associated with changes in surgical decision-making in approximately 10% of cardiac surgeries, suggesting a potential clinical impact, particularly in complex valve-related procedures. The addition of a preoperative TEE, while associated with longer surgical wait times, did not independently associate with the likelihood of intraoperative changes. These findings underscore the crucial role of intraoperative TEE for real-time assessment and support its selective use in high-complexity cases, while also highlighting logistical challenges within resource-limited healthcare systems.",Lomarat N; Suppasilp C; Sidfeldt CK,"Department of Anesthesiology, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.",PloS one,2026-01-20,10.1371/journal.pone.0341156,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41556173,Ultrasound-mediated targeted micro/nanobubbles: breaking new boundaries in precision tumor therapy.,"Malignant tumors pose a public health challenge due to escalating incidence and mortality. Traditional treatments suffer from poor target specificity between healthy and tumor tissues, resulting in severe side effects. Immunotherapy is a pivotal advancement, but it faces poor tumor penetration, low targeting efficiency, inadequate drug delivery, immune evasion, and drug resistance. To overcome these challenges, ultrasound-mediated targeted micro/nanobubbles (UMT-MNBs) emerge, which is a noninvasive, highly targeted, and nonviral vector novel therapeutic method for malignant tumors. This approach overcomes drug resistance and facilitates the targeted release of therapeutic molecules. Concurrently, MNBs activate the immune system, enhance immune cell filtration, suppress tumor angiogenesis, and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). UMT-MNBs demonstrate synergistic potential with conventional therapies, showcasing substantial clinical promise. This review presents recent advances in UMT-MNBs for drug/gene delivery, hypoxia modulation, resistance mitigation, immune activation/regulation, and penetration of blood-brain barrier. It also introduces UMT-MNBs in combinatorial regimens, including chemo, radio, photothermal, photodynamic, and sonodynamic therapies, to reduce dosage, improve efficacy, and minimize toxicity, thereby advancing precision medicine in oncology. Finally, future research on UMT-MNBs is discussed. It is necessary to focus on optimizing ultrasound parameters, emphasizing surface functionalization of MNBs, elucidating the mechanisms of immune activation and regulation, and exploring multimodal combined treatment strategies. Our findings provide new insights into the visualization and real-time regulation capabilities of UMT-MNBs, driving the application of immunotherapy and combination therapies, opening new directions for targeted therapy, and facilitating breakthrough progress in cancer therapy.",Yang M; Zhang Z; Zhou H; Luo Z; Wang Y; Li S; Liu Z; Zhang X,"State Key Laboratory of High-performance Precision Manufacturing, Cancer Hospital of Dalian University of Technology, Liaoning Cancer Hospital & Institute, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",2026-01-20,10.1097/js9.0000000000004796,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Targeting; combined therapy; Cancer Treatment; Noninvasiveness; Umt–mnbs
41563878,Photon-counting computed tomography: a revolution in cardiac imaging.,"Photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) is an emerging advanced CT technology that differs from conventional energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT) scanners in its ability to directly convert incident X-ray photon energies into electrical signals. Since its commercial market introduction in 2021, several studies have identified advantages of this new technology in the field of cardiovascular imaging, including improved image quality due to an enhanced contrast-to-noise ratio, superior spatial resolution, reduced artefacts, and a reduced radiation dose. Nonetheless, radiation exposure with PCD-CT can vary depending on the acquisition mode and protocol used, highlighting the importance of tailored optimization in clinical practice. In particular, this new technology appears feasible in patients with a high plaque burden independent of morphology, unravelling new phenotypes of plaque, in patients with stents due to the improved visualization of the coronary in-stent lumen, potentially expanding the scope of CT. Early studies and clinical experience support these potential applications of PCD-CT in cardiovascular diagnostics, suggesting workflow optimization and improved patient management. In this review, the authors aim to describe the role of PCD-CT not only in the exclusion of coronary artery disease, grading of coronary stenosis and plaque imaging, but also in evaluation of cardiac chambers and myocardium for tissue characterization trying to understand whether PCD-CT has yet led to a true revolution and significant progress in cardiovascular imaging.",Pontone G; Mushtaq S; Pizzi C; Maurovich-Horvat P; Leipsic J; Serruys PW,"Perioperative Cardiology and Cardiovascular Imaging Department, Centro Cardiologico Monzino IRCCS, Via C.

41559033,Video Versus Direct Laryngoscope for Pediatric Intubation During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Simulation-based Trials.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is crucial for improving survival in cardiac arrest. Effective airway management can enhance outcomes but remains challenging due to anatomical and physiological factors in children. However, whether endotracheal intubation is superior to bag-valve-mask ventilation during CPR remains uncertain. Video laryngoscopes have emerged as an alternative to direct laryngoscopes, offering enhanced visualization; however, their efficacy for pediatric CPR remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of video laryngoscopes and direct laryngoscopes during pediatric CPR in simulation-based studies.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library was conducted up to February 2025. Only randomized controlled trials conducted in simulation settings comparing video and direct laryngoscopes in pediatric CPR were included. The primary outcomes were the first attempt success rate and the overall success rate. The secondary outcomes included intubation time, Cormack and Lehane grade as an indicator of glottic visualization, and dental compression. The risk of bias for the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Two reviewers independently evaluated each domain, and disagreements were resolved by consensus.<h4>Results</h4>Thirteen simulation-based studies with 2080 intubation attempts in manikins were included. Direct laryngoscopes demonstrated a 35% lower relative first-attempt success rate (RR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.59-0.71) and a 17% lower relative overall success rate (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.80-0.88) compared with video laryngoscopes. Intubation time was 8.13 seconds longer with direct laryngoscopes (MD: 8.13 s, 95% CI: 4.82-11.44). Furthermore, direct laryngoscopes were associated with a 39% lower relative likelihood of Cormack and Lehane grade 1 view (RR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49-0.76), and 6.05 times higher relative risk of dental compression (RR: 6.05, 95% CI: 2.93-12.52) compared with video laryngoscopes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Video laryngoscopes significantly improve intubation success rates and reduce intubation time during simulation-based pediatric CPR.

41579949,Anatomical Surgical Trajectory for Endoscopic Transcortical Third Ventriculostomy: A Neuronavigation-Guided Cadaveric Study with Pediatric Clinical Correlation.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a widely used surgical treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus. While the anatomical landmarks of the third ventricular floor are well described, the organization of white matter (WM) tracts along the transcortical ETV corridor and their correlation with neuronavigation and endoscopy remain insufficiently clarified. This study aimed to anatomically map the transcortical ETV trajectory from cortical entry to the third ventricular floor using stepwise cadaveric dissections integrated with neuronavigation and clinical correlation.<h4>Methods</h4>Stepwise WM dissections were performed in eight formalin-fixed human brains. Dissections were conducted with and without navigation guidance, extending from cortical entry points to the ventricular floor. Real-time tracking and endoscopic visualization were employed to document anatomical structures and their relationships to the corridor. The anatomically defined trajectory was subsequently applied in a pediatric cohort undergoing neuronavigation-guided transcortical ETV.<h4>Results</h4>Neuronavigation-guided cortical entry points were localized between the superior and middle frontal gyri, avoiding eloquent cortical regions. Stepwise dissections demonstrated the orderly traversal of U-fibers, superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, fronto-aslant tract, corona radiata, and callosal fibers before ventricular entry. Endoscopic correlation confirmed the midline tuber cinereum, just anterior to the mammillary bodies, as the optimal perforation site. In the clinical series, this trajectory was associated with favorable radiological and clinical outcomes without permanent neurological deficits.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Defining the transcortical ETV route on the basis of detailed WM anatomy and neuronavigation enables a reproducible and anatomically defined surgical pathway.

The diagnostic criteria include both characteristic symptoms and objective findings; however, intermittent symptom presentation often prevents confirmation during clinic visits, leading to underdiagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of a patient-operated portable digital otoscope for confirming the diagnosis of PET.<h4>Study design</h4>Prospective observational study.<h4>Setting</h4>The study was conducted between January 2024 and July 2025 in a tertiary referral center.<h4>Patients</h4>Patients with possible PET, defined by characteristic symptoms and positional improvement, but without observed tympanic membrane (TM) fluctuations during in-clinic evaluation.<h4>Intervention</h4>Patient-operated portable digital otoscope for confirming the diagnosis of PET.<h4>Main outcome measure</h4>Clinical utility of a patient-operated portable digital otoscope for confirming the diagnosis of PET.<h4>Results</h4>Among 62 ears from 48 patients with possible or definite PET, 31 (50%) were initially diagnosed with definite PET. Of 24 patients (31 ears) with possible PET findings, 15 (18 ears) participated in the study. TM fluttering was detected in 8 ears in patient-operated recordings, increasing the definite PET rate from 50.0% to 62.9% (P <0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Patient-operated portable digital otoscopy significantly increased the objective confirmation of PET and addressed the diagnostic gap due to intermittent symptoms. This approach enables timely symptom-triggered TM visualization beyond clinical settings, potentially reducing diagnostic delays and unnecessary repeat visits.",Yun JM; Cheon TU; Park S; Bae SH,"Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chung-Ang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",2026-01-19,10.1097/mao.0000000000004824,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Ear; Eustachian tube; Middle; tympanic membrane; Otoscopy; Otoscopes
41559192,Enhancing link prediction in biomedical knowledge graphs with BioPathNet.,"Understanding complex interactions in biomedical networks is crucial for advancements in biomedicine, but traditional link prediction (LP) methods are limited in capturing this complexity. We present BioPathNet, a graph neural network framework based on the neural Bellman-Ford network (NBFNet), addressing limitations of traditional representation-based learning methods through path-based reasoning for LP in biomedical knowledge graphs. Unlike node-embedding frameworks, BioPathNet learns representations between node pairs by considering all relations along paths, enhancing prediction accuracy and interpretability, and allowing visualization of influential paths and biological validation. BioPathNet leverages a background regulatory graph for enhanced message passing and uses stringent negative sampling to improve precision and scalability. BioPathNet outperforms or matches existing methods across diverse tasks including gene function annotation, drug-disease indication, synthetic lethality and lncRNA-target interaction prediction. Our study identifies promising additional drug indications for diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and Alzheimer's disease, validated by medical experts and clinical trials. In addition, we prioritize putative synthetic lethal gene pairs and regulatory lncRNA-target interactions. BioPathNet's interpretability will enable researchers to trace prediction paths and gain molecular insights.",Hu EY; Oleshko S; Firmani S; Cheng H; Zhu Z; Ulmer M; Arnold M; Colomé-Tatché M; Tang J; Xhonneux S; Marsico A,"Computational Health Center, Helmholtz Center Munich, Oberschleißheim, Germany.",Nature biomedical engineering,2026-01-20,10.1038/s41551-025-01598-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41562718,Quinoline/Naphthalene-Embedded PSMA Probes for Precise PET Imaging with Minimized Undesired Retention.,"Accumulation in nontarget tissues, particularly the salivary glands, remains a major challenge for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radiotherapeutics, narrowing the theranostic window. In this work, we developed quinoline/naphthalene-derived PSMA radiotracers ([<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NNA<sub>8</sub>P<sub>1</sub>, [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NNB<sub>8</sub>P<sub>1</sub>, and [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NCB<sub>8</sub>P<sub>1</sub>) to minimize nontarget accumulation through systematic molecular optimization. All probes exhibited excellent stability <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In PSMA-positive PC3-PIP cells, a significant uptake was observed with nanomolar binding affinities. Visual drug screening and first-in-human studies were conducted. In PSMA-positive tumor models, micro-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution demonstrated high tumor uptake, significantly blocked by coinjection with PSMA inhibitors. The probes showed blood clearance primarily and a low background retention. In initial clinical evaluations, [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-NCB<sub>8</sub>P<sub>1</sub> outperformed the widely used [<sup>18</sup>F]PSMA-1007, enabling clear visualization of metastatic lesions.

41557208,Ultrasound-guided minimally invasive thoracotomy for removal of migrating grass Awn in a Cat.,"Migrating grass awns are a rare cause of thoracic reactions in cats, resulting in pleural effusion, inflammation, infection and granulomatous responses. Diagnosis and localization are challenging, and treatment commonly requires invasive surgical intervention. We report a case of a 5-year-old, neutered male, domestic shorthair cat referred for pleural effusion and suspected intrathoracic vegetal foreign body. Thoracic ultrasonography confirmed the presence of pleural effusion and a linear hyperechoic structure within the pleural space was visualized. An ultrasound-guided minimally invasive thoracotomy was performed through the right fifth intercostal space and intraoperative ultrasonography was useful to precisely locate and remove the foreign body using a Hartmann ear forceps. Cytological analysis was performed on the pleural fluid and bacteriological analysis was performed on both the pleural fluid and the retrieved foreign body. The cytologic findings were consistent with an exudative effusion but no bacteria were isolated on both direct and enrichment bacterial cultures; empirical antibiotic treatment with marbofloxacin was continued. The patient recovered uneventfully, and follow-up revealed complete resolution of the clinical signs. This case report highlights the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided minimally invasive approach for intrathoracic vegetal foreign body removal in a cat. The transthoracic and intraoperative ultrasound can be useful for visualization and exact localization of the grass awn, minimizing surgical trauma and improving the outcome.",Valderrama VFR; Valeri F; Caivano D; Moretti G; Bufalari A,"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Perugia, Via San Costanzo 4, 06126, Perugia, Italy.",Veterinary research communications,2026-01-20,10.1007/s11259-026-11072-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Foxtail; Ultrasonography; Surgery; Feline; Foreign Body
41571877,Free-breathing phase-resolved functional lung (PREFUL) low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI) of pulmonary dysfunction after surviving childhood cancer.,"<h4>Background</h4>Childhood cancer survivors have a high risk of chronic multi-organ disease that does not plateau over time. To date, there is a lack of sensitive diagnostic techniques that allow early detection of tissue damage before clinical symptoms occur, particularly regarding pulmonary function. Free-breathing phase-resolved functional lung (PREFUL) low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI) may enable visualization and quantification of functional and structural lung damage without the need of specific contrast agents.<h4>Methods</h4>In this single-center, cross-sectional diagnostic study, we performed LF-MRI in a cohort of n = 27 children and adolescents (age range: 5 to 17 years) after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 21) and Hodgkin's disease (HD; n = 6) to determine the frequency of morphologic and functional lung parenchymal changes.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we show that despite the absence of clinical symptoms, significant time-dependent pulmonary ventilation and perfusion defects are detected. A negative correlation between the time after the end of therapy and defect-free lung tissue in the cohort of patients treated for ALL (Spearman-coefficient = - 0.69, p = 0.0005) is observed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results suggest an increase in pulmonary ventilation and perfusion defects preceding the increase in chronic disease that has already been reported in this patient population. Further research is needed to determine whether the functional abnormalities described in this study are an early morphological correlate of developing organ damage that may become clinically evident over time. PREFUL MRI may be an effective and highly sensitive tool for early detection of these changes in lung function, allowing longitudinal studies for risk stratification and potential future treatment adaptation.",Dierl A; Hinsen M; Wild EM; Bayerl N; Heiss R; Nagel AM; Schmidt S; Grimm R; Vogel-Claussen J; Voskrebenzev A; Naumann-Bartsch N; Anderheiden F; Huber F; Mueller N; Schoeffl I; Woelfle J; Uder M; Regensburger AP; Knieling F; Karow A,"Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU) Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany. alexander.dierl@uk-erlangen.de.",Communications medicine,2026-01-22,10.1038/s43856-025-01365-w,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41565247,Macrophage-Mimicking Biomimetic Microbubbles for Early Ultrasound Molecular Imaging of Acute Rejection in Heart Transplantation.,"Acute rejection (AR) is an important cause of heart graft injury and failure. Accurate diagnosis of AR is essential to achieving early intervention and improving the prognosis of patients. Current clinical monitoring of AR requires repeated invasive endocardial biopsies, and there is an urgent need to develop a noninvasive diagnostic technique. As antigen-presenting cells, macrophages play an important role in adaptive immunity, such as the early activation of T cells in AR, and are considered to be key drivers of AR. Macrophage membrane biomimetic microbubbles (MB-Mφ) inherit a variety of functional proteins from the macrophage membranes. They can recognize and target the inflammatory site in the heart and use ultrasound imaging signals to determine the inflammatory progression of AR. This ""ultrasound probe"" can be regarded as a dynamic tracer and visualization tool for the behavior of macrophages. MB-Mφ prepared in this study showed superior stability and ultrasound imaging performance, and its ability to adhere to inflammatory vascular endothelial cells was significantly better than that of ordinary microbubbles (MB). In the rat allograft model, the signal intensity of the MB-Mφ group was significantly higher than that of the ordinary microbubbles group. In addition, after injection of MB-Mφ, the signal intensity in the allograft group was significantly higher than that in the isograft group, and the pathological results confirmed that the signal intensity of MB-Mφ was positively correlated with the number of macrophages infiltrating the transplanted heart and the progression of AR. These findings indicate that macrophage membrane biomimetic microbubbles can mimic the inflammatory chemotactic behavior of macrophages and noninvasively detect AR in heart transplantation, which provides a new molecular imaging tool for early diagnosis.",Wang C; Li G; Chen J; Liu C; Liu Y; Ai X; Yang Y; Leng X; Wang Z; Jiang S,"Department of Ultrasound, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2026-01-21,10.1021/acsami.5c24619,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Macrophages; Heart transplantation; Acute rejection; Ultrasound Molecular Imaging; Biomimetic Microbubbles
41580736,Global research landscape of inborn errors of immunity: a bibliometric analysis (1991-2025).,"<h4>Background</h4>Inborn errors of immunity (IEI), though individually rare, collectively represent a significant disease burden. From 1980 to 2024, classified IEI disorders expanded from dozens to 559 entities, reflecting advances ranging from immunoglobulin replacement to gene therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>This bibliometric analysis-a comprehensive mapping of the global IEI landscape-analyzed 7,455 publications (1991-2025) from Web of Science Core Collection using Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace.<h4>Results</h4>Key findings: (1) Annual publication growth: 10.27% (H-index = 173); (2) US dominance: 36.3% publications, 115,221 citations, and TLS = 105,825; (3) Research priorities: Immunodeficiency mechanisms, clinical diagnostics, and key diseases (SCID, CVID, APDS); (4) Therapeutic frontiers: HSCT, gene therapy, targeted signaling inhibitors.

41581079,Application of Three-Dimensional Inversion and Crystalvue and Realisticvue Rendering Technology in the Diagnosis of Fetal Malformations of Cortical Development. ,"Malformations of cortical development (MCD) impact fetal neurodevelopment. This study evaluates the use of 3D inversion and Crystalvue and Realisticvue (3D-ICRV) technologies in diagnosing MCD prenatally. A retrospective cohort study of 232 suspected MCD patients and 50 fetuses with normal brain development who underwent fetal brain ultrasound at the Women and Children's Hospital of Xiamen (2023.1-2024.12) was conducted. Ultrasound images were collected at 20-25, 26-28, and 29+ gestational weeks. Morphological analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed diagnostic performance. Postnatal follow-up focused on motor and languagel outcomes. Genetic results were also analyzed. Among the 232 suspected patients, 57 were ultimately diagnosed with MCD, while 175 participants experienced early developmental delay that resolved or remained only mildly delayed before delivery. 3D-ICRV technology provided superior visualization of cortical structures. Fetuses with delayed sylvian fissure or parietooccipital sulcus development but normal insula had higher chances of subsequent normalization. Diagnostic accuracy improved with gestational age, with 3D models demonstrating accuracy of 0.8136, 0.8750, and 0.9831 at 20-25, 26-28, and 29+ weeks, respectively. The insula was the most predictive structure at 20-25 weeks (AUC 0.8035). Postnatal follow-up indicated that most fetuses with prenatally delayed brain development showed normal development, though some had delays. 3D-ICRV technology enhances MCD diagnosis compared with 2D ultrasound.

41570337,A Novel Cannula Crafted From Disposable Syringes for Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release in the Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.,"ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a disposable sterile syringe-derived cannula for endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and to evaluate the clinical outcomes of this technique in patients undergoing ECTR.MethodsECTR was performed on patients with CTS. A 2.5 mL disposable sterile syringe was modified into a cannula with an upper calibrated section and a transparent lower portion. A skin incision, approximately 1 cm in length, was made on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon at the proximal wrist crease level. Following blunt dissection, the cannula was inserted into the wound, and both the arthroscope and a spade knife were introduced simultaneously. The instruments were advanced with the spade knife cutting the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) from proximal to distal under direct visualization. The wound was closed using silk sutures. All patients were followed for a minimum of 6 months postoperatively. At the final follow-up, the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire's symptom severity score (SSS) and function status score (FSS), along with the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, were recorded and compared to preoperative values.ResultsA total of 16 patients (19 wrists) with a mean age of 52.5 years were enrolled between May 2024 and December 2024. All patients completed the follow-up, with a median duration of 8 months. At the final follow-up, VAS scores, SSS-BCTSQ, and FSS-BCTSQ demonstrated significant improvements from baseline (<i>P</i> < 0.001).

41563938,In vivo characterization of colored tattoo ink distribution in human skin using non-invasive two-photon tomography combined with FLIM.,"In recent years, multicolored tattoos have gained popularity among young individuals. However, the behavior of tattoo inks in the skin, including their distribution, accumulation, and long-term effects, remains poorly understood, partly due to limited in vivo imaging techniques. This study employs picosecond-pulsed two-photon excited fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (TPE-FLIM) to non-invasively visualize the deposition of colored tattoo ink pigments (blue, red, green, yellow, orange, purple and black) in human skin in vivo at depths of up to ≈150 µm. The study reveals that tattoo ink agglomerates are present across various skin layers, ranging from the stratum corneum to the reticular dermis. Tattoo ink pigments were predominantly observed within dermal cells, including mast cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts, suggesting that these cells act as long-term reservoirs for the pigments. Additionally, ink residues were detected in epidermal cells, including keratinocytes, dendritic cells, and basal cells, indicating a continuous low-level release of the ink even in old tattoos. Furthermore, the analysis showed that melanin can be distinguished from certain tattoo ink pigments using phasor approach combined with TPE autofluorescence imaging. The TPE-FLIM technique enables in vivo visualization of epidermal dendritic cells and dermal fibroblasts, which are otherwise undetectable using conventional optical methods without staining. This method holds significant potential for clinical dermatology by offering insights into cellular uptake, accumulation, and long-term effects of tattoo inks, thereby supporting the management of tattoo-related complications.",Lopez Guardado DA; Lepekhina TB; Korkishko SD; Kistenev YV; Nikolaev VV; Darvin ME,,Skin pharmacology and physiology,2026-01-21,10.1159/000550617,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41557248,Melatonin Promotes Neurogenesis via the JAK2/STAT3 Pathway in Hypoxic-Ischemic Neonatal Rats.,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is a leading cause of neurological dysfunction and long-term disability in newborns. Lactate accumulation and metabolic disturbances after brain injury inhibit neurogenesis, while the restorative capacity of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) is essential for neural reconstruction. Melatonin (Mel) alleviates neonatal brain injury, but its effects on NSCs proliferation and migration remain unclear, and the visualization methods for dynamic monitoring of metabolic changes are inadequate. In this study, a neonatal rat model of HIBD was established, and multimodal MRI combined with histological techniques was employed to evaluate the effects of Mel on NSCs regeneration and metabolic conditions in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Using these techniques, the potential neuroprotective effects of Mel via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway were investigated. Multimodal MRI revealed that Mel increased cerebral blood flow and oxygen saturation, reduced lactate levels, improved brain metabolic microenvironment, and alleviated brain damage caused by HIBD. EdU/Nestin and EdU/DCX staining revealed that Mel promoted the proliferation and migration of endogenous NSCs, thereby enhancing neurogenesis. In addition, the use of a JAK2 inhibitor (WP1066) and agonist (C-A1) verified that Mel exerted its protective effects by down-regulating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Morris water maze further confirmed that Mel improved spatial learning and memory function in neonatal rats with HIBD. Multimodal MRI offers a visual basis for monitoring metabolic changes and therapeutic effects, while Mel enhances neurogenesis and mitigates brain injury through inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, thus providing a theoretical basis for the clinical application of Mel in HIBD in neonates.",Wang Y; Yu M; Liu C; Zhang X; Qin Y; Meng N; Xue N; Li Y; Liu D; Jiang J; Wang X,"School of Medical Imaging, Shandong Second Medical University, No. 7166, Baotong West Street, Weifang, 261053, Shandong, China.",Neurochemical research,2026-01-20,10.1007/s11064-026-04671-4,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Melatonin; hypoxic-ischemic brain damage; Proliferation And Migration; Multiparametric Mri; Jak2/stat3 Pathway
41431455,Miniaturized device for assessing calcification propensity of biohybrid implants under continuous flow.,"Biohybrid implants are a promising development for cardiovascular disease treatment but suffer from problems like thrombogenesis and calcification. However, testing and validating biohybrid implants can be difficult and expensive due to material handling, fabrication methods and specialty medium components. The devices used to test potential samples can be large and expensive, requiring significant amounts of cell culture medium to operate. Additional, conventional static cell culture conditions do not accurately represent the vascular environment as shear and mechanical forces play key roles in the development of calcification. To address these challenges, a miniaturized, dual-channel flow chamber was designed and validated that allowed for real-time visualization of biohybrid calcification in a physiological environment. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to determine the flow characteristics that generated physiological shear stress homogeneously across the sample surface. Micro particle tracking velocimetry measurements validated the simulated shear stresses near the sample surface. Two implant materials used for biohybrid construction, bovine pericardium and polycarbonate urethane, were inserted in the device and exposed to a flowing calcification medium for 14 days. Fluorescent fetuin-A was introduced into the calcification medium for real-time calcification monitoring. The two materials were compared with matched samples calcified in a large fatigue tester for 14 days. Our results showed similar material calcification for bovine pericardium and no calcification for polycarbonate urethane in the large fatigue tester and in our newly developed device. Biohybrid textile-reinforced fibrin-based scaffold populated with vascular smooth muscle cells started to calcify over 7 days in calcification medium. We conclude that this platform will provide novel insights into the origin and progression of pathological calcification and its potentially harmful health effects, which can occur as a result of tissue or metabolic abnormalities, disease, or implantation of certain biomaterials, by providing the ability to monitor the progression of calcification in biohybrid implants in real time, while also minimizing the cost and size of samples and reagents required for testing.",Morgan AD; Dzhanaev R; Gorgels A; Ritter J; Clauser JC; Stockmeier F; Stüwe L; Böhm C; Jockenhoevel S; Steinseifer U; Jahnen-Dechent W,"Helmholtz Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Biointerface Lab, RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany. willi.jahnenrwth-aachen.de.",Lab on a chip,2026-01-20,10.1039/d5lc00742a,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41574747,Second Harmonic Generation Imaging as a Virtual Biopsy for Upper Extremity Nerve Injuries: A Cadaver Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>A timely assessment of nerve damage is needed for early clinical decision-making. Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy visualizes collagen. This study investigated: Can SHG imaging distinguish collagenous substructures in human nerves? Can SHG imaging detect structural damage in human nerves following destructive stretch injury?<h4>Methods</h4>Six human upper extremities were equally divided into 2 groups: A no-injury and a load-to-failure (LTF) group. The median, radial, and ulnar nerves were surgically exposed. Arms were placed on an Instron material testing system. Eight centimeters of each nerve was secured under 2 pins. A hook was raised from beneath the nerve until complete nerve transection occurred. After the experiment, LTF nerves were excised along their full length. No-injury and LTF nerves were placed in isotonic saline under an FVMPE-RS Multiphoton Microscope using a laser wavelength of 900 nm to induce an SHG signal. Z-stack images were acquired using a wavelength of 45 nm. Nerves were then harvested for histology.<h4>Results</h4>Histology sections of NI nerves exhibited normal peripheral nerve architecture. All collagenous substructures visible on histology were clearly identifiable and distinguishable on SHG images of uninjured nerves. In LTF nerves, epineurium rupture and exposed fascicles were clearly identifiable on SHG imaging. Epineurial collagen of LTF nerves appeared heavily disorganized, with short fiber fragments following no clear trajectory. Findings were consistent among nerve types.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first study to visualize human nervous tissue using SHG microscopy.

41566127,Robotic Single-Port Right Hepatectomy: Unveiling New Possibilities.,"<h4>Background</h4>Minimally invasive liver resections, particularly right hepatectomy, are technically challenging. Single-port (SP) laparoscopic liver resection has been constrained by restricted triangulation and unfavorable ergonomics.<sup>1</sup> The robotic SP platform offers enhanced dexterity, 3D visualization, and wristed instrumentation that may overcome these limitations.<sup>2, 3</sup> Nevertheless, its use in major hepatectomy is currently limited, and only a few early experiences have been reported.<sup>4, 5</sup> We present a case demonstrating the technical feasibility and perioperative safety of robotic SP right hepatectomy in a patient with intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) further complementing our recently published series.<sup>6</sup> METHODS: A 66-year-old male with IPNB in segment 6 with right lobe atrophy underwent robotic SP right hepatectomy using the da Vinci SP® system. The patient was placed in a 30° head-up and 15° right-up semi-lateral position. A 5-cm transumbilical main port and a 12-mm assistant port were used. A 2-mm percutaneous puncture was used for rubber-band traction without trocar insertion and later served to exteriorize the drain. Inflow was intermittently controlled using a Pringle maneuver (video).<h4>Results</h4>The procedure was completed successfully without conversion or additional ports. Operative time was 241 minutes and estimated blood loss was 100 mL without transfusion. Pathologic examination confirmed IPNB with high-grade dysplasia and no invasion. Resection margins were negative. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 without complications.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This case demonstrates the technical feasibility and perioperative safety of robotic SP right hepatectomy in complex hepatobiliary disease.

41559460,From Avoiding Empty Packets to Real-Time Diagnosis: The Value of Robotic Ultrasound-Guided Surgery in Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection.,"<h4>Background</h4>Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is recommended for staging in endometrial and cervical cancers,<sup>1,2</sup> offering lower morbidity than systematic lymphadenectomy. However, limitations persist, including low frozen-section accuracy, tissue loss during molecular analysis, and empty packets, especially in obese patients.<sup>3</sup> In digital surgery, robotic intraoperative ultrasound has emerged as a promising tool to overcome these challenges, enhancing real-time decision-making and diagnostic accuracy.<sup>4</sup> This video presents three ultrasound-based scenarios illustrating the potential of this image-guided surgical technique.<sup>5</sup> PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective clinical study (R-LYNUS, NCT06621823) is ongoing to evaluate robotic intraoperative ultrasound for SLN assessment. Procedures are performed on the da Vinci Xi platform using the Arietta L43K(2-12 MHz, Hitachi) drop-in probe. Real-time ultrasound is displayed in split-view mode via Tile Pro, allowing simultaneous ultrasound and endoscopic visualization. SLN imaging is performed in vivo and ex vivo according to Vulvar International Tumor Analysis (VITA) consensus. Patients undergoing robotic SLN dissection for cervical or endometrial cancer are included, with final histology as reference.<h4>Results</h4>Three intraoperative scenarios were observed: (1) normal SLN morphology; (2) adipose tissue without nodal structures (empty packets); and (3) nodes with cortical thickening, heterogeneous echostructure, and transcapsular vascularization suspected of metastasis. Ultrasound findings correlated with histology in all cases, supporting its role in real-time staging.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Robotic intraoperative ultrasound is feasible, safe, and reproducible, potentially preventing empty packets and enabling nodal assessment without tissue loss. Integration of high-frequency ultrasound could further improve spatial resolution and metastatic detection.

41559816,Status of evidence on efficacy and safety of Indian traditional medicine (Ayush) for COVID-19: a qualitative review and evidence map synthesis.,"<h4>Background</h4>The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Its rapid spread, high mutation rate, and challenges in containment led the WHO to declare it a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Traditional medicine played a supportive role during the COVID-19 pandemic by offering immune-boosting and symptom-relieving remedies, especially in regions with limited access to conventional healthcare. Several countries, including India, have integrated traditional therapies with modern treatment protocols to enhance patient outcomes and reduce disease burden.<h4>Objectives</h4>This review aims to critically synthesize the existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of Ayush interventions in the management of COVID-19 in India. It seeks to qualitatively analyze published literature and clinical trial data, and to develop an evidence map categorizing interventions by type and associated clinical outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive literature search was conducted across seven electronic databases, including the National Repository on R&D Initiatives of the Ministry of Ayush, WHO COVID-19 dashboard for clinical trials, AYUSH Research Portal, PubMed, Cochrane Library, WHO ICTRP, and CTRI. Studies published between 2019 and June 2024 were considered. A total of 3626 records were identified (2572 from indexed databases and 1054 from trial registries). After removing 640 duplicates, 2986 studies were screened for title and abstract. Following exclusion of 802 records, full-text assessment was performed on the remaining studies. After screening, 304 studies were included in the final review (178 Ayurveda, 22 Siddha, 31 Homeopathy, 22 Unani, and 51 Yoga). Risk of bias was assessed using the ROB 2 and ROBINS-I tools. Data extraction and collation were performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 304 studies were included, comprising 58 (19.1%) prophylaxis studies, 151 (49.7%) treatment studies, and 17 (5.6%) post-COVID rehabilitation studies across different Ayush systems. Ayurveda accounted for the largest proportion of publications (n = 178), followed by Yoga (n = 51). Among the randomized controlled trials, approximately half were assessed as having low-to-moderate risk of bias, whereas the remaining studies exhibited high or unclear risk of bias, primarily due to inadequate reporting of randomization procedures, allocation concealment, and blinding. Considerable methodological variability was observed across studies, including differences in intervention type, duration, outcome measures, and quality assessment scores.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While there is significant data on Ayush and COVID-19, current studies vary too widely to be definitive. Future research must prioritize rigorous scientific standards if these systems are to be effectively integrated into public health responses.",Ahmad A; Gundeti MS; R M; Wilson E; Itrat M; Javed G; Quamri MA; Chalia DS; Yadav P; P AT; P KK; S AC; S MH; Dileep A; P SS; R G,"CCRAS, New Delhi, India.",Systematic reviews,2026-01-20,10.1186/s13643-026-03069-1,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Homeopathy; Yoga; Ayurveda; Siddha; Unani; Ayush; Risk Of Bias; Qualitative Review; Covid-19; Evidence Map; Indian Traditional Medicine
41571100,Promoting knowledge transfer-A RE-AIM evaluation of a VA Healthcare System's success strategies in improving patient safety through deprescribing.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Polypharmacy is a global concern. Evidence-based medication deprescribing algorithms and scholarly works suggest targeted interventions. The Veterans Administration (VA) launched the VIONE (Vital, Important, Optional, Not indicated, Every medication should have an indication) polypharmacy reduction methodology for older adults in 2016. This study aims to identify the experiences, facilitators, barriers, and lessons learned from the VA Healthcare System (VAHS) adoption of VIONE to provide information for knowledge translation to other implementation teams.<h4>Practice description</h4>The VAHS is a tertiary VA care facility in the Caribbean, providing care at 11 locations.<h4>Practice innovation</h4>Although VIONE has been adopted in about 138 medical centers, most of these sites have struggled to sustain the intervention. The VAHS in the Caribbean adopted the methodology in 2020 and has successfully implemented it with both sustainability and clinical effectiveness. This study offers insights into what facilitated their success and how barriers were mitigated.<h4>Evaluation methods</h4>This study employs the REAIM framework to examine the resulting deprescribing outcomes of a tertiary VA care facility. Data were collected through qualitative interviews and from the VIONE implementation dashboards. Qualitative data were analyzed using deductive content analysis, while the VIONE dashboard was used to synthesize the quantitative data.<h4>Results</h4>The VAHS implementation team achieved significant deprescribing success from 2020 to 2024, eliminating over 105,000 medications, positively impacting over 21,000 Veterans, and avoiding approximately $5.7 million in costs. Themes from interviews include provider elements (building rapport and ongoing education and training) and patient-centered components (customizing holistic interventions, providing education, shared decision-making, and ensuring a gradual deprescribing process). Proper follow-up and targeted monitoring further enhanced their effective strategies. The reduction in medications, the cost avoided, and the number of Veterans impacted by the deprescribing interventions were outcomes of the robust deprescribing approach used by the interdisciplinary team.<h4>Conclusion</h4>VAHS demonstrated its commitment to patient-centered care by successfully implementing and maintaining the VIONE model. This study provides valuable insights into effective implementation strategies crucial for successful maintenance, facilitating knowledge transfer. When applying this knowledge to other settings, it is important to consider the unique facilitators and barriers and use a tailored approach.",Omuya H; Battar S; García-Carmona L; Malta J; Manning J,"Assistant Professor, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Wisconsin, Madison.

41576298,Implementation of Suspected Cancer Initiative to Improve Cancer Diagnosis Timeliness in a Large Public Hospital System.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the impact of the Suspected Cancer Initiative (SCI)-an electronic medical record (EMR)-based suspected cancer flag-on diagnostic timeliness across a large public hospital system. We aimed to analyze the program's impact on reducing time to diagnostic workup and to explore demographic factors associated with diagnosis timeliness.<h4>Methods</h4>NYC Health + Hospitals is the municipal safety net health system in New York City. Before the SCI, there was no process for tracking and triaging patients with suspected cancer. We implemented the SCI across four components: (1) an EMR referral flag within the physician workflow, (2) referral guidelines embedded into the EMR, (3) a dashboard to track metrics, and (4) a steering committee with specialty leaders. The primary outcomes measured were time from referral to (1) specialty appointment scheduling, (2) specialty appointment, (3) biopsy, and (4) diagnosis.<h4>Results</h4>The manuscript analyzes data from 6,087 patients referred through the SCI. In all, 61.1% of patients were female and 41.5% were age ≥65 years. In total, 40.3% were Hispanic, 36.8% were African American, and 57.1% spoke English. Compared with the first month of implementation, we saw a 56.6% improvement (10.9 days) in time from referral to specialty appointment scheduling, a 57.2% improvement (31.2 days) in time from referral to specialty appointment, a 69.6% improvement (80.9 days) in time from referral to biopsy, and a 68.2% improvement (63 days) in time from referral to diagnosis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Prioritizing patients with suspected cancer using a multipronged approach improved the timeliness of care. An SCI was implemented using existing resources and served as a cost-effective way to improve care for high-risk patients.",Thompson S; O'Neill E; Shen D; O'Callaghan S; Teckie S,"New York City Health + Hospitals, New York, NY.",JCO oncology practice,2026-01-23,10.1200/op-25-00805,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
41573358,Development and application of a clinical nursing decision support system for pressure injury in postoperative cardiac surgery patients.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To develop a clinical nursing decision support system for pressure injury and explore its application in managing pressure injury in postoperative cardiac surgery patients.<h4>Methods</h4>A multidisciplinary research team was formed to develop a clinical nursing decision support system. Key indicators, including wound assessment accuracy, wound treatment accuracy, pressure injury healing rate, pressure injury incidence, and defect rates in nursing records, were compared before and after the clinical nursing decision support system utilization. Count data were described using frequency and composition ratio (%), and comparisons were made using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact probability method. Measurement data following a normal distribution were described by mean and standard deviation, while non-normally distributed data were described by median and interquartile range. Independent sample t-tests and rank-sum tests were used for between-group comparisons. A significance level of α = 0.05 was set, with results considered statistically significant if P < 0.05.<h4>Results</h4>The clinical nursing decision support system implements an intelligent decision-making engine and interactive dashboard for human-computer interaction, enabling intelligent assessment and decision-making, re-evaluation reminders, interactive modules, intelligent auditing, and a three-level quality control system for pressure injury. After applying the clinical nursing decision support system, the pressure injury incidence in postoperative cardiac surgery patients decreased from 14.8% to 12.8%, with no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). The pressure injury healing rate increased from 89.1% to 97.2%, wound assessment accuracy improved from 90.8% to 97.2%, and wound treatment accuracy increased from 88.3% to 96.5%. The defect rate in nursing records decreased from 15.3% to 7.7%, with all differences being statistically significant (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study successfully developed and implemented a clinical nursing decision support system for pressure injury management in postoperative cardiac surgery patients. These results confirm the system's clinical utility in standardizing pressure injury care, optimizing nursing workflows, and elevating documentation quality. The clinical nursing decision support system provides an effective tool for enabling evidence-based, personalized interventions and strengthening closed-loop quality control in pressure injury management.",Zhang N; Meng Z; Xu L; Zhang Y; Wu Z; Fa T,"Department of Nursing, Tianjin Chest Hospital, Tianjin, China.",Digital health,2026-01-20,10.1177/20552076251411638,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Thoracic Surgery; Hospital Information System; Pressure Injury; Clinical Nursing Decision Support System
