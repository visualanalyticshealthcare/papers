40397928,"Design, Application, and Actionability of US Public Health Data Dashboards: Scoping Review.","<h4>Background</h4>Data dashboards can be a powerful tool for ensuring access for public health decision makers to timely, relevant, and credible data. As their appeal and reach become ubiquitous, it is important to consider how they may be best integrated with public health data systems and the decision-making routines of users.<h4>Objective</h4>This scoping review describes and analyzes the current state of knowledge regarding the design, application, and actionability of US national public health data dashboards to identify critical theoretical and empirical gaps in the literature and clarify definitions and operationalization of actionability as a critical property of dashboards.<h4>Methods</h4>The review follows PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. A search was conducted for refereed journal articles, conference proceedings, and reports that describe the design, implementation, or evaluation of US national public health dashboards published between 2000 and 2023, using a validated search query across relevant databases (CINAHL, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) and gray literature sources. Of 2544 documents retrieved, 89 (3.5%) met all inclusion criteria. An iterative process of testing and improving intercoder reliability was implemented to extract data.<h4>Results</h4>The dashboards reviewed (N=89) target a broad range of public health topics but are primarily designed for epidemiological surveillance and monitoring (n=51, 57% of dashboards) and probing health disparities and social determinants of health (n=27, 30%). Thus, they are limited in their potential to guide users' policy and practice decisions. Nearly all dashboards are created, hosted, and funded by institutional entities, such as government agencies and universities, that hold influence over public health agendas and priorities. Intended users are primarily public health professionals (n=34, 38%), policy makers (n=30, 34%), and researchers or practitioners (n=28, 32%), but it is unclear whether the dashboards are tailored to users' data capacities or needs, although 30% of articles reference user-centered design. Usability indicators commonly referenced include website analytics (n=22, 25%), expert evaluation (n=19, 21%), and users' impact stories (n=14, 16%), but only 30% (n=26) of all articles report usability assessment. Usefulness is frequently inferred from presumed relevance to decision makers (n=17, 19%), anecdotal stakeholder feedback (n=16, 18%), and user engagement metrics (n=14, 16%) rather than via rigorous testing. Only 47% (n=42) of dashboards were still accessible or active at the time of review.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings reveal fragmentation and a lack of scientific rigor in current knowledge regarding the design, implementation, and utility of public health dashboards. Coherent theoretical accounts and direct empirical tests that link usability, usefulness, and use of these tools to users' decisions and actions are critically missing. A more complete explication and operationalization of actionability in this context has significant potential to fill this gap and advance future scholarship and practice.",Stahlman G; Yanovitzky I; Kim M,"School of Information, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, United States.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-05-21,10.2196/65283,8.2,"dashboard(kw,title,abstract); data(title,abstract)",Development; Evaluation; Design; Implementation; Public Health; Prisma; Scoping Review; Dashboard; User Need
40402556,Application of Machine Learning and Emerging Health Technologies in the Uptake of HIV Testing: Bibliometric Analysis of Studies Published From 2000 to 2024.,"<h4>Background</h4>The global targets for HIV testing for achieving the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 95-95-95 targets are still short. Identifying gaps and opportunities for HIV testing uptake is crucial in fast-tracking the second (initiate people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy) and third (viral suppression) UNAIDS goals. Machine learning and health technologies can precisely predict high-risk individuals and facilitate more effective and efficient HIV testing methods. Despite this advancement, there exists a research gap regarding the extent to which such technologies are integrated into HIV testing strategies worldwide.<h4>Objective</h4>The study aimed to examine the characteristics, citation patterns, and contents of published studies applying machine learning and emerging health technologies in HIV testing from 2000 to 2024.<h4>Methods</h4>This bibliometric analysis identified relevant studies using machine learning and emerging health technologies in HIV testing from the Web of Science database using synonymous keywords. The Bibliometrix R package was used to analyze the characteristics, citation patterns, and contents of 266 articles. The VOSviewer software was used to conduct network visualization. The analysis focused on the yearly growth rate, citation analysis, keywords, institutions, countries, authorship, and collaboration patterns. Key themes and topics were driven by the authors' most frequent keywords, which aided the content analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis revealed a scientific annual growth rate of 15.68%, with an international coauthorship of 8.22% and an average citation count of 17.47 per document. The most relevant sources were from high-impact journals such as the Journal of Internet Medicine Research, JMIR mHealth and uHealth, JMIR Research Protocols, mHealth, AIDS Care-Psychological and Socio-Medical Aspects of AI, and BMC Public Health, and PLOS One. The United States of America, China, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Australia produced the highest number of contributions. Collaboration analysis showed significant networks among universities in high-income countries, including the University of North Carolina, Emory University, the University of Michigan, San Diego State University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The discrepancy highlights missed opportunities in strategic partnerships between high-income and low-income countries. The results further demonstrate that machine learning and health technologies enhance the effective and efficient implementation of innovative HIV testing methods, including HIV self-testing among priority populations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identifies trends and hotspots of machine learning and health technology research in relation to HIV testing across various countries, institutions, journals, and authors. The trends are higher in high-income countries with a greater focus on technology applications for HIV self-testing among young people and priority populations.

40388152,Artificial intelligence based pulmonary vessel segmentation: an opportunity for automated three-dimensional planning of lung segmentectomy.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to develop an automated method for pulmonary artery and vein segmentation in both left and right lungs from computed tomography (CT) images using artificial intelligence (AI). The segmentations were evaluated using PulmoSR software, which provides 3D visualizations of patient-specific anatomy, potentially enhancing a surgeon's understanding of the lung structure.<h4>Methods</h4>A dataset of 125 CT scans from lung segmentectomy patients at Erasmus MC was used. Manual annotations for pulmonary arteries and veins were created with 3D Slicer. nnU-Net models were trained for both lungs, assessed using Dice score, sensitivity, and specificity. Intraoperative recordings demonstrated clinical applicability. A paired t-test evaluated statistical significance of the differences between automatic and manual segmentations.<h4>Results</h4>The nnU-Net model, trained at full 3D resolution, achieved a mean Dice score between 0.91 and 0.92. The mean sensitivity and specificity were: left artery: 0.86 and 0.99, right artery: 0.84 and 0.99, left vein: 0.85 and 0.99, right vein: 0.85 and 0.99. The automatic method reduced segmentation time from ∼1.5 hours to under 5 min. Five cases were evaluated to demonstrate how the segmentations support lung segmentectomy procedures. P-values for Dice scores were all below 0.01, indicating statistical significance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The nnU-Net models successfully performed automatic segmentation of pulmonary arteries and veins in both lungs. When integrated with visualization tools, these automatic segmentations can enhance preoperative and intraoperative planning by providing detailed 3D views of patients anatomy.",Mank QJ; Thabit A; Maat APWM; Siregar S; Van Walsum T; Kluin J; Sadeghi AH,"Department of Cardiothoracic surgery, Thoraxcenter, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",Interdisciplinary cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,2025-05-19,10.1093/icvts/ivaf101,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Pulmonary vessels; Cardiothoracic Surgery; Lung Segmentectomy; Artificial Intelligence (Ai); Deep Learning (Dl)
40392326,A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the association between atopic dermatitis and depression (1994-2024).,"In recent decades, the prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) has dramatically risen due to modern environmental exposures and drastic lifestyle changes. Furthermore, many studies emphasize that the prevalence of mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, is much higher among patients with AD compared to the general population. Consequently, there is an urgent imperative to delve into emerging research trends and focal points concerning the association between AD and depression. By analyzing the literature on the correlation between AD and Depression in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) over the past three decades, our study aims to investigate the key research areas and trends related to the connection between AD and depression through bibliometric analysis, offering useful insights for future researchers in this area. Publications from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2024, were retrieved from WoSCC on January 5, 2025, and visualized with Excel and Vosviewer software. Summing up to 729 papers were included, authored by 3,670 individuals. The United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom were prominent in researching the link between AD and depression, with the US publishing the highest number of papers-216 in total. Jonathan I. Silverberg stood out as the most prolific author in this field. Keywords visualization analysis revealed that ""atopic dermatitis"" and ""depression"" were core topics. It is noteworthy that there has been a significant evolution in research emphasis over time, with studies of AD associated with depression moving from early ""pruritus"" ""psoriasis"", and ""stress"" studies, gradually transitioning into the field of adolescent mental health, suggesting that society's interest in dermatologic conditions and their psychological impact is gradually extending from purely physical symptoms to the broader implications of mental health and quality of life. A thorough bibliometric analysis was initially performed to outline the current state and knowledge framework of the connection between AD and depression, aiming to offer guidance and new insights for future research in this area.",Yang Y; Li JX; Wang ZL; Zhu SE; Xie JZ,"Guangdong Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Foshan, 528200, China.",Archives of dermatological research,2025-05-20,10.1007/s00403-025-04269-w,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Depression; Visualization; bibliometrics; Atopic Dermatitis; Vosviewer; Hotspots
40395153,Engineering Bacterial Secretion Systems for Enhanced Tumor Imaging and Surgical Guidance.,"Current imaging techniques suffer from a lack of specificity and resolution, leading to inaccurate tumor imaging and limited applicability of targeted contrast agents, as they require cancer-specific development. The need for enhanced contrast through improved tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) and the toxicity from repeated injections due to fading fluorescent signals further complicate the issue. Additionally, challenges in visualizing the entire 3D tumor with surface-stained contrast agents highlight the demand for advanced imaging solutions for more precise surgical guidance. A novel approach is proposed utilizing Streptavidin Associated Salmonella (SAS) as a contrast agent for image-guided surgeries. SAS selectively proliferates in cancerous tissues and secretes streptavidin upon induction, enabling the binding of subsequently injected biotin-conjugated fluorescent dyes. This approach enhances tumor visualization with a TBR of up to 15.3, far surpassing conventional agents (TBR ∼ 2), while enabling prolonged 3-day imaging, deep tumor penetration, and precise invasive margin delineation with a single contrast agent injection. Furthermore, biosafety evaluations confirmed efficient bacterial clearance, absence of systemic toxicity, and stable physiological responses, supporting its potential for safe clinical translation. This innovative method offers substantial improvements over existing fluorescent contrast agents and holds promise for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer surgery.",Lee D; Jeon HJ; Jang D; Lee D; Kim S; Han M; Jung SJ; Lee J; Choi J; Kim DH; Ahn DJ; Kim K; Kim S; Lee HJ; Suh S,"Bionics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, 02792, Republic of Korea.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2025-05-21,10.1002/adma.202504389,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Surgical Guidance; Fluorescent Contrast Agents; Bacteria‐based Tumor Visualization; Fluorescence Image‐guided Surgery; Streptavidin‐associated Salmonella (Sas)
40383771,Pioneering evaluation in Brazil of microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography with a three-dimensional digital visualization system during pars plana vitrectomy for the treatment of macular hole.,"<h4>Background</h4>This study aimed to characterize the clinical results and usability of intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) associated with a digital visualization system in vitreoretinal surgery for macular hole correction.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a descriptive observational study of patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery for macular hole at Brazilian Eye Surgery Center in which the digital visualization system associated with iOCT was used. Anatomical and functional results were collected 6 months after surgery. Macular hole closure rates, pre- and post-operative visual acuity were measured in addition to surgeon feedback and the percentage in which the technology allowed intraoperative decision-making.<h4>Results</h4>25 eyes of 25 patients were included in the study. The mean preoperative visual acuity was 20/100, ranging from 20/50 to less than 20/400, and postoperative visual acuity was 20/60, ranging from 20/25 to less than 20/400. The time spent with iOCT did not result in surgical delay, as the average time spent was 3.24 extra minutes spent per surgery. Closure of the macular hole was achieved successfully in 92% of cases. In 8% of them surgical success in closing the macular hole was achieved after a new fluid-gas exchange in the office. The surgeon preferred real-time iOCT and, in 4% (1/25) of cases, it influenced the change in surgical technique, preventing unnecessary ILM (Internal Limiting Membrane) peeling after complete removal of the posterior hyaloid and closing the macular hole. In all cases the surgeon reported valid feedback regarding the use of information provided by real-time OCT. This tool was valid for confirming complete ILM peeling in all cases in which it was performed. Finally, iOCT made it possible to identify the appropriate location to begin creating the ILM flap in 2 cases (8%) both of fragile retina; It prevented a new injection of dyes to identify residual ILM in 8% of cases (2/25) and allowed verification of the correct positioning of the pedicled ILM flap over the hole in 16% (4/25) of cases. Therefore, in 36% of cases (9/25) iOCT was essential for the final surgical outcome.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study suggests that the use of iOCT integrated with a digital viewing microscope for the treatment of macular holes offers high standard usability and effectiveness for visualizing structures, and impact favorably on decision-making process during pars-plana vitrectomy. These findings suggest that in the near future, expanded use of iOCT could significantly improve tissue management at the vitreomacular interface and improve anatomical and functional results.",de Freitas LP; Neto JM; Neves LL; Bastos T; Pires ACF; Casella AMB; Isaac DLC; de Ávila MP,"Ophthalmology Reference Center at the Federal University of Goiás, Goiânia, Go, 74605-020, Brazil. pfreitas.lele@gmail.com.",International journal of retina and vitreous,2025-05-19,10.1186/s40942-025-00671-8,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Vitrectomy; Macular Hole; Ilm Peeling; Ioct
40394594,Rapid visual detection of Monkeypox virus by one-step LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12b assay.,"<h4>Background</h4>Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection has garnered significant global attention due to its rising incidence and substantial public health implications. A rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnostic method is urgently required to enable early intervention and effective management of MPXV outbreaks.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we developed a novel one-step assay that integrates loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with CRISPR/Cas12b in one-pot for the detection of MPXV. The entire detection process did not require opening the lid of the reaction tube and could be completed within 40 min using extracted viral nucleic acids, which is faster than real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). And the results could be interpreted through either real-time fluorescence or naked-eye visualization. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was demonstrated to be 6.5 copies per reaction and no cross-reactivity with other pathogens such as HSV, EBV, CVA16, EV-A71, and MV was found. Furthermore, when evaluated using 113 clinical samples, the assay achieved 100% sensitivity (71/71) and 100% specificity (42/42) compared to the qPCR.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In resource-limited settings, our method requires only a portable heat block or water bath and a blue light or ultraviolet flashlight for visual detection of MPXV, making it highly accessible. The integration of LAMP and CRISPR/Cas12b provides a robust, user-friendly platform for point-of-care testing, with promising potential for the rapid molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases.",Guo J; Shan Y; Hu G; Zhu X; Zhao K; Wu T; Qiao Q; Chi Y; Cui L; Ge Y,"NHC Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Medical Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology in Emerging Major Infectious Diseases, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, 210009, China.",Virology journal,2025-05-20,10.1186/s12985-025-02780-0,6.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract)",Point-of-care Testing; Visual Detection; Monkeypox Virus; Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification; One-step; Crispr/cas12b
40405782,Development and application of an intelligent platform for automated recognition of surgical instruments in laparoscopic procedures: a multicenter retrospective study [experimental studies].,"<h4>Background</h4>Surgical videos offer rich intraoperative data critical for surgical education, quality control, and skill assessment. However, their increasing volume and complexity render manual review impractical. To address this challenge, this study aims to develop an intelligent platform capable of automatically recognizing and visualizing intraoperative surgical instrument usage, and to evaluate its clinical utility in real-world surgical settings.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Surgical videos from 21 medical centers in China, covering five surgical types, were collected to develop a generalized artificial intelligence (AI) model for automated surgical instrument recognition. The model was deployed on the SurgSmart platform which features clinically oriented functions. A multicenter survey involving 30 surgeons was conducted to assess the clinical value of the platform.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1,261 surgical videos were collected, from which 96,324 images were extracted and annotated with 268,828 labels. The developed model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 80.31% for recognizing 21 surgical instruments. Based on this model, four core functions were implemented on SurgSmart: Rapid Review Mode, Surgical Instrument Report, Surgical Instrument Heatmap, and Surgical Teaching Mode. All participating surgeons reported a high level of satisfaction and acknowledged the clinical relevance of these functionalities.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A universally applicable surgical instrument recognition model was developed and deployed on SurgSmart to enable the visualization of intraoperative instrument usage, demonstrating promising clinical potential for automated surgical video analysis and enhanced intraoperative data interpretation.",Hu R; Tang M; Jin Y; Xiang L; Li K; Peng B; Liu J; Qin D; Liang L; Li Y; Liu L; Wang C; Xiong Y; Dai P; Li A; Wang X,"Department of General Surgery, Division of Pancreatic Surgery, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",2025-05-23,10.1097/js9.0000000000002562,6.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Laparoscopic Procedures; Video-based Assessment; Surgical Instrument Recognition; Intelligent Surgical Platform
40391505,Feasibility of an AI-driven Classification of Tuberous Breast Deformity: A Siamese Network Approach with a Continuous Tuberosity Score.,"<h4>Background</h4>Tuberous breast deformity (TBD) is a congenital condition characterized by constriction of the breast base, parenchymal hypoplasia, and areolar herniation. The absence of a universally accepted classification system complicates diagnosis and surgical planning, leading to variability in clinical outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful adjunct in medical imaging, enabling objective, reproducible, and data-driven diagnostic assessments.<h4>Objectives</h4>This study introduces an AI-driven diagnostic tool for tuberous breast deformity (TBD) classification using a Siamese Network trained on paired frontal and lateral images. Additionally, the model generates a continuous Tuberosity Score (ranging from 0 to 1) based on embedding vector distances, offering an objective measure to enhance surgical planning and improved clinical outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>A dataset of 200 expertly classified frontal and lateral breast images (100 tuberous, 100 non-tuberous) was used to train a Siamese Network with contrastive loss. The model extracted high-dimensional feature embeddings to differentiate tuberous from non-tuberous breasts. Five-fold cross-validation ensured robust performance evaluation. Performance metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualization techniques, such as t-SNE clustering and occlusion sensitivity mapping, were employed to interpret model decisions.<h4>Results</h4>The model achieved an average accuracy of 96.2% ± 5.5%, with balanced precision and recall. The Tuberosity Score, derived from the Euclidean distance between embeddings, provided a continuous measure of deformity severity, correlating well with clinical assessments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This AI-based framework offers an objective, high-accuracy classification system for TBD. The Tuberosity Score enhances diagnostic precision, potentially aiding in surgical planning and improving patient outcomes.",Vaccari S; Paderno A; Furlan S; Cavallero MF; Lupacchini AM; Di Giuli R; Klinger M; Klinger F; Vinci V,"Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine BIOMETRA, Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Plastic Surgery School, Università degli Studi Di Milano, Milan, Italy.",Aesthetic surgery journal,2025-05-20,10.1093/asj/sjaf090,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); data(abstract),

The final application was validated by experts (<i>n</i> = 7), tested for usability by ALS patients and caregivers (<i>n</i> = 18), and evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS) to assess effectiveness and user satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>The application includes features such as tailored health data visualization, symptom tracking, text-to-speech functionality, and access to information customized based on the overall the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised score, thereby supporting patient-centered care and daily disease management. The mean SUS score was 75.00 ± 9.57 for expert panel members and 63.75 ± 10.26 for the target users, indicating an acceptable level of usability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The mobile application was evaluated as practical, acceptable, and feasible for ALS patients and their caregivers, with positive feedback on its usability and potential to improve self-care management.",Oh J; Chu HS,"College of Nursing, Dankook University, Cheonan-si, Korea.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2025-05-20,10.1080/21678421.2025.2507169,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Supportive Care; Self-care; Mobile App
40406803,Mapping of care pathways in pediatric and adult palliative care in Spain: A case study.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to map the actual care pathways for pediatric and adult palliative care (PC) patients at a hospital in the Region of Murcia (Spain) utilizing Process Mining (PM) techniques. The goal was to identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement in providing comprehensive and coordinated care to enhance patient outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective review of anonymized clinical records was conducted, covering data from 2002 to 2021 for adult patients and from 2001 to 2021 for pediatric patients. The final dataset for adults comprised records from 85 patients and 2,696 episodes, and, for pediatric patients, the dataset included 57 individuals with 1,912 episodes. PM techniques (concretely, PMApp) facilitated the visualization and evaluation of actual care pathways, compared to theoretical models, highlighting bottlenecks and variabilities.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis revealed distinct care pathways for adult and pediatric patients. Pediatric pathways showed inconsistencies with theoretical models due to variability in diseases and care needs, while adult pathways aligned better with expectations. Key inefficiencies included delays in shifting to home care and multiple visits to the hospital Emergency Department before referral to specialized teams. Simplified process models provided clearer insights into frequent care pathways and highlighted critical transition points, supporting optimization strategies.<h4>Significance of results</h4>The findings underscore the utility of PM in enhancing care pathway transparency, identifying inefficiencies, and supporting data-driven process redesign. The study advocates for updating theoretical models and adopting structured data collection to reduce variability and improve PC delivery.

40399896,Epidemiology of hepatitis B and C among risk groups in Czechia.,"Hepatitis B (VHB) and C (VHC) are significant global public health issues, particularly for certain risk groups. In the Czech Republic, individuals who inject drugs (IDUs), incarcerated people, and those with high-risk sexual behaviours are especially susceptible. This research investigates the epidemiology, risk factors, and effects of both diseases on these groups. It analyzes the incidence of VHB and VHC in Czechia over the last twenty years in the post-vaccine era, compares their occurrence, and identifies factors influencing their rates. A total of 28,160 VHB and VHC cases reported in the Czech Republic from 2000 to 2021 were analyzed, categorized into acute and chronic forms. Specifically, there were 8,762 cases of VHB and 19,398 cases of VHC. The research employed quantitative methods and descriptive data analysis. A spatial visualization of disease occurrence per 100,000 inhabitants in Czech districts was conducted for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 to compare disease development and the risk group of IDUs across districts. For VHB, transmission primarily occurs through intravenous drug use or risky sexual behaviour, with IDUs, men who have sex with men, and promiscuous individuals being the most at-risk groups. For VHC, sexual transmission is less common, with IDUs being the most at-risk group. Many VHC cases have been recorded in prisons, often due to shared razors or amateur tattooing and piercing. This discovery underscores the necessity for focused interventions and thorough strategies to address both diseases in high-risk communities.",Bendlova I; Simka V; Ryzhova E; Schovankova T; Holy O,"Science and Research Centre, Faculty of Health Sciences, Palacký University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czechia.",BMC public health,2025-05-21,10.1186/s12889-025-23014-6,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),epidemiology; Risk Groups; Vhb – Viral Hepatitis B; Vhc – Viral Hepatitis C
40387116,Quantitative Perfusion Assessment Using Indocyanine Green in Lower Extremity Perforator Flaps.,"BackgroundIndocyanine-Green Fluorescence Angiography (ICG-FA) is widely used in reconstructive surgery, providing real-time visualization of flap perfusion. Accurate assessment of perfusion is especially critical in lower extremity reconstructions, where complications like necrosis and venous congestion can lead to poor outcomes, including amputation. Although ICG-FA is commonly available, its interpretation remains subjective and heavily reliant on the surgeon's experience. These challenges underline the importance of integrating objective, data-driven assessment tools into surgical practice.MethodsAs part of a larger, ongoing prospective study, three illustrative cases of lower extremity reconstructions using perforator-based fasciocutaneous flaps were selected. Intraoperative ICG-FA was performed using a surgical microscope with integrated fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence-time-curves (FTCs) were generated using specialized software, and associated quantitative perfusion parameters were compared across three cases: two patients with perfusion-related complications and one patient without complications.ResultsIntraoperative clinical assessment appeared satisfactory in all cases, and no changes in surgical management were made based on the subjective interpretation of ICG-FA. In contrast, quantitative analysis of ICG-FA revealed abnormal perfusion patterns in the two flaps that developed complications, identifying perfusion deficits not evident through conventional assessment.ConclusionThese findings suggest that FTCs derived from ICG-FA data can predict perfusion-related complications. Integrating quantitative ICG-FA analysis into clinical practice may yield a significant advancement in reconstructive surgery, especially in lower extremity reconstructions.Clinical trial nameICG Indocyanine Green in Reconstructive Surgery (ICG-R).ClinicalTrials.gov IDNCT06129669 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06129669?cond=NCT06129669&rank=1).",Van 't Hof LWP; Koster ITS; Van den Elzen RM; Bouman MB; Botman M; Driessen C,"Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand surgery, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",Surgical innovation,2025-05-19,10.1177/15533506251339929,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),fluorescence imaging; Indocyanine green; Lower Extremity Reconstruction
40407003,Recent advances in multimodality imaging-guided therapy in pericarditis.,"<h4>Background</h4>In the era of precision medicine, cardiac multimodality imaging plays a vital role in diagnosing, managing, and monitoring pericarditis. This condition, often marked by inflammation and recurrent episodes, requires precise imaging techniques to guide diagnosis and therapeutic decisions.<h4>Methods</h4>We carefully reviewed the medical literature for high-quality data regarding the use of multimodality imaging in pericarditis and the precious value of the novel concept of imaging-guided therapy.<h4>Results</h4>While echocardiography remains the cornerstone for detecting pericardial effusion and evaluating hemodynamics, its limited ability to characterize inflammation has driven the use of advanced modalities such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), cardiac computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET). CMR offers superior visualization of pericardial inflammation through late gadolinium enhancement, aiding in identifying patients who may benefit from targeted anti-inflammatory therapies. CT imaging, with its high spatial resolution, aids in detecting pericardial calcifications and thickening, particularly in constrictive pericarditis. PET, often combined with CT, is a valuable tool for quantifying metabolic activity, allowing the detection of active inflammation, particularly in complex or refractory cases. Multiple imaging targets have been identified as essential biomarkers to confirm the inflammatory phenotype, assess treatment response, and monitor for complications.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Considering the inherent limitations of each imaging modality, the integration of imaging findings with clinical and biomarker data may aid clinicians in tailoring therapy according to different clinical scenarios and better stratification of patients who may benefit from IL-1 blockade.

40396235,A Novel Noninvasive Approach for Evaluating Suspicious Cervical Lymph Nodes in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma-Superb Microvascular Imaging.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To assess the diagnostic performance of superb microvascular imaging (SMI) versus color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and fine-needle aspiration thyroglobulin (FNA-Tg) in detecting indeterminate cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients.<h4>Methods</h4>We prospectively analyzed clinical and imaging data from 74 PTC patients with indeterminate CLNs undergoing FNA biopsy and Tg measurement. Analyses included: (1) univariate comparison of benign versus malignant CLNs; (2) Spearman correlation between imaging features and pathological findings; and (3) receiver operating characteristic curve assessment of diagnostic accuracy.<h4>Results</h4>Among 43 benign and 31 malignant CLNs, significant differences were observed in gender (p = 0.026), age (p = 0.041), FNA-Tg levels (p < 0.001), and diagnostic outcomes for CDFI (p = 0.001) and SMI (p < 0.001). FNA-Tg (r = 0.946), SMI (r = 0.707), and CDFI (r = 0.403) correlated with pathology (all p < 0.001). FNA-Tg showed superior accuracy (AUC = 0.977) versus SMI (AUC = 0.856) and CDFI (AUC = 0.704). SMI detected more vessels than CDFI in benign (2.00 vs. 1.00) and malignant nodes (3.00 vs. 2.00) (p < 0.001), with higher overall counts (2.53 ± 1.47 vs. 1.50 ± 1.13, p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>SMI outperformed CDFI in microvascular visualization for indeterminate CLNs in PTC. Although FNA-Tg remained the most accurate diagnostic method, SMI served as a valuable noninvasive alternative, especially when FNA-Tg was contraindicated or inaccessible.",Xu LL; Zhou L; Yu XL; Li SY,"Department of Ultrasound in Medicine, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.",Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,2025-05-21,10.1002/jcu.24087,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Color Doppler flow imaging; Diagnostic Accuracy; Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis; Superb Microvascular Imaging; Fine‐needle Aspiration Thyroglobulin
40398835,The relevance of intraoral scanner (IOS) for periodontal diagnosis: a scoping review.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The aim of this scoping review was to map the literature on the application and relevance of intraoral scanners (IOS) in periodontal diagnosis.<h4>Data</h4>Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, and the protocol was registered on the PROSPERO platform under identification number CRD42024541948.<h4>Sources</h4>An electronic search covering the past 10 years was conducted in the PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases in September 2023 and updated on September 30 2024.<h4>Study selection</h4>The search identified 524 articles, of which 52 were included in the review. These studies, with varying levels of evidence (6 RCTs, 21 interventional studies, 10 cross-sectional studies, 2 retrospective studies, and 13 case reports) covered various applications of IOS for periodontal diagnosis, including exclusive use in periodontology as well as the transversal application of IOS in other dental disciplines. The TRIOS camera was the most common type of IOS in the studies, featuring in 54% of publications. Intraoral scanners were found to be highly accurate in measuring gingival thickness, when combined with CBCT, and keratinized tissue height. According to the studies, plaque detection and probing depth were evaluated with limited success due to examination bias. Software analysis enhanced the interpretation of IOS data, although limitations related to scanning protocols and the visualization of posterior and proximal areas were noted.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Within the limitations of this scoping review, IOS represents a promising approach in the field of periodontology. As technological advancements continue, IOS should play an increasingly significant role in diagnostic procedures.

40404752,Analysis of associated factors affecting hematoma evacuation rates in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage with stereotactic aspiration combined with catheter drainage.,"Due to the absence of direct visualization during the operative field in stereotactic surgery for sICH, there exists individual variability in hematoma evacuation (HE) rates, with about 42% of patients not attaining the expected threshold for HE. The aim of this study was to find the relevant factors affecting HE during the treatment of sICH with stereotactic surgery. We pooled individual data from our prospective ICH database, encompassing patients who underwent stereotactic aspiration and catheter drainage. The primary outcome was HE rates prior to extubation. Multivariate logistic regression using the stepwise forward method to identify the independent risk factors. A predictive scoring model was developed based on regression coefficients. To evaluate its discrimination performance, we conducted ROC curve analysis and calculated the AUC. Additionally, we employed calibration curves as an indicator of concordance. The bootstrap internal validation was used to ascertain the model's stability. DCA was performed to determine the clinical utility. The study included 90 patients, of whom 43 (47.8%) patients achieved HE rates ≥ 70%. The multivariate logistic analysis showed that blend sign (OR 7.003, 95% CI 2.118-23.161, P = 0.001), irregular shape (OR 0.235, 95% CI 0.067-0.821, P = 0.023), two drainage tubes (OR 28.643, 95% CI 1.872-438.181, P = 0.016), diabetes (OR 0.078, 95% CI 0.006-0.948, P = 0.045), and hematoma edge linked to ventricle (OR 0.145, 95% CI 0.032-0.659, P = 0.012) were independent risk factors. For clinical use, the Model-score was established, with a total score ranging from -6 to 5. The AUC values of the Model-logit and Model-score were 0.820 (95% CI 0.733-0.906) and 0.822 (95% CI 0.737-0.908) respectively. The cutoff values were 0.275 and -0.5. Calibration curves demonstrated excellent agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes in both models. Utilizing the bootstrap method for internal validation, the mean AUC values were determined to be 0.819 (95% CI 0.736-0.903) for Model-logit and 0.823 (95% CI 0.742-0.903) for Model-score, demonstrating stability across the resampled datasets. The DCA confirmed that both models provide superior net benefit for predicting HE rates ≥ 70% when the individualized threshold ranges from 10 to 82%. The predictive model of HE rates ≥ 70% prior to extuation has demonstrated predictive capability, holds the potential to assist clinicians in optimizing surgical efficiency.",Luo X; Song K; Zhuo L; Lin F; Gao Z; He Q; Zheng Y; Lian K; Shangguan H; Luo X; Lin Y; Kang D; Fang W,"Department of Neurosurgery, Neurosurgery Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, No. 20 Chazhong Road, Taijiang District, Fuzhou, 350005, Fujian, China.",Scientific reports,2025-05-22,10.1038/s41598-025-01754-0,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Predictive model; Stereotactic Aspiration; Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage; Blend Sign; Hematoma Evacuation Rates
40408875,Automated ventricular segmentation in pediatric hydrocephalus: how close are we?,"<h4>Objective</h4>The explosive growth of available high-quality imaging data coupled with new progress in hardware capabilities has enabled a new era of unprecedented performance in brain segmentation tasks. Despite the explosion of new data released by consortiums and groups around the world, most published, closed, or openly available segmentation models have either a limited or an unknown role in pediatric brains. This study explores the utility of state-of-the-art automated ventricular segmentation tools applied to pediatric hydrocephalus. Two popular, fast, whole-brain segmentation tools were used (FastSurfer and QuickNAT) to automatically segment the lateral ventricles and evaluate their accuracy in children with hydrocephalus.<h4>Methods</h4>Forty scans from 32 patients were included in this study. The patients underwent imaging at the University of Minnesota Medical Center or satellite clinics, were between 0 and 18 years old, had an ICD-10 diagnosis that included the word hydrocephalus, and had at least one T1-weighted pre- or postcontrast MPRAGE sequence. Patients with poor quality scans were excluded. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) scores were used to compare segmentation outputs against manually segmented lateral ventricles.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, both models performed poorly with DSCs of 0.61 for each segmentation tool. No statistically significant difference was noted between model performance (p = 0.86). Using a multivariate linear regression to examine factors associated with higher DSC performance, male gender (p = 0.66), presence of ventricular catheter (p = 0.72), and MRI magnet strength (p = 0.23) were not statistically significant factors. However, younger age (p = 0.03) and larger ventricular volumes (p = 0.01) were significantly associated with lower DSC values. A large-scale visualization of 196 scans in both models showed characteristic patterns of segmentation failure in larger ventricles.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Significant gaps exist in current cutting-edge segmentation models when applied to pediatric hydrocephalus. Researchers will need to address these types of gaps in performance through thoughtful consideration of their training data before reaching the ultimate goal of clinical deployment.",Taha BR; Luo G; Naik A; Sabal L; Sun J; McGovern RA; Sandoval-Garcia C; Guillaume DJ,1Departments of Neurosurgery.,Journal of neurosurgery.

40411541,Advancing knee diagnostics and treatment: the role of needle arthroscopy.,"Knee needle arthroscopy (NA) represents a minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic approach for managing a variety of knee joint pathologies. This innovative technique, characterized by a thin, flexible, needle-like device, offers a less invasive alternative to conventional arthroscopy (CA), enabling outpatient procedures with reduced postoperative pain, faster recovery, and minimal scarring. This systematic review examines the current applications, diagnostic accuracy, clinical outcomes, and patient benefits of needle arthroscopy. Studies reveal that NA demonstrates comparable diagnostic efficacy to CA and superior accuracy to MRI for intra-articular knee pathology, particularly in meniscal injuries and anterior cruciate ligament assessments. NA facilitates real-time visualization and interventions under local anesthesia, promoting cost-efficiency and patient satisfaction. Despite its advantages, there are challenges such as limited visualization and technical proficiency. While NA emerges as a promising modality in knee diagnostics and treatment, further large-scale clinical trials are essential to validate its long-term efficacy, safety, and broader applications.",Compagnoni R; Pieroni A; Fedele G; Maione A; Calanna F; Ferrua P; Randelli PS,"Istituto Ortopedico Gaetano Pini, Milan, Italy.",Musculoskeletal surgery,2025-05-24,10.1007/s12306-025-00902-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Knee; Pain; Local anesthesia; Shoulder; Arthroscopy; Incision-less; Needle Arthroscopy
40409760,Teleneurosurgery between Greenland and Denmark.,"The Department of Neurosurgery at the University Hospital of Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet, provides tertiary care for patients from Greenland, where geographical remoteness and weather-related challenges often hinder timely access to neurosurgical interventions. This article presents a new initiative exploring the use of online supervision technology to facilitate neurosurgical care in remote settings. In 2024, a teleneurosurgical collaboration was launched between Queen Ingrid's Hospital in Nuuk, Greenland, and Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet. The program involved training local surgeons to perform cranial neurosurgical procedures using smart glasses, enabling real-time supervision from neurosurgeons in Copenhagen. In May 2024, the first patient was successfully operated on using this approach. Real-time visualization and interactive communication, including drawing and zooming features, allowed precise guidance and effective support. The integration of smart glass technology has the potential to enhance the safety of local neurosurgical care in Greenland and reduce the need for prolonged patient evacuation.

40410175,"inCu-click: DNA-enhanced ligand enables live-cell, intracellular click chemistry reaction with copper catalyst.","Labeling cellular biomolecules via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) offers rapid reaction kinetics and uses small azide and alkyne probes that minimally disturb molecular function, making it ideal for tracking biomolecules. However, applying CuAAC inside living cells has been hindered by the high copper levels required, which compromise cell health. To overcome this barrier, here, we develop inCu-click, an intracellular CuAAC approach that employs a DNA-conjugated ligand (BTT-DNA) to localize and concentrate copper ions at the reaction site. This design permits efficient click chemistry at low intracellular copper concentrations without added copper salts and supports template-driven proximity and liposomal delivery of the ligand into cells. Here we show that inCu-click enables robust fluorescent labeling of nascent phospholipids and proteins in live cells with negligible impact on viability, establishing a platform for real-time visualization of biomolecule dynamics in complex, live cell environments.",Nian K; Liu Y; Qiu Y; Zhang Z; Brigandi L; Wanunu M; Rouhanifard SH,"Dept. of Bioengineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.",Nature communications,2025-05-23,10.1038/s41467-025-60143-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

40408602,Biomimetic Flexible Capacitive Sensor with Loop Electrode and Snail Tentacle Structure for Enhanced Proximity and Pressure Sensing.,"Flexible electronics have garnered significant attention due to their promising applications in embodied intelligence, smart interaction, and human-machine interface (HMI). In particular, flexible sensors with a detectability of proximity and pressure hold great potential in areas such as touchless control, health monitoring, and robotic perception. Here, we present a biomimetic flexible capacitive sensor, called the loop electrode bioinspired snail tentacle sensor (LEBSTS). The loop-patterned electrode layer enhances proximity sensing via the fringing field effect, while the bioinspired snail tentacle-structured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) dielectric layer provides high sensitivity for pressure detection. The above design significantly improves sensing performance, achieving long-range proximity detection of 140 mm, a wide pressure-detection range from 0.9 Pa to 500 kPa, a high sensitivity of 2.844 kPa<sup>-1</sup> (0-1 kPa), and a fast response time of 87.5 ms. Moreover, the sensor demonstrates good durability, maintaining stable performance over 4500 cycles. Furthermore, the potential application of the sensor was explored, including human motion monitoring, touchless HMI, Morse code transmission via LoRa wireless communication, and pressure visualization systems.

40410108,Deep Learning Image Reconstruction (DLIR) Algorithm to Maintain High Image Quality and Diagnostic Accuracy in Quadruple-low CT Angiography of Children with Pulmonary Sequestration: A Case Control Study.,"<h4>Rationale and objectives</h4>CT angiography (CTA) is a commonly used clinical examination to detect abnormal arteries and diagnose pulmonary sequestration (PS). Reducing the radiation dose, contrast medium dosage, and injection pressure in CTA, especially in children, has always been an important research topic, but few research is proven by pathology. The current study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for children with PS in a quadruple-low CTA (4L-CTA: low tube voltage, radiation, contrast medium, and injection flow rate) using deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) in comparison with routine protocol CTA with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V (ASIR-V) MATERIALS AND METHODS: 53 patients (1.50±1.36years) suspected with PS were enrolled to undergo chest 4L-CTA using 70kVp tube voltage with radiation dose or 0.90 mGy in volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol) and contrast medium dose of 0.8 ml/kg injected in 16 s. Images were reconstructed using DLIR. Another 53 patients (1.25±1.02years) with a routine dose protocol was used for comparison, and images were reconstructed with ASIR-V. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and edge-rise distance (ERD) of the aorta were calculated. The subjective overall image quality and artery visualization were evaluated using a 5-point scale (5, excellent; 3, acceptable). All patients underwent surgery after CT, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing PS were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>4L-CTA reduced radiation dose by 51%, contrast dose by 47%, injection flow rate by 44% and injection pressure by 44% compared to the routine CTA (all p<0.05). Both groups had satisfactory subjective image quality and achieved 100% in both sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing PS. 4L-CTA had a reduced CNR (by 27%, p<0.05) but similar ERD, which reflects the image spatial resolution (p>0.05) compared to the routine CTA. 4L-CTA revealed small arteries with a diameter of 0.8 mm.<h4>Conclusion</h4>DLIR ensures the realization of 4L-CTA in children with PS for significant radiation and contrast dose reduction, while maintaining image quality, visualization of small arteries, and high diagnostic accuracy.",Li H; Zhang Y; Hua S; Sun R; Zhang Y; Yang Z; Peng Y; Sun J,"Department of radiology, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, No.56, Nanlishi Road, Xicheng District, Beijing 100045, China (H.L., Y.Z., R.S., Y.P., J.S.).

40388936,Rectal arterial embolization for hemostasis of acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcers: A case series.,"Acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer (AHRU), though a relatively rare etiology of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, represents a critical clinical emergency characterized by sudden onset, painless, massive, and fresh rectal bleeding. While endoscopic hemostasis remains prominent therapy, its efficacy is limited in emergency settings by poor bowel preparation and obscured visualization. Rectal arterial embolization (RAE) offers a viable alternative, however, detailed descriptions of its application for AHRU in literature are lacking. Thus, we report a single-center experience of RAE in six patients with massive AHRU-related bleeding. Technical success was achieved in 83% (5/6) of cases, with clinical success was achieved in 100% cases (6/6). Rebleeding after initial RAE procedure occurred in 33% (2/6) of cases, one of which ultimately achieving hemostasis through transanal suturing after initial embolization failure. No major embolism-related complications were observed during follow-up. Moreover, complete embolization of rectal supplies demonstrated potential to reduce rebleeding risk, and empiric embolization may hold promise for managing refractory AHRU hemorrhage. These findings advocate for RAE as an effective alternative for AHRU hemorrhage, though further validation in larger cohorts is essential.",Gu Y; Wu H; Tian W; Jiang H; Huang L; Liu H; Liao H; Meng X; Dong W,"Department of Interventional Radiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of the Naval Medical University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Shanghai, China.",Science progress,2025-05-19,10.1177/00368504251344186,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Rebleeding; Endoscopic Therapy; Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding; Acute Hemorrhagic Rectal Ulcer; Rectal Arterial Embolization

40411926,T1 and T2 signal appearance of different age stages of intracranial hemorrhage in post-mortem MRI.,"<h4>Background</h4>In forensic post-mortem medicine, intracranial hemorrhage is a relatively common and usually relevant finding. In recent years, the feasibility of post-mortem MRI (PMMR) for visualization of relevant intracranial findings, such as hemorrhage, has been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to investigate the PMMR T1 and T2 signal behavior of intracranial hemorrhages of different ages and the influence of post-mortem interval and degree of putrefaction on PMMR signal.<h4>Methods</h4>N = 200 forensic cases with natural and traumatic intracranial hemorrhages were examined in T1 and T2 weighted PMMR of the head. Hemorrhage age was determined based on police and/or medical case information and categorized into different age stages (hyperacute: < 12 hours; acute: 12-48 hours; early subacute: 2-7 days; late subacute: 7 days-1 month; chronic: > 1 month). T1w and T2w signal behavior was recorded and correlated according to the assessed individual age stages. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze whether signal behavior was influenced by the postmortem interval or the degree of putrefaction as assed by the radiological alteration index (RAI).<h4>Results</h4>In all age groups, predominant signal intensities were observed on both the T1 and T2 weighted images across all different hemorrhage types. The predominant PMMR signals corresponded to the known signal patterns of living patients in clinical MRI. However, deviations from the predominant signal intensity were observed in all age groups. The T1 and T2 signal characteristics of intracranial hemorrhage were not significantly influenced in cases with high RAI respectively advanced putrefaction.",Schreckenbauer L; Klaus J; Schwendener N; Fridle C; Hartmann C; Zech WD,"Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland.",Forensic science international,2025-05-19,10.1016/j.forsciint.2025.112506,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Brain; Intracranial Hemorrhage; Post-mortem Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Pmmr); Hemorrhage Age
40398682,Characterization of a nosocomial outbreak caused by VIM-1 Klebsiella michiganensis using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy.,"Fourier-transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy has emerged as a rapid and reliable method for bacterial typing. In this study, we evaluated FT-IR spectroscopy for characterizing a nosocomial outbreak caused by VIM-1-producing Klebsiella michiganensis (K. oxytoca complex). All K. oxytoca complex isolates collected during the outbreak period (N=27) and control isolates (N=8) were obtained from Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Spain. Among the 27 isolates, 22 were obtained from paediatric patients, 4 from adults and one was an environmental isolate. FT-IR spectroscopy was employed for bacterial typing, while whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used as the reference typing method for comparison. Analysis of the FT-IR spectra revealed distinct clusters, one of which corresponded to 19 outbreak isolates (18 from paediatric patients and the environmental isolate), suggesting a common origin. Other minor clusters did not exhibit any epidemiological relationship among the isolates. Subsequent WGS analysis identified Klebsiella michiganensis as the causative agent of the outbreak. FT-IR showed a high concordance with WGS in outbreak classification, supporting its reliability in this setting (Adjusted Rand Index=0.882; Adjusted Wallace Coefficient=0.937). Moreover, FT-IR spectra visualization highlighted discriminative features between outbreak and non-outbreak isolates, facilitating rapid screening when an outbreak is suspected. In conclusion, FT-IR spectroscopy represents a rapid and cost-effective method that enables timely intervention and effective management of nosocomial outbreaks. Its integration with WGS enhances the accuracy of outbreak investigations, demonstrating its utility in clinical microbiology and infection control practices.",Rodriguez-Temporal D; Sánchez-Cueto M; Buenestado-Serrano S; Blázquez-Sánchez M; Cercenado E; Gutiérrez-Pareja M; Molero-Salinas A; López-Camacho E; Muñoz P; de Viedma DG; Pérez-Lago L; Rodríguez-Sánchez B,"Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain.

We planned to conduct a study on the patients of peripheral nerve injuries who were referred for MRN and to compare the findings of MRN to those of nerve conduction studies (NCS) on various focal nerve disorders.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective study was conducted over 1½ years, involving 58 subjects with clinically diagnosed focal peripheral nerve pathologies who were referred for MRN to the Department of Radiodiagnosis and Imaging. The range of focal peripheral nerve pathologies detected using MRN was correlated and compared to NCS and/or electromyography results, as well as to surgical and/or histopathological results, wherever available. The Chi-squared (χ²) test and Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate the association between MRN and NCS outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>The study identified a broad spectrum of peripheral nerve pathologies. Out of 58 subjects, abnormalities were found in 52 (89.6%) subjects, whereas six patients (10.3%) did not show any significant abnormalities. Fifty patients (86.3%) showed abnormalities on both MRN and NCS, while five patients (8.6%) did not show any abnormalities on either MRN or NCS. Two patients (3.4%) showed abnormalities on MRN but had normal NCS results, and in one case (1.7%), MRN was normal but NCS showed an abnormality. Out of the 58 MRN examinations, 25 were found to have brachial plexus involvement.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MRN is a highly sensitive tool for evaluating peripheral nerve pathologies. Its correlation with NCS and intraoperative findings further supports its clinical utility. The 3 T MRN should be considered a key imaging modality in the diagnostic process for peripheral nerve pathologies. In addition, it serves as a valuable guide for planning therapeutic interventions and assessing prognosis in various patient subsets.",Dhanota DS; Singh D; Saggar K; Ahluwalia A; Singla M,"Department of Radiology, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.",Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology,2025-05-21,10.4103/aian.aian_751_24,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Brachial plexus; Mrn (Magnetic Resonance Neurography); Ncs-emg (Nerve Conduction Studies–electromyography); Peripheral Nerve Pathologies
40407110,Comparison of retinal function and macular structure after 27G pars plana vitrectomy with minimal heads-up versus standard illumination in patients with idiopathic epiretinal membranes: A pilot randomized study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To analyse the clinical benefits of using the NGENUITY 3D Visualization System in vitreoretinal surgery with low levels of endoillumination, focusing on functional and structural retinal protection in patients with idiopathic epiretinal membranes (ERM).<h4>Design</h4>Prospective, randomized, comparative study.<h4>Methods</h4>Forty pseudophakic patients (29♀, 11♂; age 60-80 years) with ERM underwent 27G pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and were randomly divided into two groups: Group I (20 eyes, 3D heads-up NGENUITY system, endoillumination 0.5 Lm) and Group II (20 eyes, standard microscope [Hi-R 900], endoillumination 3.2 Lm). Preoperative and 6-months postoperative evaluations included slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure (IOP, Pascal tonometer), Distance Best Corrected Visual Acuity (DBCVA, logMAR), Central Subfoveal Thickness (CST), Retinal Nerve Fibre Layer Thickness (RNFL, OCT), Pattern ERG (PERG), multifocal ERG (mfERG), flash ERG (ERG, ISCEV standards), and retinal sensitivity (HFA macula test). Surgery time, xenon light exposure, ERM/ILM peeling time, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), metamorphopsia incidence, and intra-/postoperative adverse events were analysed. Results were statistically evaluated (p < 0.05).<h4>Results</h4>Slit-lamp examination and IOP results were normal in both groups. DBCVA improved significantly (p = 0.005) in both groups but was better for Group I, albeit not statistically significant. CST and RNFL thickness decreased significantly in both groups (p = 0.01) and did not differ between them. In Group I, increased cone and ganglion cell function was registered, with PERG showing significantly higher increases in P50 and N95 wave amplitudes (p = 0.01) compared with Group II. In mfERG, an increase in P1-wave response density in Ring 1 (p = 0.01) was observed only in Group I. In ERG, Group I showed better rod (Ab, p = 0.04), cone (Aa, p = 0.03), and amacrine cell (scotopic OPS ∑A01 + A02 + A03, p = 0.02) function compared with Group II. Foveal threshold in the HFA macula test increased significantly only in Group I (p = 0.03). No significant differences were found in autofluorescence results, surgery times, xenon light exposure, or ERM and ILM peeling times between groups. Postoperatively, the frequency of absent or reduced severity of metamorphopsia was higher in Group I (71.4%) compared with Group II (61.5%). No intraoperative or postoperative adverse events occurred.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our preliminary results suggest that in patients with idiopathic ERM, 6 months after PPV using the NGENUITY 3D system with low levels of endoillumination, better retinal function was achieved compared with the standard PPV procedure, possibly due to reduced retinal phototoxicity. Further long-term studies are necessary to confirm that conclusion.",Lubiński W; Charabin T; Podborączyńska-Jodko K; Mularczyk M; Lachowicz-Gosławska E,"II Department of Ophthalmology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.",Acta ophthalmologica,2025-05-23,10.1111/aos.17526,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Erm; Retinal Function; Macular Structure; Ngenuity 3D; Standard Ppv Comparison
40397837,Noninvasive Assessment of the Risk Features of Hemorrhage in Moyamoya Disease Using 7T MRI.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>While digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is traditionally used for moyamoya disease (MMD) assessment, its invasiveness and limitations necessitate alternative methods. The higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio of 7T MRI improve the clarity of the image and retains the details of the structures. We aimed to assess the performance of 7T MRI in identifying hemorrhagic risk features of MMD compared with 3T MRI and DSA.<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional study recruited patients with MMD who underwent both 7T and 3T MRI scans within a 24-hour window, from March 2022 to December 2023. Patients were categorized into hemorrhagic, ischemic, and asymptomatic groups based on standard MRI findings and clinical symptoms. Corresponding DSA images acquired within 90 days were also collected as a comparative benchmark. Hemorrhage risk factors including dilatation and branch extension of the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) and posterior communicating artery (PComA) were assessed and graded on time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) and DSA images following established protocols. The hemorrhage locations were classified into anterior and posterior circulation groups.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 180 patients (mean age, 43.95 ± 11.02 [SD] years; 53.9% female) were included in the study (hemorrhagic = 51, ischemic = 37, asymptomatic = 92). Notably, 42.4% of AChA and 27.7% of PComA anomalies detected on 7T TOF-MRA were absent on 3T imaging. The 7T TOF-MRA demonstrated a strong correlation with DSA in assessing the AChA stage (weighted κ = 0.891, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and PComA stage (weighted κ = 0.761, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Higher AChA (70.6% vs 21.6% vs 6.5%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and PComA (51.0% vs 8.1% vs 12.0%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) grades were more common in patients with hemorrhagic MMD compared with ischemic and asymptomatic groups. In binary logistic regression analysis for hemorrhagic and ischemic groups, elevated stages of AChA (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% CI 1.20-3.54, <i>p</i> = 0.042) and PComA (OR 3.89, 95% CI 1.76-8.58, <i>p</i> = 0.001) were associated with increased hemorrhagic risk. Furthermore, the proportion of higher AChA (62.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.008) and PComA (51.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.010) grades were more prevalent in cases involving both anterior and posterior circulations.<h4>Discussion</h4>The 7T TOF-MRA visualization of dilatation and branching extension of the AChA and PComA indicates a heightened risk of hemorrhage, suggesting that this imaging technique could serve as a valuable noninvasive tool for identifying hemorrhagic vulnerabilities in MMD.<h4>Trial registration information</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05287750, Brain Diseases on 7.0T Magnetic Resonance Imaging, First Submitted January 2022. clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05287750.<h4>Classification of evidence</h4>This study provides Class II evidence that 7T-TOF MRA accurately distinguishes hemorrhagic risk in patients with MMD compared with 3T-TOF MRA and DSA.",Duan Q; Lyu J; Liu Z; Hao F; Li R; Liu S; Hao X; Li J; Bian X; Duan C; Wang S; Wang W; Wang R; Duan L; Lou X,"Department of Radiology, the First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.",Neurology,2025-05-21,10.1212/wnl.0000000000213617,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
