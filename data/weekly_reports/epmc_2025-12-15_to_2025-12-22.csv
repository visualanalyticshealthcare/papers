41411644,Development and Validation of a Cross-Device Platform for Anhedonia Trend Visualization by Using Ecological Momentary Assessment and Moving Averages (Part I): Protocol for a Methodological Pilot Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Anhedonia is a core symptom of depressive disorders. Although group-level cutoff points for the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) are established, real-time, individual-level monitoring remains limited. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) enables high-frequency sampling, and simple moving averages (SMA; 7/14/30 days) offer an interpretable way to smooth daily signals and surface early-warning trends.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to develop and validate a cross-device platform that collects EMA-based SHAPS responses and visualizes SMA trends for individual anhedonia monitoring. This part I protocol focuses on platform design, feasibility, usability, data quality, and initial analytical validity to inform subsequent evaluation.<h4>Methods</h4>We will conduct a single-arm methodological pilot in approximately 24 adults, recruited from an outpatient psychiatry clinic (clinical cohort) and a university setting (nonclinical cohort). After baseline assessment, participants will complete 30 days of daily EMA-SHAPS. Primary outcomes are feasibility (adherence, missingness patterns, timing fidelity) and usability/face validity (eg, System Usability Scale, qualitative feedback). We will also describe expert content validity ratings for key visual elements and exploratory analytic checks of within-person variability and the descriptive behavior of 7/14/30-day moving averages; these analyses are not powered for confirmatory hypothesis testing.<h4>Results</h4>This protocol specifies the design-validate sequence, recruitment procedures, and predefined adherence and missing-data rules for computing moving averages. Recruitment for the year-1 feasibility pilot is scheduled to begin in March 2026 following institutional review board approval (approval 114006; approval date: June 10, 2025), with feasibility metrics, usability indices, and parameter estimates used to refine alert logic and power calculations for a planned part II evaluation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Combining EMA-SHAPS with SMA-based trend visualizations may provide an interpretable way to summarize daily anhedonia signals and generate candidate early-warning indicators. This methodological pilot will deliver feasibility, usability, and preliminary analytic parameters needed to support a subsequent controlled evaluation of the platform's clinical utility.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>PRR1-10.2196/84024.",Ho YC; Fang CL; Ching YC; Chang HJ; Wang JY; Wang CC,"School of Nursing, College of Nursing, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.",JMIR research protocols,2025-12-18,10.2196/84024,13.0,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Data Visualization; Anhedonia; Moving Average; Early Warning Systems; Ecological Momentary Assessment; Mhealth; Digital Health; Snaith–hamilton Pleasure Scale
41396764,An Intelligent Interactive Visual Analytics System for Exploring Large and Multi-Scale Pathology Images.,"Pathology images are crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Although artificial intelligence has driven rapid ad vancements in pathology image analysis, the interpretation of ultra-large and multi-scale pathology images in clinical practice still heavily relies on physicians' experience. Clinicians need to repeatedly zoom in and out on individual slides to compare and assess pathological details - a process that is both time-consuming and prone to visual fatigue. The system first employs a diffusion model to perform tissue segmentation on pathology images, then calculates pathological tissue proportions and morphological metrics. Finally, through multi-scale dynamic comparison and multi-level visual evaluation, the system facilitates comprehensive and precise analysis of pathology images. The system provides clinicians with an intelligent and interactive tool for pathology image interpretation, enabling efficient visualization and precise analysis of pathological details, thereby reducing the effort require for detailed analysis.",Xu C; Yang R; Li W; Fu X; Fang L; Feng Z; Zhang X; Wang C; Song M; Chen W,,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2025-12-15,10.1109/tvcg.2025.3634833,8.3,"visual analytics(title); visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract)",
41417472,Investigating How Clinicians Form Trust in an AI-Based Mental Health Model: Qualitative Case Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Trust in artificial intelligence (AI) remains a critical barrier to the adoption of AI in mental health care. This study explores the formation of trust in an AI mental health model and its human-computer interface among clinicians at a web-based mental health clinic in the Region of Southern Denmark with national coverage.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to explore clinicians' perspectives on how trust is built in the context of an AI-supported mental health screening model and to identify the factors that influence this process.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a qualitative case study using semistructured interviews with clinicians involved in the pilot of a mental health AI model. Thematic analysis was used to identify key factors contributing to trust formation.<h4>Results</h4>Clinicians' initial attitudes toward AI were shaped by prior positive experiences with AI and their perception of AI's potential to reduce cognitive load in routine screening. Trust development followed a sequential pattern resembling a ""trust journey"": (1) sense-making, (2) risk appraisal, and (3) conditional decision to rely. Trust formation was supported by the explainability of the model, particularly through (1) visualization of confidence and uncertainty through violin plots, aligning with the clinicians' expectations of decision ambiguity; (2) feature attribution for and against predictions, which mirrored clinical reasoning; and (3) use of pseudo-sumscores in the AI model, which increased interpretability by presenting explanations in familiar clinical formats. Trust was contextually bounded to low-risk clinical scenarios, such as preinterview patient screening, and contingent on safety protocols (eg, suicide risk flagging). The use of both structured and unstructured patient data was seen as key to expanding trust into more complex clinical contexts. Participants also expressed a need for ongoing evaluation data to reinforce and maintain trust.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Clinicians' trust in AI tools is contextually and sequentially constructed, influenced by both model performance and alignment with clinical reasoning. Interpretability features were essential in establishing intrinsic trust, particularly when presented in ways that resonate with clinical norms. For broader acceptance and responsible deployment, trust must be supported by rigorous evaluation data and the inclusion of clinically relevant data types in model design.",Kelly A; Bhardwaj N; Holmberg Sainte-Marie TT; Van de Ven P; Melia R; Williams JE; Mathiasen K; Nielsen AS,"Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Limerick, Casteltroy, Limerick, V94 T9PX, Ireland, 353 61 202700.",JMIR human factors,2025-12-19,10.2196/79658,8.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract); machine learning(kw); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; ML; Decision support system; Mental health; AI; TRUST; Machine Learning; Explainable Ai; Xai; Intrinsic Trust
41413674,Automatic Assessment of Periodontium Complex in Intraoral Ultrasound Videos.,"Intraoral ultrasound (IUS) is emerging as a valuable imaging modality in dentistry, offering noninvasive, radiation-free, real-time visualization of periodontal structures. Unlike traditional imaging methods, IUS enables dynamic assessments during clinical procedures, supporting diagnostic and treatment-planning capabilities. The accurate evaluation of parameters such as alveolar bone level (ABL), gingival thickness (GT), and alveolar bone thickness (ABT) is critical for diagnosing periodontal diseases. However, current assessment techniques are typically manual, time-consuming, and based on static images, leading to inter-operator variability and limiting real-time application. To address these gaps, this study aimed to develop OralSAM, an end-to-end machine learning network for automated segmentation and quantitative assessment of periodontal structures in IUS videos. The network segments gingiva, enamel, alveolar bone, and cementum, followed by a morphological analysis pipeline to extract clinically relevant measurements. A total of 158 IUS videos from 30 orthodontic patients were included, and the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing subsets following a 6:2:2 ratio. The segmentation performance of OralSAM, evaluated against expert-annotated ground truth, demonstrated high segmentation accuracy across key periodontal structures. Morphological measurements derived from the machine learning network also exhibited strong inter-rater reliability, as confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis, which demonstrated narrow limits of agreement (LOAs) for ABL (mean bias = -0.063 mm, LOA = -0.771 to 0.646 mm), GT (mean bias = -0.063 mm, LOA = -0.24 to 0.115 mm), and ABT (mean bias = -0.002 mm, LOA = -0.104 to 0.1 mm). The intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.893 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.864 to 0.915) for ABL, 0.918 (95% CI, 0.768 to 0.960) for GT, and 0.848 (95% CI, 0.806 to 0.880) for ABT. These findings highlight OralSAM's capability to accurately delineate periodontal structures and provide consistent assessments. The proposed framework shows strong potential for integration into routine chairside workflows, enabling early detection, real-time monitoring, and personalized management of periodontal disease.",Kumaralingam L; Hoang MH; Nguyen KCT; Kaipatur NR; Dinh HBV; Alavi J; Punithakumar K; Lou EHM; Major PW; Le LH,"Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",Journal of dental research,2025-12-18,10.1177/00220345251387713,8.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw); machine learning(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Segmentation; Periodontitis; Machine Learning; Real-time Imaging; Intraoral Ultrasound Imaging
41409025,Advanced endoscopy and artificial intelligence-enabled vascular healing for ulcerative colitis: promising frontiers or mere mirage?,"Ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, is characterized by subtle microvascular alterations that play a critical role in disease perpetuation and mucosal injury. Recent advances in image-enhanced endoscopy and ultrahigh-magnification endoscopy have improved the real-time visualization of these vascular changes while highlighting their diagnostic value. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled endoscopic systems provide automated, reproducible vascular assessments. Emerging data suggest that AI-based vascular healing correlates with clinical remission and may alter histological scores, enabling the prediction of sustained remission. Despite these promising advances, challenges remain, such as standardizing vascular healing definitions, addressing interobserver variability, and validating AI-driven platforms in real-world settings. Integrating microvascular-targeted therapies and advanced imaging has the potential to transform the management of ulcerative colitis, facilitating sustained remission and improving the quality of life. This review examined the evolving role of microvascular assessment in ulcerative colitis, the potential of AI in refining endoscopic evaluation, and the prospects of incorporating vascular healing as a therapeutic target.",Maeda Y; Kudo SE; Kuroki T; Kawabata Y; Ohara J; Ichimasa K; Ogata N; Ohtsuka K; Misawa M,"Digestive Disease Center, Showa Medical University Northern Yokohama Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.",Clinical endoscopy,2025-12-15,10.5946/ce.2025.186,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Microvessels; Prognosis; Endoscopy; Ulcerative colitis
41401388,Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Short-Term Mortality in Patients With Severe Acute Pancreatitis: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To identify risk factors for short-term mortality in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), establish a predictive model for early high-risk patient identification, and guide clinical decision-making.<h4>Methods</h4>SAP patients admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from September 2018 to September 2025 were enrolled, divided into mortality and survival groups by 28-day prognosis. Clinical data were collected. Features were strictly selected through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, Boruta algorithm, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). Seven machine learning (ML) models were built, with external validation using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) data. Model performance was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curves. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was used to interpret contributions of important features, and a web-based calculator was developed for visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Ten features were selected. The Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model had the best generalization, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.964 (95% CI: 0.942-0.987, training), 0.927 (95% CI: 0.885-0.970, testing), and 0.811 (95% CI: 0.772-0.851, validation). Calibration curves confirmed predicted-actual consistency; decision curves showed net clinical benefit. SHAP analysis identified the ranking of feature importance as follows: mechanical ventilation, age, blood urea nitrogen, urine output, lactate, total bilirubin, platelet count, congestive heart failure history, red blood cell distribution width, and serum creatinine. The web-based calculator had good clinical applicability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The GBM model demonstrates the best performance in predicting short-term mortality in SAP patients.",Cheng C; Guo D; Gu J; Wang D; Li W; Cao X; Miao B; Fei S,"Graduate School, Xuzhou Medical University.",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,2025-12-17,10.1097/mcg.0000000000002311,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Prediction model; Severe acute pancreatitis; Machine Learning; Gradient Boosting Machine; Shap Analysis
41396416,Subtraction-based Stepwise computed tomography post-processing with probabilistically adjusted thresholding for fat-ice demarcation: an in situ study.,"Intraprocedural visualization of the iceball boundary is often limited at the fat-ice interface, where frozen fat-despite increased computed tomography (CT) values-remains within the negative range, thus yielding limited contrast with non-frozen fat. This limitation is relevant in CT-guided renal cryoablation involving perirenal fat. We evaluated a stepwise CT post-processing method of subtraction and scaled addition with probabilistically adjusted thresholding, using an in situ fat-muscle phantom. This two-step process involved fixed zero-threshold subtraction (Step 1: post-freezing image minus pre-freezing image) and kernel density estimation-based threshold subtraction (Step 2: Step 1 output minus post-freezing image), based on pixel-wise fat-attenuation distributions. Contrast-to-noise ratio improved in both fat and non-fat tissues. In fat tissue, boundary contrast selectively increased by reducing CT values in non-frozen regions, whereas in non-fat tissue, by reducing them in frozen regions. Iceball boundaries aligned with magnetic resonance imaging. This approach may improve iceball demarcation and warrants validation in clinical practice.",Itou C; Ishihara Y; Urikura A; Sone M,"Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, National Cancer Center Hospital, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan. chitou@ncc.go.jp.",Radiological physics and technology,2025-12-15,10.1007/s12194-025-00992-1,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Kernel Density Estimation; Image Subtraction; Phantom Study; Computed Tomography-guided Cryoablation; Frozen/non-frozen Fat Boundary; Iceball Visualization
41405348,Revolutionizing thyroid nodule diagnosis in Hashimoto's thyroiditis: AI-driven radiomics and deep learning model.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid nodules(TNs) in the context of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is challenging. This study aimed to explore the diagnostic efficacy of artificial intelligence (AI) models constructed using radiomics and deep learning (DL) features extracted from the ultrasound images of TNs in the setting of HT. The study also aimed to quantitatively compare the diagnostic performance of these models against that of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology combined with BRAFV600E gene mutation testing so as to establish a superior diagnostic paradigm for TNs in HT.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed the clinical data and preoperative ultrasound images of 1585 patients with HT admitted to 8 hospitals in China between 1 January 2018, and 30 December 2023. Radiomics features were extracted from each manually annotated and standardized region of interest in the images. The DL features based on various convolutional neural network models were also extracted, including 11 pre-trained DL models based on real images and the image features extracted using a combined DL-radiomics (DLR) approach. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to select features with nonzero coefficients. Further, eight machine learning methods were employed to construct prediction models, namely the DLR models, incorporating both DL and radiomics features. The importance of features in contributing to the model was prioritized using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method for interpretation. The predictive performance of the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Two rounds of reader studies were conducted (first round: independent reading; second round: guided reading) to validate the clinical application value of the DLR model, with results compared with FNA biopsy outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1561 radiomics features and 256 DL features were extracted from the original images. The DLR model, leveraging the ResNet152 neural network, could effectively differentiate between benign and malignant nodules in the context of HT. The AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the logistic regression (LR) model, based on these features, were 0.917 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.838-0.988], 85.7%, 81.8%, and 86.6%, respectively, in the validation cohort and 0.827(95% CI: 0.777-0.876), 93.9%, 80.9%, and 96.3%, respectively, in the external test cohort. The SHAP summary plot illustrated how feature values influenced their impact on the model, whereas the SHAP force plot showed the integrated impact of features on individual responses. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM)-generated heatmaps from DL models visually highlighted high-risk areas in HT. The DLR model outperformed five junior-level physicians in terms of diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the validation cohort. The diagnostic performance of all clinicians was significantly enhanced with the assistance of the DLR model, with no statistical difference detected compared with the FNA biopsy results.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The DLR model combined with the SHAP and Grad-CAM method can improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists in identifying benign and malignant TNs in the context of HT. The diagnostic efficacy of this visualization model is comparable to that of FNA cytology combined with gene mutation testing. The DLR model can enhance the diagnostic ability of radiologists in differentiating between benign and malignant TNs in the context of HT, thereby minimizing unnecessary biopsies. Additionally, it can aid clinicians in making personalized decisions regarding the necessity of biopsy or even surgery by providing intuitive visual explanations.",Wu F; Pan T; Huang X; Huang K; Shi J; Mao L; Ni Y; Luo D; Zhang Y,"Department of Oncological Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Westlake University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",2025-12-16,10.1097/js9.0000000000004546,7.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma; Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis; Deep Learning; Shap Value
41413879,Drainage of liver abscess guided by ultrasound combined with three-dimensional visualization technology and ICG fluorescence navigation technology: a case report.,"<h4>Background</h4>Liver abscess is a common digestive system disorder primarily caused by bacterial infection. Effective treatment often involves drainage, in which ultrasound technology is commonly used to guide puncture and drainage procedures. However, ultrasound has inherent limitations such as suboptimal visualization of abscess boundaries and adjacent vascular anatomy. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence navigation and three-dimensional (3D) visualization are two intraoperative navigation technologies that, when integrated with ultrasound, overcome these constraints. This synergy improves localization accuracy and abscess size assessment, thereby reducing procedural complexity.<h4>Case description</h4>This article details the case of a 61-year-old male patient hospitalized for a 4-day history of fever of unknown origin, ultimately diagnosed with a pyogenic liver abscess. Preoperative management included standardized antibiotic therapy. The patient subsequently underwent concurrent laparoscopic abscess fenestration and drainage with cholecystectomy. Intraoperative precision localization of the liver abscess was achieved through ultrasound-guided ICG fluorescence imaging integrated with 3D visualization technology, ensuring successful surgical completion. During the 3-month postoperative follow-up, the patient developed no complications.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ICG fluorescence imaging and 3D visualization technologies demonstrate clinical utility in the management of liver abscesses, providing valuable insights for laparoscopic surgical intervention.",Mai J; Zhou Y; Zeng S; Zhong H; Huang Z; Cai P; Zeng N,"General Surgery Center, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510280, China.",BMC surgery,2025-12-19,10.1186/s12893-025-03424-4,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",
41419508,Trustworthy deep learning for malaria diagnosis using explainable artificial intelligence.,"Malaria remains a major global health concern, particularly in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. Traditional diagnostic methods such as microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) suffer from scalability, sensitivity, and expertise-related limitations, underscoring the need for automated diagnostic strategies. This study investigates deep learning models for malaria detection from blood smear images. Four convolutional neural networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2, VGG19, InceptionV3, and ResNet18, were empirically evaluated, with ResNet18 achieving the highest F1-score of 96.33%. Building on these results, two advanced hybrid architectures, Xception and Inception-ResNetV2, were fine-tuned on a dataset of 27,090 images from the Kaggle malaria collection, attaining classification accuracies of approximately 98% on validation and test sets. Model robustness was further confirmed using an independent dataset from the Harvard Dataverse containing thick smear images captured under varied staining and imaging conditions, where accuracy remained consistently high (97-98%). To enhance interpretability and clinical trust, three explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), were employed. These complementary methods provide spatial, superpixel, and pixel-level transparency into the models' decision-making. Furthermore, representative misdiagnosed samples are presented, wherein these visualization techniques reveal morphological and staining artifacts that led to erroneous predictions, clarifying model failure modes and improving transparency. The proposed AI-based diagnostic framework thus demonstrates high accuracy, interpretability, and generalization, representing a scalable solution for malaria detection in resource-limited healthcare settings.",Parveen R; Qui B; Song W; Al-Kahtani N; Jamjoom MM; Mostafa SM; Sultan N; Fatima J,"School of Computer and Artificial intelligence, Zhengzhou University, 100, Science Avenue, Zhengzhou, 450001, Henan, China.",Scientific reports,2025-12-19,10.1038/s41598-025-28387-7,5.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(title,abstract); data(abstract)",Lime; Medical Image Classification; Deep Learning; Malaria Detection; Explainable Ai; Grad-cam; Xception; Inception-resnetv2; Blood Smear Analysis
41406351,3D Total Body Photography as a Promising Innovation for Early Skin Cancer Detection: Scoping Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Skin cancer (SC) is a global health concern because of its high and still increasing incidence and associated health care cost. Belgium is no exception as 1 in 5 people are diagnosed with SC before the age of 75 years. The VECTRA WB360, a 3D total body photography system, allows clinicians to objectively compare the totality of the skin on a macroscopic level on further appointments. The integrated lesion visualization software allows automated detection, counts, and assessment of skin lesions. Detailed comparison of individual lesions is possible through the attached digital dermatoscope.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to review available literature on the use of the VECTRA in research and clinical settings and to summarize the clinical utility, advantages, and limitations reported for this system.<h4>Methods</h4>An electronic literature search was conducted on PubMed from December 2023 to March 2024 using a combination of the following search terms: 3D imaging, VECTRA WB360, melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, their synonyms, and associated entry terms. Publications that used a device other than the VECTRA WB360 were excluded, as were papers reporting on new technology without further research or without added cases. After a thorough screening of the papers and removal of duplicates, 11 papers remained.<h4>Results</h4>Our literature search yielded 11 relevant papers, which included 2 case studies, 6 prospective studies, and 3 retrospective studies. According to multiple studies, the VECTRA WB360 images were of a high enough quality to allow on-screen diagnosis of some melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers by dermatologists. Sensitivity compared to face-to-face examination for melanoma is unknown. The integrated lesion visualization software is capable of detecting and counting naevi and distinguishing melanoma from other skin lesions with high accuracy, with convolutional neural network integration further enhancing its sensitivity and specificity. However, it is important to note that no comparison to the usual standard of care was made. Also, dermatologists achieved greater specificity and thus remained superior to machine and artificial intelligence (AI).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although the VECTRA 3D TBP holds substantial promise for the early detection and monitoring of SC, its application cannot yet replace the expertise of trained clinicians. Although the lesion visualizer and dermoscopy explainable intelligence (DEXI) score offer potential enhancements, they also pose risks, including a significant increase in unnecessary excisions due to lower specificity. Expert overview is still recommended and superior, since there is not enough evidence yet that 3D TBP or AI is reliable on its own or beneficial as a support tool. Given the small samples and lack of blinded trials, further studies are needed to explore and improve the diagnostic capacities of 3D TBP and the possible integration of CNNs or other AI extensions and to examine the VECTRA 360WB compared to the usual standard of care.",Baete F; Jakers AL; Delanoye E; Vande Velde N; Voet G,"Clinique Dermatologie Gent, Hippoliet lippensplein 24A, Gent, 9000, Belgium, 32 093353783.",JMIR dermatology,2025-12-17,10.2196/68510,5.5,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract)",Melanoma; Artificial intelligence; Skin Cancer; Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer; 3D Total Body Imaging; 3D Total Body Photography
41406273,SigTime: Learning and Visually Explaining Time Series Signatures.,"Understanding and distinguishing temporal patterns in time series data is essential for scientific discovery and decisionmaking. For example, in biomedical research, uncovering meaningful patterns in physiological signals can improve diagnosis, risk assessment, and patient outcomes. However, existing methods for time series pattern discovery face major challenges, including high computational complexity, limited interpretability, and difficulty in capturing meaningful temporal structures. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel learning framework that jointly trains two Transformer models using complementary time series representations: shapelet-based representations to capture localized temporal structures and traditional feature engineering to encode statistical properties. The learned shapelets serve as interpretable signatures that differentiate time series across classification labels. Additionally, we develop a visual analytics system-SigTime-with coordinated views to facilitate exploration of time series signatures from multiple perspectives, aiding in useful insights generation. We quantitatively evaluate our learning framework on eight publicly available datasets and one proprietary clinical dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through two usage scenarios along with the domain experts: one involving public ECG data and the other focused on preterm labor analysis.",Huang YC; Chen J; Liu D; Ma KL,,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2025-12-17,10.1109/tvcg.2025.3644956,5.1,"visual analytics(abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract)",
41236319,[The Development of Algorithm of Intellectual System of Supporting Decision-Making in Mammographic Diagnostics of Breast Cancer Based on Convolutional Neuronic Network].,"The article considers issues of training models of convolutional neuronic network (CNN) for automated identification of point functions of visualization to discern mammography pictures belonging to negative, false benign and malignant cases, targeting to improve interpretation of results of mammographic examination. On the basis of automated deep training (application of CNN) the approach is proposed, that permits to detect small differences in mammographic pictures to diagnose true positive and false positive results. The information base for training CNN is represented by digital base (open resource for methods of intellectual studying of analysis of mammographic pictures) of data of mammography screening of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Winston-Salem Medical College, the USA. The share of false positive results according trained model in the total number of examined patients from different age groups made up from 22% to 32%. To compare, share of false positive results based on decoding of mammographic picture by medical specialist varied from 34% to 53%. The trained model based on the CNN can be used for mammographic pictures of any database. The predictive accuracy of model depends, among other things, on volume of training sample. Therefore, formation of open database of results of mammographic examinations with accurately established diagnosis will permit later on to broadly apply possibilities of deep training in medical practice.

41411808,A filter-level explainability framework for CNNs in histopathology image analysis.,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable accuracy in histopathology image classification, yet their decision logic remains largely opaque. Most explainability methods, such as Grad-CAM or SHAP, provide only coarse heatmaps, offering limited insight into the role of individual filters. This study introduces a filter-level explainability framework that quantitatively aligns single-filter activations with Grad-CAM outputs using similarity metrics (Pearson correlation, Dice coefficient, mean squared error), integrates progressive ablation experiments to assess filter contributions, and applies region-based scoring to capture intensity, frequency, and spatial distribution. Evaluations are conducted on the LC25000 dataset, a widely used benchmark comprising 25,000 histopathology image patches from lung and colon tissues (benign and malignant classes). The results demonstrate strong classification performance (Accuracy 0.964, F1-score 0.965, ROC-AUC 0.997) and high filter-to-Grad-CAM agreement (≈0.97 Pearson, ≈0.95 Dice), supported by statistical significance testing. In contrast to prior studies that mainly rely on qualitative visualization, the proposed framework delivers a systematic, statistically validated, and multidimensional approach to filter-level interpretability in CNN-based histopathology analysis. While demonstrated on the LC25000 dataset, the methodological contribution is designed in principle to be dataset-agnostic, as it operates on the final convolutional layer irrespective of dataset choice. By moving beyond qualitative heatmaps, the framework offers a rigorous and reproducible pathway to better understanding CNN decisions, with potential to enhance trust, transparency, and clinical adoption of AI in pathology. In addition, we outline key considerations for translating the framework into routine pathology practice.",Uzun S; Yildirim G,"Graduate School of Natural and Applied Sciences, Computer Engineering, Firat University, Elazig, Turkey.

As these programs expand, the management of the extensive data they generate becomes increasingly complex, highlighting the need for structured digital solutions. This narrative review article presents a pragmatic framework aimed at clarifying big data analytics tailored to the needs and practices of healthcare professionals and administrators, focusing on effective integration into routine screening workflows. To achieve effective data utilization, the process begins with systematic archiving, which involves cloud-based storage solutions capable of securely maintaining various data formats in compliance with regulatory standards, thus ensuring long-term accessibility and continuity. Subsequent real-time processing of screening data facilitates rapid decision-making and patient management by providing immediate validation and analysis, essential for maintaining the responsiveness of screening services. Transformation processes play a critical role in converting diverse data inputs into standardized, consistent formats, enabling seamless communication and exchange among multiple healthcare systems. Integration further builds upon this standardization, merging data from different healthcare providers and diagnostic centers into centralized analytical platforms. This unified approach enables comprehensive patient monitoring and supports predictive modeling for early identification of at-risk individuals. Advanced analytics, particularly process mining and predictive techniques, reveal inefficiencies within screening workflows, highlighting areas needing improvement. These methods help healthcare managers to streamline operations, optimize resources, and enhance overall program performance. Real-time visualization tools provide administrators with continuous, practical insights into operational dynamics, despite existing challenges related to data governance and system interoperability. This article illustrates these concepts through concrete examples from the colorectal cancer screening program in Northern Portugal and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The colorectal cancer screening scenario demonstrates how structured data management significantly boosts operational efficiency and healthcare accessibility. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 experience highlights the importance of having flexible digital infrastructures capable of quickly adapting to unexpected crises. Finally, ongoing investments in digital infrastructure, professional training, and comprehensive data governance are crucial for sustaining these improvements. This review provides clear, actionable knowledge to support healthcare professionals in adopting big data analytics effectively within preventive healthcare programs.",Monteiro H; Oliveira M; Martinho R; Martins C,Faculdade de Medicina.

41412489,Missense3D-PTMdb: a web tool for visualising and exploring human genetic variants and post-translational modification sites using AlphaFold models.,"Only a fraction of the >11 million missense variants identified in humans has a known clinical significance. Post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and ubiquitination, are key regulators of protein function and structure. PTMs depend on correct protein folding and the recognition and binding of enzymes to specific amino acid motifs near modification sites. AlphaFold models provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore variants on 3D structures, enabling systematic identification of amino acid substitutions that could affect PTMs and should be further investigated experimentally. We present Missense3D-PTMdb, a ""one-stop-shop"" interactive web tool that provides a user-friendly sequence-structure mapping of 20,235 human proteins, 11,5 million naturally occurring human missense variants, >60 PTM types and 203,775 PTM residues and their neighbours in sequence and 3D structure space using AlphaFold models of the human proteome. The resource also supports visualization of novel variants not in the database.

41413827,Predicting host tropism in influenza a viruses: insights from multi-segment nucleotide signatures.,"<h4>Background</h4>Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant public health threat due to its cross-species transmission and complex host adaptation mechanisms. This study integrated whole-genome data from avian, human, swine, and bovine IAV strains, using machine learning to predict viral host tropism based on nucleotide site features and to identify key sites driving host adaptation along with their synergistic effects.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 64,000 IAV sequences from avian, human, swine, and bovine hosts were analyzed to build host-prediction models. A four-class classification framework (avian, human, swine, bovine) was constructed using nucleotide site features from all eight genomic segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, MP, NS). Eight machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM, KNN, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM) were benchmarked via 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUPRC, and AUC. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis prioritized critical nucleotide sites, while bivariate association tests identified synergistic/antagonistic interactions between sites. Nucleotide composition profiles were compared across host groups using hierarchical clustering and heatmap visualization.<h4>Results</h4>The XGBoost algorithm demonstrated the best and most stable performance, achieving an AUC value of over 0.95 in distinguishing human-derived sequences from non-human ones. SHAP analysis identified the top 20 critical nucleotide sites for each gene segment, such as sites 46 and 698 in the NS segment. Nucleotide composition analysis revealed high similarity between human and swine sequences in the HA and PB2 segments, and between avian and bovine sequences. The HA segment was particularly challenging in differentiating human from swine strains. Bivariate site association analysis uncovered significant synergistic or antagonistic effects between key sites within gene segments, forming complex networks. For instance, in the NS segment, a positive prediction contribution was observed when sites 371, 698, and 419 were all G.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study advances our mechanistic understanding of IAV host adaptation, identifies molecular determinants for zoonotic risk stratification, and establishes a scalable machine learning framework for predicting viral host tropism through nucleotide signature analysis, thereby enhancing surveillance strategies and informing preventive measures against emerging viral threats.",Chen W; Pei T; Zhang Z; Liu X; He X; Hu J; Lu S; Chen Q; Hu S; Zhuang S; Chen J; Zhuang J; Xiong C,"Shanghai Changning District Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Shanghai Changning District Health Inspection Institute), Shanghai, 200335, China.",Journal of translational medicine,2025-12-19,10.1186/s12967-025-07569-x,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(abstract),Predictive modeling; Influenza A viruses; Cross-species Transmission; Host Tropism; Nucleotide Signature
41422279,Mapping risks of health conditions in people with atopic eczema in English primary care and hospital data.,"Atopic eczema may be associated with multiple health conditions. Here, we systematically explore risks across the full health spectrum based on the International Classification of Diseases, assessing associations between eczema and 2058 ICD-10 codes, 1593 phecodes, and 201 Global Burden of Disease codes. In English primary care electronic health records (1997 - 2023) we identify cohorts of people with eczema (up to 3 million) and matched (by age, sex, general practice) comparators without eczema (up to 14 million). In up to 25 years of follow-up, we capture outcomes recorded during hospital admissions. People with eczema show higher rates of several outcomes across multiple organ systems. Among those followed up from eczema diagnosis in childhood, atopic/allergic conditions and infections account for most excess diagnoses. Consistent across cohorts and analyses, large relative risk increases are seen for inflammatory bowel conditions (e.g., K50 Crohn disease, crude hazard ratio 1.70 [1.63-1.77]) and eye diseases (e.g., H16 Keratitis, crude hazard ratio 1.71 [1.57-1.86]).

41407287,Piloting a Novel eHealth Technology for the Control and Management of Elevated Blood Pressure in Rwanda (HeartCare@Home Project): Protocol for a 2-Phase Crossover Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Effective blood pressure (BP) monitoring is vital for the management of hypertension, allowing timely adjustments in treatment. This study focuses on the development and implementation of an innovative, locally designed eHealth technology, the HeartCare@Home system, to enhance the control and management of hypertension in outpatient noncommunicable disease (NCD) clinics in Rwanda. The HeartCare@Home system comprises a mobile health app that incorporates rapid SMS technology, an integrated dashboard for signal reception at the clinic office level, and a clinical decision support algorithm.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to assess the clinical efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a novel eHealth technology, the HeartCare@Home system, that uses home and clinic-based automated BP monitoring with real-time management of elevated BP in an outpatient NCD clinic in Rwanda.<h4>Methods</h4>This pilot study will use an interventional design with a crossover approach to test the clinical efficacy of the HeartCare@Home system at the NCD clinic of Kibagabaga District Hospital. A total of 140 patients with hypertension will take part in the study. All enrolled patients will be allocated to either the interventional group or the standard of care group. The follow-up for each group will be 6 months (3 months in each group follow-up). The data for the intervention group will be generated by our mobile health app, while data for the control group (standard care) will be retrieved from usual patient files at the NCD clinic. Data extraction sheets will be used for standard care data retrieval. The Feasibility of Intervention Measure and Acceptability of Intervention Measure tools will be used to cross-sectionally evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the HeartCare@Home system. Data will be summarized with descriptive statistics. A paired sample 2-tailed t test will be used to test for differences between the pre- and postintervention records for hypertension control.<h4>Results</h4>This study will yield a technical infrastructure, the HeartCare@Home system, to support the control and management of hypertension in outpatient NCD clinics. It will introduce a new model of health care delivery through innovative technology that enables home-based BP monitoring. This will offer a unique technology to enable elevated BP control and timely hypertension management and will also ensure a real-time communication linkage between patients and the appropriate level of care. Furthermore, the findings from the assessment of the clinical efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of the HeartCare@Home system will inform possible scalability of the system to more NCD clinics. The study is currently in the implementation stage.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The HeartCare@Home project will address the important gap of low BP control rates in patients with hypertension, which has contributed to delayed consultations and increased cardiovascular mortality. Such eHealth technology infrastructure may also be scalable to other settings.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/66211.",Nishimwe A; Gasana J; Mugeni R; Twizere C; Hitimana E; Bahati O; Mukeshimana O; Manirafasha C; Bugingo JD; Ntaganda E; Uwinkindi F; Twagirumukiza M,"University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda.",JMIR research protocols,2025-12-17,10.2196/66211,3.0,dashboard(abstract); clinical decision support(abstract); data(abstract),Hypertension; Rwanda; Ehealth Technology; Ehealth Innovation; Heart Care At Home
41422011,"A century of emergence: trends and patterns in human viral pathogens, 1900-2024, a systematic review.","<h4>Background</h4>Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose ongoing global health threats, making it essential to understand their temporal, geographic, and biological patterns to inform prevention and control strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic review of 212 human viruses reported between 1900 and 2024, drawing data from Scopus, PubMed, and grey literature, and applied an adapted PRISMA framework. Temporal trends, geographic origins, modes of transmission, and clinical syndromes were analyzed, complemented by a novel visualization tool for exploring patterns interactively.<h4>Results</h4>Viral emergence peaked during 1950-1979 (n = 87) and again since 2000 (n = 52), with the United States (n = 42), China (n = 15), and Australia (n = 10) most frequently reported as initial detection sites, reflecting differences in surveillance and research capacity. RNA viruses, particularly influenza viruses and coronaviruses, dominated emergence events. Vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens accounted for 62% of EIDs. Temporal peaks corresponded with advancements in molecular diagnostics, laboratory infrastructure, and global surveillance networks. We identified 212 viruses, with most emerging between 1950 and 1979 (n = 87) and 52 since 2000. Febrile disease was predominant (27.4%), with respiratory and hemorrhagic diseases also prevalent.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings highlight how technological, ecological, and socio-demographic factors shape viral emergence.

41401591,Patterns of metastasis and nodal disease in tongue and buccal carcinomas: Case-based reflections in Delhi NCR Region.,"<h4>Background</h4>Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a large source of cancer-related morbidity in India especially when it involves the tongue and the buccal mucosa. Despite the fact that TNM staging provides a global framework, regional patterns of metastasis, comorbidity interaction and concordance between imaging and pathology are not uniformly represented. This study will investigate nodal disease patterns in a group of people in the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) and will suggest more specific treatments. The research aims to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention pathways and to reduce inequality in healthcare service provision.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty patients with OSCC who had been diagnosed between 2023 and 2025 were the subjects of a retrospective study conducted on tertiary oncology centres in Delhi NCR. Inclusion criteria were confirmation of primary OSCC of the tongue or buccal mucosa, availability of PET -CT or MRI images, full TNM staging, and comorbidity information. Data visualization included heatmaps, scatter plot, cluster diagram and radar charts. Along with the imaging concordance, tumour site, the size of the lesion, nodal involvement, and the burden of comorbidity were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Bilateral nodal involvement was higher in the Tongue OSCC, mostly at Level II and III, but the tumours of the buccal mucosa were mostly limited to Level Ib unilateral. Nodal burden was much higher in lesions of around 3.5 cm. Comorbidities (diabetes and chronic kidney disease) were also related to higher FDG uptake and necrosis, but the relationships were not statistically significant. PET-CT had 85 percent agreement with the pathology of the surgery. The decision of treatment was based on the staging with surgery being the preferred treatment option in early disease and chemoradiation in advanced ones.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The site and size of tumour have a significant impact on nodal dissemination in OSCC. Bilateral neck dissection can be a wise option in case of early tongue lesions involving the midline but selective unilateral dissection is adequate in selecting cases involving the buccal lesions. It is necessary to couple comorbidity profiling with imaging results when planning pre-treatment.

41421494,"Development and Clinical Validation of OncCNV: A Pipeline for Comprehensive Genome-Wide Analysis of Oncogene Amplifications, Homozygous Deletions, and Biallelic Inactivation of Tumor Suppressor Genes Using the TSO500 Kit.","Large-scale tumor molecular profiling has enabled the discovery of novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers, while expanding the clinical utility of known alterations such as gene amplifications (GAMP), homozygous deletions (HMZ-Del), and biallelic inactivation (BI) of tumor suppressor genes. Comprehensive clinical detection of these events is essential for optimal patient management. Illumina's TSO500 kit detects multiple biomarkers, including GAMP for select genes, but does not assess HMZ-Del or BI events. To address this gap, we developed OncCNV, a genome-wide copy number analysis and visualization pipeline that integrates both on-target and off-target probe data from TSO500 sequencing. OncCNV performance was optimized by evaluating different toolkits, on-target, and off-target probes for CNV calling and visualization, off-target bin sizes, and panel of normal configurations. Clinical validation was performed using 132 unique solid tumors characterized by a clinically validated microarray assay. OncCNV showed >96% positive percent agreement, >99% negative percent agreement, and >99% accuracy across all markers at the assay's established limit of detection (40 ng DNA at 40% tumor content). Sensitivity for HMZ-Del and BI detection decreased to 62-70% at tumor content 20-39% in in silico dilution experiments; however, intra- and inter-run and inter-analyst precision remained >99%.

41411064,Real-time wireless signal processing for contactless heart rate monitoring with impulse-radio ultra-wideband radar technology.,"Impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar technology employs short-duration impulse waves with broad bandwidth for precise detection and tracking, offering a cost-effective, non-invasive alternative for portable heart rate monitoring. Its practical design supports long-term healthcare applications without adverse effects. However, effective implementation necessitates robust signal processing techniques to minimize interference from clutter signals and breathing harmonics, enabling the extraction of the target signal from background noise and interference. This study aims to provide real-time measurements through the implementation of signal processing algorithms such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), autocorrelation, and peak finding with a moving average filter (MAF) to extract heartbeat signals from background noise and interference. Algorithms were tuned for range parameters and bandpass filter order, with a Kaiser window-based FIR filter (order 250) selected for testing. The FFT algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 85.6%, while peak finding with MAF and autocorrelation attained accuracies of 78.5% and 76.6%, respectively. The FFT algorithm demonstrated superior potential for real-time heart rate monitoring and was implemented in a graphical user interface (GUI) for data visualization.",Fauzi SM; Kamarudin LM; Yii TT,"Faculty of Intelligent Computing, Universiti Malaysia Perlis, Perlis, Malaysia.",Biomedical physics & engineering express,2025-12-18,10.1088/2057-1976/ae183a,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),non-contact; FFT; Autocorrelation; Ir-uwb; Fir Kaiser Window; Peak Finding With Moving Average Filter; Wireless Heart Rate Detection
41421960,Systematic review on CT/MRI-guided sonodynamic cancer therapy.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) represents a novel noninvasive cancer treatment method which uses ultrasound (US) to activate sonosensitizers that produce cytotoxic effects in deep tissues by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). The clinical application of this therapy faces obstacles related to tumor localization and complications in real-time monitoring.<h4>Methods</h4>This systematic review evaluates recent preclinical advances in computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -guided SDT using nano contrast agents (NCAs). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from January 2015 to March 2025 identified 26 eligible studies. Data on nanoconstruct design, imaging mechanisms, therapeutic outcomes, and translational potential were extracted and assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of studies utilized MRI-guided SDT systems that applied gadolinium or manganese-based NCAs to enhance soft tissue contrast and provide real-time monitoring capabilities. High-atomic-number nanoparticles were used in CT-guided SDT to achieve improved anatomical resolution. The dual-modal platforms showed better tumor visualization along with stronger ROS production and tumor regression while keeping systemic toxicity to a minimum.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The CT/MRI-guided SDT provides a promising theranostic method to achieve precise and effective cancer treatment.

41411350,OpenVocabCT: Towards Universal Text-driven CT Image Segmentation.,"Computed tomography (CT) is extensively used for accurate visualization and segmentation of organs and lesions. While deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have significantly improved CT image analysis, their performance often declines when applied to diverse, real-world clinical data. Although foundation models offer a broader and more adaptable solution, their potential is limited due to the challenge of obtaining large-scale, voxel-level annotations for medical images. In response to these challenges, prompting-based models using visual or text prompts have emerged. Visual-prompting methods, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), still require significant manual input and can introduce ambiguity when applied to clinical scenarios. Instead, foundation models that use text prompts offer a more versatile and clinically relevant approach. Notably, current text-prompt models, such as the CLIP-Driven Universal Model, are limited to text prompts already encountered during training and struggle to process the complex and diverse scenarios of real-world clinical applications. Instead of fine-tuning models trained from natural imaging, we propose OpenVocabCT, a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale 3D CT images for universal text-driven segmentation. Using the large-scale CT-RATE dataset, we decompose the diagnostic reports into fine-grained, organ-level descriptions using large language models for multi-granular contrastive learning. We evaluate our OpenVocabCT on downstream segmentation tasks across 14 public datasets and 1 institutional dataset for organ and tumor segmentation, demonstrating the superior performance of our model compared to existing methods.

41421702,"Coevolutionary Analysis of Evidence and Recommendations in STEMI Clinical Practice Guidelines: A 33-Year Meta-Research Study of ACC, AHA, and ESC.","<h4>Background</h4>ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is considered the main cause of mortality and morbidity for decades globally. Regularly, cardiology-related medical organizations publish clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to support healthcare professionals in the diagnosis, management, and prevention of future cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, the level of evidence (LOE) and classification of recommendations (CORs) endorsing STEMI-associated CPGs recommendations have not been systematically appraised.<h4>Purpose</h4>This meta-research study evaluated and described the CORs and LOE over time for STEMI guidelines endorsed by the American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC), from 1990-2023.<h4>Data sources</h4>We initially searched on PubMed® and AHA/ACC/ESC electronic repositories to obtain STEMI-related CPGs, published from 1990-2023, including their immediate predecessors.<h4>Study selection</h4>Guidelines related to acute in-hospital STEMI management were included; recommendations related to unstable angina/Non-STEMI were excluded.<h4>Data extraction</h4>Data management was performed by two content experts. Recommendations on pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (PI and NPI, respectively) were extracted ipsilaterally, further processed and coded based on thematic analysis fundamentals. Recommendations recordings associated with each recommendation were maintained as the primary guideline publication without team's specialist judgement. Pharmacological-related recommendations were categorized in accordance with the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology. Changes in the proportion and LOE were evaluated longitudinally, using chi-square test (x<sup>2</sup>). Data visualization included heatmaps, linear plots, and Sankey diagrams.<h4>Data synthesis</h4>Twenty-six guidelines (2,139 STEMI-specific recommendations) were evaluated. We observed an overall predominance of recommendations relying on moderate (proportion of 30·1% of LOE-B recommendations) or low (proportion of 28·9% of LOE-C recommendations) quality of evidence over the 33-year span. Only 17·7% of processed recommendations were based on high quality of evidence. Pharmacological interventions were more often LOE-A compared with NPI (21·5% versus 13·8%; p-value < 0·05). Most abstracted PI related to anticoagulants and dual anti-platelet therapies, while the most frequent category of NPI were related to percutaneous coronary interventions and implantable cardiac devices. Two consecutive guidelines comparison revealed that LOE and COR assigned to corresponding recommendation were minimal.<h4>Limitations</h4>Restriction to only AHA/ACC/ESC guidelines and primary focus on acute in-hospital management recommendations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>STEMI-related recommendations from foremost cardiology societies worldwide have largely relied on moderate/low-quality evidence, with slight changes over time. Novel ways to generate high quality evidence in a more pragmatic and efficient fashion are warranted.<h4>Primary funding source</h4>None PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: Open Science Frame under OSF.IO/BRD58.",Borges Do Nascimento IJ; Lopes RD; Malveira De Lima MV; Itaborahy MF; Fanaroff AC; Sathian B; Thiele H; Ramos Nascimento B,"Université Paris Cité and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, Inserm, INRAe, Centre de Recherche en Épidémiologie et Statistiques (CRESS), Hôpital Hôtel Dieu, Paris, 75004, France; Departmento de Clínica Médica, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 21941-617, Brazil; Serviço de Cardiologia, Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, 21941-617, Brazil; Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States of America.

41422225,Indocyanine green fluorescence-guided perfusion vs. standard assessment to prevent clinical anastomotic leak after colorectal resection: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with site-specific subgroup analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Anastomotic leak remains a devastating complication after colorectal resection, with an incidence rate of 3-19%, and has profound impacts on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography enables real-time visualization of anastomotic perfusion; however, randomized evidence regarding its efficacy in preventing clinical leaks has yielded conflicting results across recent multicenter trials.<h4>Methods</h4>We systematically searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Scopus through October 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICG fluorescence-guided perfusion assessment with standard white-light assessment during colorectal anastomosis. The primary outcome was clinical anastomotic leakage (grade B/C). The secondary outcomes included reinterventions, complications, mortality, conversion, operative time, and length of stay. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. The systematic review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251162495) before data extraction and analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Seven RCTs enrolling 4577 patients (2287 ICG fluorescence, 2290 standard assessment) met the inclusion criteria. ICG fluorescence-guided perfusion assessment significantly reduced clinical anastomotic leaks compared to the standard assessment (odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.86; p = 0.0009; I²=0%; moderate-certainty evidence), translating to 29 fewer leaks per 1,000 procedures. No significant differences were observed in re-interventions (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65-1.25; low certainty), composite complications (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-1.01; low certainty), 90-day mortality (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-1.01; low certainty), conversions to open surgery (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.83-1.61; low certainty), operative time (mean difference + 2.37 min, 95% CI - 4.22 to + 8.97; low certainty), or hospital length of stay (mean difference + 0.01 days, 95% CI - 0.41 to + 0.42; low certainty).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Moderate-certainty evidence demonstrates that ICG fluorescence-guided perfusion assessment reduces clinical anastomotic leaks by approximately 31% after colorectal resection, supporting its adoption to enhance intraoperative decision making and improve patient outcomes, despite no significant impact on other perioperative endpoints. However, the absence of standardized, objective criteria for ICG interpretation, accounting for patient-specific factors such as cardiovascular disease and obesity, remains a critical barrier to achieving reproducible clinical benefits and represents an essential priority for future validation studies.",Mirza W; Iqbal H; Saeeda Y; Khan ME; Khan A; Moeen-Ud-Din MB; Khan HM; Chatha HN; Dadan S,"Shifa College of Medicine, Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University, Sector H-8/4, Islamabad, Pakistan. wajahatmirza.clinicalresearch@gmail.com.",World journal of surgical oncology,2025-12-20,10.1186/s12957-025-04163-9,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Meta-analysis; Grade; Indocyanine green; Randomized controlled trial; Colorectal Surgery; Anastomotic Leak; Perfusion Assessment; Fluorescence Angiography
41406280,Advanced Deep Learning Framework for Cancer Cell Morphological Analysis and Tumor Mutational Burden Prediction From Histopathological Images.,"Cancer cell morphological analysis represents a fundamental approach for understanding tumor behavior and predicting treatment responses in precision oncology. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a critical biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy, traditionally measured through expensive and time-consuming whole-exome sequencing methods. This study introduces CellMorphNet, an innovative deep learning architecture integrating cancer cell morphological feature extraction with advanced attention mechanisms to predict TMB levels from routine histopathological images. Our framework employs a novel cellular deconvolution structure that separates histological staining components, enabling enhanced visualization of cancer cell characteristics crucial for TMB assessment. The model incorporates a hierarchical routing attention mechanism that selectively focuses on morphologically relevant cellular regions, reducing computational complexity while improving prediction accuracy. The CellMorphNet architecture consists of a four-stage hierarchical pyramid structure, where each stage contains morphological pooling layers and specialized CellMorph blocks for extracting cancer cell features. Experimental validation across five independent training runs on TCGA datasets demonstrated that CellMorphNet achieved superior performance in binary classification with AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall values of 99.2$\pm$ 0.3%, 96.8$\pm$ 0.4%, 97.1$\pm$ 0.4%, and 96.5$\pm$ 0.5%, respectively. For ternary classification, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores reached 96.8$\pm$ 0.4%, 96.3$\pm$ 0.5%, 96.5$\pm$ 0.4%, and 96.4$\pm$ 0.5%, respectively. Statistical tests confirmed the superiority of CellMorphNet over existing methods ($p< 0.001$), establishing this approach as a cost-effective alternative to molecular sequencing for clinical decision-making in cancer immunotherapy.",Xu X; Yu F; Basheer S; Kan Z,,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2025-12-17,10.1109/jbhi.2025.3645411,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41401443,Exploring the Fit Between the Outputs of Freely Available Medication Adherence Apps and Users' Needs: Mixed Methods Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Medication nonadherence is a significant barrier to therapy success. Smartphone apps represent reasonable tools for simple adherence-enhancing interventions. Many adherence apps are available in app stores with diverse content, quality, and outputs. We define ""output of an adherence app"" as the processing and visualization of data recorded by the user and related to adherence. In 2016, Santo et al defined 5 desirable features in the output of adherence apps: tracking history, charts, statistics, rewards, and an exportable file. With this, a reference point to evaluate outputs of adherence apps was delivered. Identifying and fulfilling users' needs are essential when developing an adherence app for patients' self-management and professional adherence services, such as therapy support provided by health care professionals (HCPs).<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to investigate the smartphone app market regarding desirable features in the outputs, explore the users' needs, and evaluate the concordance.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched for smartphone adherence apps in the 2 largest commercial app repositories by using keywords. Search results were screened for eligibility by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible, freely available apps were tested regarding desirable features in their output. We conducted 2 focus groups and a cross-sectional online survey to explore users' needs. Survey participants rated their desire for features on a 7-point Likert scale. Focus groups were analyzed using the previously reported framework method. Descriptive statistics were calculated by median and IQR or mean and SD. We compared survey subgroups with a 2-tailed t test. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>We screened 80 apps for eligibility and included 9 in our analyses. All desirable features were present, with tracking history being the most frequent feature (in 8/9 apps). Other desirable features were observed in 3 or fewer of the apps. Eight individuals participated in the 2 focus groups. During the focus groups, a total of 13 categories of desired features emerged. All 5 desirable features were rated as important in adherence apps. Three additional features were mentioned: (1) professional feedback regarding therapy or intake course, (2) additional recommendations based on intake course, and (3) option to discuss the data with an HCP. A total of 42 individuals participated in the online survey. Tracking history was the most desired (mean rating of 5.29) and rewards the least desired feature (mean rating of 2.81) in the output. There was ambivalence regarding professional feedback, statistics, and charts. Participants with or without regular medication use showed no significant differences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The outputs delivered by freely available smartphone adherence apps only partly match users' needs. Users showed a special interest in the interpretation of their data with an HCP. Therefore, adherence apps cannot substitute for the HCP but can be used to enhance current patient care.",Messner K; Sutter V; Allemann S; Arnet I,"Department Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2025-12-16,10.2196/68919,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Implementation; Needs Assessment; Medication Adherence; Mhealth; Outputs; Users’ Perspective; Desirable Features
41420706,Accurate localization of deep brain stimulation electrode contacts using extended Hounsfield unit computed tomography.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Accurate localization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes is critical for effective therapy. Conventional CT is widely used postoperatively but fails to delineate individual electrode contacts due to metallic artifacts. This study aimed to evaluate extended Hounsfield unit (EHU) CT - using an expanded scale up to 40,000 HU- for accurate localization of individual DBS electrode contacts.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective study included 29 patients (58 DBS electrodes) who underwent DBS implantation. Postoperative imaging comprised both conventional CT and EHU-CT reconstructions. Two independent raters localized electrode contacts using a standardized protocol. Inter-method and inter-rater agreement were quantified using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Euclidean distances. Qualitative assessments of contact visibility were also performed.<h4>Results</h4>Quantitative analysis showed near-perfect agreement between EHU-CT and conventional CT (ICC ≈ 1), with high inter-rater consistency. However, qualitative evaluation revealed superior contact visualization with EHU-CT: all contacts were clearly identifiable in 100% of cases, while conventional CT consistently failed to distinguish individual contacts due to blooming artifacts. Conventional CT localizations were also sensitive to window-level adjustments, particularly along the z-axis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>EHU-CT enables consistent and direct visualization of individual DBS contacts and provides a robust alternative to conventional CT. Its reduced sensitivity to display settings and improved interpretability may enhance intra-operative decision-making and postoperative programming, supporting more reliable DBS workflows.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Accurate deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode localization is crucial for optimal intra-operative adjustments and outcomes, yet conventional CT is hindered by metallic artifacts limiting individual contact visualization. Findings Extended Hounsfield unit (EHU)-CT and conventional CT showed near-perfect agreement in electrode localization, but EHU-CT provided clearly superior visualization of individual electrode contacts. Clinical relevance By enabling direct visualization of individual contacts through an extended Hounsfield scale, EHU-CT can improve intra-operative decision-making and postoperative programming, potentially enhancing DBS localization accuracy and patient outcomes.",Kremer NI; van Hulzen ALJ; Tamasi K; Oterdoom DLM; Drost G; van Laar T; van Dijk JMC,"Department of Neurosurgery, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. n.i.kremer@umcg.nl.",European radiology,2025-12-20,10.1007/s00330-025-12179-8,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Artifacts; Deep brain stimulation; Movement Disorders; Tomography (X-ray Computed)
41161323,Single-use versus reusable gastroscopes for the initial assessment of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a prospective randomized noninferiority trial.,"Recently, several single-use endoscopes have been developed; however, their clinical performance remains unclear. This trial aimed to compare the performance of single-use gastroscopes (SUGs) with that of reusable gastroscopes (RUGs), in the context of emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).Patients with suspected UGIB requiring EGD between March 2023 and April 2024 were randomized to undergo EGD with either an SUG or an RUG. The primary outcome was complete assessment of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract for the presence of a bleeding site.148 patients were included. A complete assessment of the UGI tract was achieved in 72/74 patients with the SUG and in 71/74 patients with the RUG (97.3% vs. 95.9%; <i>P</i> < 0.001); however, the bleeding site was identified significantly more frequently in the RUG group (83.8% vs. 68.9%; <i>P</i> = 0.03). The need for a therapeutic intervention did not differ between the groups (55.4% vs. 50.0%; <i>P</i> = 0.51). Five crossovers to an RUG occurred, largely owing to better visualization and user experience.SUGs are noninferior to RUGs in the complete assessment of the UGI tract in patients with signs of UGIB; however, a significantly higher rate of bleeding site identification, superior visualization quality, greater acceptance by endoscopists, and a trend toward more effective therapeutic performance was achieved with RUGs.",Römmele C; Ayoub M; Scheppach MW; Muzalyova A; Wanzl J; Tadic V; Braun G; Weber T; Roser D; Nagl S; Messmann H; Ebigbo A,"Gastroenterology, University Hospital Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.",Endoscopy,2025-12-17,10.1055/a-2735-1114,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41417127,Optimal MRI protocol for acute unilateral vestibulopathy: 3D-fsFLAIR vs 3D-fsT1WI at multiple post-contrast time points.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To compare three-dimensional fat-suppressed fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D-fsFLAIR) with three-dimensional fat-suppressed T1-weighted imaging (3D-fsT1WI) for detecting superior vestibular nerve (SVN) enhancement in acute unilateral vestibulopathy (AUVP), and to determine the optimal post-contrast imaging time.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This single-center prospective cohort study enrolled consecutive patients who underwent 3D-fsFLAIR and 3D-fsT1WI at 0 min, 15 min, 1 h, and 4 h post-contrast between April 2022 and May 2023. Two blinded radiologists independently scored asymmetric enhancement of the SVN on both sequences and, using 3D-fsFLAIR alone, measured the SVN signal intensity ratio (SIR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) quantitatively while also qualitatively grading asymmetric inner-ear enhancement. Statistical analyses employed generalized linear mixed models, nested linear mixed-effects models, and Friedman tests.<h4>Results</h4>The study included 54 AUVP patients (mean age, 44.87 ± 11.47 years; 29 men). 3D-fsFLAIR yielded significantly higher asymmetric SVN enhancement scores than 3D-fsT1WI at every time point, with both sequences achieving peak visualization at 1 h (all p < 0.001). Quantitative analysis on 3D-fsFLAIR showed significantly elevated SIR and SNR in the affected SVN at 1 h and 4 h compared with 0 min and 15 min (all p < 0.001), with no significant difference between the 1 h and 4 h. Similarly, asymmetric inner-ear enhancement scores were greater at 1 h and 4 h than in the early phases (all p < 0.05), but plateaued after 1 h (p = 0.29).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The 1 h delayed 3D-fsFLAIR protocol optimized AUVP evaluation, offered superior lesion detection, and clinical practicality.<h4>Key points</h4>Question The optimal sequence selection between 3D-fsFLAIR and 3D-fsT1WI for AUVP evaluation and the ideal post-contrast timing remain to be determined. Findings The optimal protocol for AUVP evaluation is the 1 h post-contrast delayed 3D-fsFLAIR sequence, which provides superior lesion detection capability and enhanced clinical practicality. Clinical relevance The 1 h delayed 3D-fsFLAIR protocol provides optimal visualization of vestibular nerve and inner ear abnormalities in AUVP, enabling more confident clinical assessment without requiring longer delays (e.g., 4 h).",Hu N; Li J; Zhao H; Yue G; Wang L; Pylypenko D; Xu T; Su S; Li C,"Department of Radiology, Shandong Provincial ENT Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.",European radiology,2025-12-19,10.1007/s00330-025-12220-w,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Vestibular nerve; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Vestibular Neuronitis; Ear-inner
41406190,Tracking Myrosinase Regulation across Multiscale Interactions with Fluorescent Glucosinolates.,"The conversion of glucosinolates (GSLs) into chemopreventive isothiocyanates (ITCs) primarily relies on plant myrosinase (MYR) or specific bacteria. MYR dynamics are deeply involved in plant defense systems, gut microbiota metabolism, and complex interactions and regulation across species. A set of activity-based probes was developed to track MYR in vivo by biomimicking natural GSL with robust sensitivity and selectivity. The dynamics and heterogeneous distribution of MYR in distinct sections and species were captured via fluorescence imaging of live plants. Specifically, under herbivore challenge to leaves, a systemic, long-distance upregulation of MYR activity in root tissues has confirmed cross-species MYR regulation in plant defense. Furthermore, for the first time, quantitative visualization of the dynamic metabolic competition of GSL and sugar has confirmed the metabolic priority of sugar in gut microbiota and colonized zebrafish in vivo. The competitive metabolism is involved in the crosstalk during cross-species microbes and host-microbe interactions. Tracking MYR regulation across species by the designed probes has offered rich insights into the dynamic interplay among diet, microbiota, and host health.",Tang Y; Wang T; Li C; Li S; Zhang J; Tan D; Cui X,"Department of Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, P.

41395778,EXPRESS: Comparative Cadaveric Study of Needle and Conventional Arthroscopy Techniques of the Feline Stifle Joint.,"ObjectivesArthroscopy is a well-established diagnostic and therapeutic method for canine stifle pathology; however, its use in cats remains underreported. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of conventional arthroscopy (CA) and needle arthroscopy (NA) in feline stifles.MethodsPaired stifles from 20 feline cadavers without clinical or radiographic stifle pathology were randomly assigned to two groups: CA (1.9 mm, 30°) and NA (1.9 mm, 0°). Arthroscopy was performed by a board-certified surgeon using a three-portal method and predefined evaluation sequence, ending with medial meniscus assessment. In 10 randomly selected stifles from each group, an extra-articular distractor was applied before medial meniscus evaluation. Procedure duration, visualization quality, surgical difficulty, and cartilage lesions were recorded. Periarticular and iatrogenic articular cartilage injuries (IACIs) were assessed via dissection and India ink staining.ResultsNA yielded a lower mean surgical difficulty score, shorter mean arthroscopy duration, and a higher rate of complete medial meniscus visualization than CA. No significant differences were found in absolute IACI (CA with distraction [CA-D]: 4.4 ± 2.8 mm²; CA without distraction [CA-nD]: 5.4 ± 2.4 mm²; NA with distraction [NA-D]: 3.9 ± 2.0 mm²; NA without distraction [NA-nD] 3.6 ± 2.4 mm²) or in percent surface area affected (CA-D: 1.0 ± 0.6%; CA-nD: 1.3 ± 0.6%; NA-D 0.9 ± 0.4%; NA-nD 0.9 ± 0.6%).Conclusions and relevanceStifle arthroscopy was feasible using both conventional and needle arthroscopes in feline cadavers without stifle pathology and may be considered a minimally invasive tool for diagnosing feline stifle disease. NA in smaller patients may offer advantages over CA in terms of feasibility and procedure duration. Although not statistically significant, NA tended to result in fewer IACIs.

41409024,Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: advances and future directions in management.,"Numerous clinical guidelines have been developed for the management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB), yet significant variations exist among the recommendations. This review summarizes the most recent evidence on NVUGIB management, structured across four key stages: pre-endoscopic management, endoscopic treatment, post-endoscopic care, and the identification and management of refractory bleeding. In the pre-endoscopic phase, several risk-scoring systems have been developed to predict mortality. A restrictive transfusion strategy, with a threshold of 7 to 8 g/dL, is now recommended for most patients. Pre-endoscopic administration of intravenous erythromycin also improves visualization during endoscopy. A wide array of endoscopic hemostasis techniques is available, with the choice of method depending on the underlying cause of bleeding. When endoscopic hemostasis fails, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is generally preferred over surgery as the second-line intervention. Once hemostasis is achieved, high-dose acid suppression is essential, and the risk of rebleeding should be assessed. For patients who experience rebleeding, repeat endoscopic therapy is recommended as the first-line approach. However, determining the optimal timing for TAE remains a challenge. Because of the heterogeneity of clinical presentations, NVUGIB management should be personalized. Further research is needed to establish evidence-based, individualized treatment strategies.",Hatta W; Ogata Y; Chiba T; Tanno N; Kawabe M; Kayada K; Hatayama Y; Saito M; Imatani A; Koike T; Masamune A,"Division of Gastroenterology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.",Clinical endoscopy,2025-12-17,10.5946/ce.2025.202,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Mortality; Endoscopy; hemorrhage
41415553,The research perspectives and frontiers on radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: a bibliometric analysis and systematic review.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Research into radiotherapy(RT) for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) has significantly advanced, underscoring its critical role in systemic therapy. However, there remains a notable lack of quantitative and analytical studies specifically addressing RT in the context of HCC. This study aims to evaluate the evolution of RT research and provide a comprehensive analysis of RT studies using bibliometric citation analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>A literature search was conducted on July 2, 2024, to extract relevant publications from the Science Citation Index-Expanded(SCIE) of the Web of Science Core Collection(WoSCC), spanning the years 2014 to 2023. Bibliometric and quantitative assessments of the collected publications were performed using visualization tools such as CiteSpace and VOSviewer.<h4>Results</h4>The research identified 822 manuscripts authored by 4681 researchers from 1083 institutions across 17 countries, published in 225 journals, and involving 16183 co-cited references from 2282 journals. The United States led in publication volume with 147 articles (17.9%), showing close collaboration with Canada and China. Key areas of focus included the use of RT for HCC with portal vein tumor thrombosis and its combination with transarterial chemoembolization for advanced HCC treatment, which have garnered significant global interest. Recently, particle therapy and the integration of targeted therapies and immunotherapy with RT have emerged as critical themes and frontiers in this research domain.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study provides a comprehensive analysis and summary of the current research trends and emerging insights regarding RT in HCC. RT combined with transarterial chemoembolization(TACE) for portal vein tumor thrombosis(PVTT) in HCC has received widespread attention, while particle therapy and combination targeted immunotherapies with RT are essential topics and emerging areas of interest.

41417119,Photon-counting CT in neuroradiology: a comprehensive SWOT analysis.,"Photon-counting-detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) is a disruptive technology in neuroradiology, as evidenced by the unprecedented excitement surrounding its potential clinical applications and the field's growing number of publications. By employing photon-counting detectors capable of capturing information about individual photons and measuring their energy levels, PCD-CT offers benefits over conventional energy-integrating detector (EID) CT, including a higher contrast-to-noise ratio, reduced metal artifacts, improved spatial resolution, and decreased radiation and iodine dose necessary to achieve the highest resolution images seen to date. The currently available whole-body clinical PCD-CT scanner applications in neuroradiology range from optimized bone assessment to discrimination of fine details in neurovascular evaluation. However, intrinsic barriers such as cost and technical complexity, and external factors, including a lack of protocol standardization and direct competition with other technologies, hinder the widespread adoption of PCD-CT. To analyze the current state of evidence for PCD-CT in neuroradiology, we conducted a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis, which may help readers and researchers to make a picture of this disruptive technology. KEY POINTS: Question A SWOT analysis of PCD-CT in neuroradiology may be useful to objectively assess its technical strengths, implementation challenges, opportunities, and threats for clinical adoption. Findings Photon-counting detector CT demonstrates superior spatial resolution, reduced artifacts, and lower radiation doses compared to conventional CT, enhancing neuroradiological imaging quality.

41415601,Beyond Ultra-high Frequency: Clinical Feasibility of 10-12 MHz and Portable Ultrasound in Lymphatic Imaging.,"Lymphatic ultrasound has recently emerged as a noninvasive, contrast-free modality for evaluating lymphatic vessels, particularly as a preoperative tool for lymphaticovenous anastomosis. Although high-frequency linear probes (18-20 MHz) are commonly used, their availability may be limited, and ultra-high-frequency probes (≥30 MHz) are limited by poor tissue penetration. This study investigated the feasibility of using lower frequency linear probes (10-12 MHz), including a portable 10-MHz device, to visualize lymphatic vessels in patients with extremity lymphedema. A total of 24 limbs from 13 female patients were examined. Dilated lymphatic vessels were first identified using an 18-MHz probe, then reevaluated with either a 12- or 10-MHz probe. Among 44 sites, 86.4% of lymphatic vessels detected with the 18-MHz probe were also visible with lower frequency probes. Identification was more successful in the lower extremities (89.5%) than in the upper extremities (66.7%). Visualization rates were comparable between the 12- (87.0%) and 10-MHz (85.7%) probes. These findings suggest that lower frequency probes, including portable devices, can adequately visualize lymphatic vessels in most cases. This may facilitate wider adoption of lymphatic ultrasound in general clinical settings and resource-limited environments. However, further studies are needed to evaluate their standalone diagnostic performance and ability to assess lymphatic degeneration, and their limitations in de novo identification should also be acknowledged. Addressing these issues may help optimize probe selection and further expand the clinical utility of lymphatic ultrasound.",Hara H; Mihara M,"From the Department of Lymphatic and Reconstructive Surgery, JR Tokyo General Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

41404649,Mapping Alzheimer's disease heterogeneity with molecular imaging biomarkers.,"<h4>Background</h4>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuropathologically defined by the buildup of misfolded proteins such as extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles. AD also extends beyond these pathological processes, and additional mechanisms such as synaptic dysfunction, microglial activity, astrocytic neuroinflammation play an important role as biomarkers of AD progression. In vivo evaluation and quantification of these molecular processes are possible with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. As disease-modifying therapies are entering clinical use, biomarkers' importance for early diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of the disease increases.<h4>Results</h4>Aβ is the earliest signature of AD which can be measured with PET imaging, followed by tau-PET positivity, which is highly specific and central for staging and longitudinal monitoring. FDG-PET continues to serve as a gold standard for detecting neurodegeneration, challenged by emerging dual-phase PET protocols for amyloid and tau imaging, which integrate perfusion as a measure of neurodegeneration and pathology information in a single session, enhancing diagnostic efficiency. Synaptic density imaging reveals early synaptic loss linked to cognitive performance and decline. Neuroinflammation tracers can visualize microglial and astrocytic activation, contributing to disease onset and progression. Novel PET tracers targeting alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 show great promise for detecting co-pathologies which can contribute to AD clinical heterogeneity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PET imaging has advanced the field by enabling visualization of AD-related changes and providing measurable outcomes for clinical trials and disease-modifying therapies. Imaging of related pathologies can further improve diagnostic accuracy and provide important insights into disease heterogeneity. Moving forward, integrating multiple PET biomarkers into personalized diagnostic approaches will be crucial.",Harput E; Boccalini C; Mathoux G; Prior JO; Testart N; Jreige M; Garibotto V,"Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Innovative Molecular Tracers (NIMTlab), Geneva University Neurocentre and Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.",European journal of clinical investigation,2025-12-17,10.1111/eci.70163,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Alzheimer's disease; Positron emission tomography; Biomarkers; Imaging; Co‐pathologies
41408730,An Ultralong-Circulating Tantalum-Based Computed Tomography Contrast Agent for Vascular Imaging in Large Animals.,"Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a critical tool for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of vascular diseases in clinical practice, but current CT contrast agents fall short of meeting the demands for real-time, long-term, and high-resolution imaging. This study presents an ultra-long-term CTA method enabled by PEGylated ultrasmall tantalum oxide nanoparticles (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-PEG NPs) for accurate imaging evaluation of cardiovascular diseases based on the blood clearance mechanism of NPs. This contrast agent featured exceptional water solubility (800 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>), strong X-ray attenuation, good biocompatibility, and large-scale production ability. With a compact hydrodynamic diameter (∼10 nm) and nearly neutral surface charge, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-PEG NPs exhibited prolonged blood circulation (half-lives of 19.84 h in rats and 18.23 h in rabbits) and an extended imaging window of up to 10 h post-injection. Comparative studies in rat, rabbit, and preclinical porcine models demonstrated that Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-PEG NPs enabled high-resolution, whole-body vascular visualization, and supported accurate diagnosis and postoperative evaluation of vascular stenosis and thrombosis from single administration.

41396685,Optimal pinching technique for recanalization: A retrospective analysis of mechanical thrombectomy in a 3D vessel model.,"ObjectiveAchieving recanalization with the few passes as possible is essential for favorable outcomes in mechanical thrombectomy (MT). However, when recanalization fails, the underlying reasons often remain unclear because device-thrombus interactions cannot be directly visualized during the procedure. We investigated how device maneuver during the pinching technique influences first pass recanalization (FPR).MethodsUsing a 3D silicone cerebrovascular model and swine thrombi, 109 MT procedures were performed by experienced neurointerventionalists under clinical use fluoroscopy, blinded to direct visualization. Real-world procedural videos were retrospectively analyzed to assess the impact of device maneuvers on FPR.ResultsThe pinching technique for non-segmented thrombus was applied in 58 cases. Advancing the aspiration catheter (AC) to achieve thrombus contact occurred in 52 cases, yielding FPR in 44 cases. Pulling the stent retriever (SR) toward the AC after contact was performed in 14 cases, all achieving FPR, compared with 32 of 44 cases without this maneuver. SR deployment after AC-thrombus contact frequently caused proximal AC displacement and loss of thrombus contact.ConclusionIn pinching technique, advancing the AC to ensure thrombus contact, followed by pulling the SR toward the AC before system retrieval, may prevent stretching, facilitate effective pinching, and improve the likelihood of achieving FPR.",Kawamura Y; Honda A; Horikoshi Y; Brouwer P,"Johnson & Johnson K.K.

41412928,FAPI PET imaging value in radiotherapy planning and assessment in head and neck cancers.,"Head and neck cancers (HNCs) represent a heterogeneous group of malignancies, predominantly composed of squamous cell carcinoma. Radiotherapy (RT), either alone or concurrently with chemotherapy, remains a central component of definitive and adjuvant treatment in HNCs. The success of radiotherapy depends on precise target volume delineation, which relies heavily on advanced imaging techniques. Positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is well-established in RT planning workflows and endorsed by international guidelines. Recent advances in molecular imaging using fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) targeting PET tracers offer improved tumor visualization and target delineation with early studies demonstrating more distinct tumor margins and improved diagnostic performance compared with FDG PET in HNCs. These advantages align with the critical need for highly reliable imaging in a disease site where complex anatomy complicates RT delivery. Early findings suggest a promising role for FAPI PET, in refining gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation and complementing current RT workflows. Despite the promising findings, current evidence is limited to small, primarily single-center cohorts, some with heterogeneous tumor subtypes, and the absence of prospective outcome-based validation. In addition, the utility of FAPI PET in post-RT response assessment and the optimal timing of imaging has yet to be clear defined. Rigorous, methodologically well-designed prospective studies are needed to establish the clinical value, prognostic significance, and impact of FAPI PET on radiotherapy outcomes in HNCs.",Shagera QA; Öztürk AA; Pabst KM; Longton E; Machiels JH; Gheysens O; Nuyts S,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, Institut Roi Albert II, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.

41408108,"Metabolic profiling of therapy-induced senescent cancer cells via TPEF, MALDI-MS, and RNA-sequencing.","Despite advances in cancer therapies, treatment failure from resistance and recurrence remains a major clinical challenge. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS), a state of stable cell cycle arrest with sustained metabolic activity, has emerged as a driver of inflammation, tumor persistence, and relapse. However, the heterogeneity of TIS complicates its detection and targeting. Here, we applied a multi-modal strategy to characterize metabolic alterations in senescent cancer cells induced by doxorubicin or γ-irradiation across three tumor cell lines: MCF7, HeLa, and TPC-1. Mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed using MitoTracker and JC-1 staining, while two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy enabled label-free visualization of intracellular NAD(P)H and FAD distribution. Lipid remodeling was evaluated by MALDI mass spectrometry imaging, and RNA sequencing was performed on control, senescent, and engulfing-senescent MCF7 cells to identify differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways. Senescent cells displayed mitochondrial dysfunction, with altered NAD(P)H/FAD distribution and decreased membrane potential. TPEF confirmed redistribution of coenzymes, reflecting redox changes. Lipidomics revealed consistent remodeling, notably involving cardiolipin precursors. Transcriptomic profiling showed engulfing-senescent MCF7 cells possess a distinct signature marked by increased lipid metabolism, endocrine signaling, and cell-cell communication. Overall, our findings reveal conserved and cell type-specific metabolic traits of TIS, highlighting metabolic vulnerabilities for senolytic intervention.",Ghislanzoni S; Padelli F; Niero M; Bertolotti A; Belfiore A; Torelli S; Bresci A; Masella A; Betti S; Polli D; Agnelli L; Bongarzone I,"Department of Diagnostic Innovation, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Via Giacomo Venezian 1, Milan, 20133, Italy.",Scientific reports,2025-12-17,10.1038/s41598-025-32573-y,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Senescence; Breast cancer; Engulfing
41408282,3D-TEE: an essential tool for percutaneous occlusion of atrial septal defects with anomalous band.,"<h4>Background</h4>Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) is a common congenital heart defect, often requiring precise diagnostic evaluation for optimal treatment. The presence of left atrial anomalous band, an anatomical variation, can complicate diagnosis and intervention and may be misinterpreted on 2D imaging. This case highlights the critical role of three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D-TEE) both for pre-procedural anatomical clarification and for intra-procedural guidance, in accurately characterizing ASD morphology, particularly when anomalous band are present, ensuring appropriate device selection and procedural planning.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 25-year-old woman with a history of a cardiac murmur identified during pregnancy presented with occasional palpitations and mild foot swelling. Preoperative two-dimensional echocardiography suggested multiple ASDs, but 3D-TEE revealed a single defect with a mobile anomalous band, with the ASD measuring approximately 24*18 mm in diameter and having a circular shape with smooth, well-defined edges, which altered the procedural approach. A single occluder was successfully deployed, leading to complete closure of the defect without complications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This case emphasizes the superiority of 3D-TEE over conventional imaging in assessing ASD morphology, particularly in the presence of anatomical variations like anomalous band. We emphasize its value not only for accurate device selection and procedural planning but also as a critical teaching tool for operators learning procedural 3D echocardiography guidance. Accurate visualization of the ASD and surrounding structures facilitates optimal device selection and improves clinical outcomes.",Zhang P; Li J; Lv M,"Department of Ultrasound, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, No. 16766 Jingshi Road, Jinan, 250014, China.",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,2025-12-17,10.1186/s13019-025-03771-6,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Atrial septal defect; Three-dimensional Transesophageal Echocardiography; Anomalous Band
41400717,The efficacy of minimally invasive intraoperative ultrasound in endoscopic pituitary surgery.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to evaluate the clinical utility of minimally invasive intraoperative ultrasound as a real-time imaging adjunct during endoscopic endonasal pituitary adenoma surgery. The goal is to determine its effectiveness in tumor localization, identification of critical structures, and detection of residual tumor tissue.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective analysis was conducted on 22 patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery with intraoperative ultrasound at our institution from August 2024 to June 2025. The ultrasound probe was used before dural opening to identify the tumor, normal gland, and adjacent structures, including the internal carotid artery (ICA). After tumor resection, ultrasound was employed to assess residual tumor. Clinical and surgical outcomes, including extent of resection and perioperative complications, were reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>Intraoperative ultrasound enabled clear visualization of the tumor-normal gland interface in both solid and cystic macroadenomas, facilitating safe and precise resection. The technique aided in identification of the ICA during cavernous sinus invasion, reducing vascular injury risk. In cases where tumors were not visible on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intraoperative ultrasound successfully detected the lesions, allowing targeted resection. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 86.4% of cases. The median follow-up was 8 months (range, 3-13 months). There were no new postoperative hormonal deficits. Transient diabetes insipidus occurred in three cases, and all resolved within three months.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Intraoperative ultrasound provides real-time, high-resolution imaging that enhances the precision and safety of endoscopic pituitary surgery. The technique is particularly valuable for tumor localization, identification of critical neurovascular structures, and detection of residual tumor tissue. Further studies are warranted to validate a broader applicability and refine its role in differentiating tumor from normal gland tissue.",Lee MH; Im YH; Shin JH; Lee TK,"Department of Neurosurgery, Uijeongbu St. Mary's Hospital, School of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea. minho919.lee@catholic.ac.kr.",Pituitary,2025-12-16,10.1007/s11102-025-01587-0,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Intraoperative Ultrasound; Endoscopic Pituitary Surgery; Internal Carotid Artery Identification; Mri-negative Pituitary Adenoma; Tumor–normal Gland Interface; Residual Tumor Detection
41422456,Single-Molecule approach to quantify sperm single-stranded DNA damage using the novel sperm repair-assisted damage detection (SRADD) assay. ,"Sperm DNA damage is linked to male infertility and poor reproductive outcome. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) damage in sperm is the most common type of damage yet is not specifically targeted by the commonly used DNA damage assays. This study aimed to quantitatively detect sperm ssDNA damage using a novel, direct method. The sperm repair-assisted damage detection (SRADD) assay is a single-molecule technique that uses specific repair enzymes to excise damaged segments and incorporates fluorescently labeled nucleotides, enabling visualization and quantification of the damage. We assessed ssDNA damage in sperm donors following induced damage using varying concentrations of H2O2. The assay was evaluated for sensitivity, repeatability, and reproducibility. SRADD results were compared with the direct TUNEL assay and the indirect sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) assay. SRADD demonstrated high inter-slide reproducibility (ICC = 0.95). Sensitivity was confirmed by quantifying induced damage in a dose-dependent manner (0.5, 1, 1.5 mM of H2O2), demonstrating mean damage ratios of 1.06, 2.16, and 4.83 relative to control, respectively. Baseline damage levels exhibited strong positive correlation with increased induced damage (r = 0.91, p < 0.001). Analysis of healthy sperm donors (n = 59) revealed that 8.5% of men with normal sperm parameters presented with high ssDNA damage levels. SRADD had a moderate correlation with SCD assay and no correlation with conventional semen parameters and TUNEL assay. The SRADD assay quantifies sperm ssDNA with high sensitivity and can process dozens of samples simultaneously, making it valuable for andrology and toxicology research and potentially useful in clinical settings such as sperm banks and male-infertility assessment.

Dermoscopy, including ultraviolet (UV) mode, can help distinguish disease-specific patterns.<h4>Objective</h4>To compare dermoscopic and UV features of early-stage MF, Pso, and AD.<h4>Methods</h4>In this prospective cohort study, 159 patients (MF: 55, Pso: 53, AD: 51) were examined with dermoscopy and UV mode. Vascular patterns, scale features, background color, structureless areas, and vessel density per mm<sup>2</sup> were analyzed. Group differences were assessed with chi-square/Fisher's exact tests or ANOVA/Welch ANOVA, using Bonferroni/Games-Howell corrections.<h4>Results</h4>MF showed linear and spermatozoa-like vessels, scaling along skin furrows, focal structureless areas, and the lowest vessel density. Pso was defined by uniformly distributed dotted vessels on a bright-red background with diffuse scaling and the highest vessel density. AD showed mainly dotted vessels with additional linear vessels, along with yellow-orange scale, ulceration, dystrophic hairs, and intermediate vessel density. UV imaging improved visualization of structureless areas and scaling edges.<h4>Limitations</h4>Single-centre design, modest sample size, and restriction to early stages may limit generalizability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Dermoscopy with UV mode shows distinct features in MF, Pso, and AD.

41411850,The potential of a coronary artery-specific deep learning CT reconstruction algorithm for improvement in image quality of abdominal CT angiography with special reference to small arterial visibility.,"<h4>Background</h4>/Introduction: We sought to clarify the potential of Precise IQ Engine (PIQE) for the visualization of small arteries in abdominal computed tomography angiography (CTA).<h4>Methods</h4>CT images scanned with a 320-multidetector row CT were generated using four reconstruction methods: Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction 3D (AIDR 3D), Forward projected model-based Iterative Reconstruction SoluTion (FIRST), Advanced intelligent Clear-IQ Engine (AiCE), and PIQE. Phantom study: We evaluated spatial resolution via the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the slit phantom assessment. We also measured the noise power spectrum (NPS) and CT number to evaluate image noise.<h4>Clinical study</h4>Abdominal CTA images from five renal donor candidates were used to evaluate the visibility of four small abdominal arteries per person. The differences in visibility scores evaluated by two radiologists were analyzed using Sheffe's multiple comparison method.<h4>Results</h4>The 10 % values of MTF were 0.54 for AIDR 3D, 0.67 for FIRST, 0.66 for AiCE, and 0.66 for PIQE. In the slit phantom assessment, FIRST, AiCE, and PIQE showed no clear difference in attenuation profiling curves, whereas the maximum spatial resolution for AIDR 3D was the worst. The NPS of FIRST was the highest, whereas that of PIQE was the lowest for the low spatial frequency range. The standard deviation of CT number with PIQE was the lowest, whereas that of FIRST was the highest.

40825662,Advanced imaging of corneal neovascularisation with a novel swept-source AS-OCTA system.,"<h4>Aims</h4>To explore the clinical application of a novel swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography angiography (AS-OCTA) system for imaging corneal neovascularisation (CoNV), assessing limbal vasculature and detecting short-term vascular changes following pharmacologic vasoconstriction.<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional observational study included 20 eyes: 10 with clinically diagnosed CoNV of various aetiologies and 10 healthy controls. Each eye underwent AS-OCTA imaging using the BMizar 400kHz Full-Range Swept-Source OCT system at baseline and after administration of 10% phenylephrine (PE). FlowArea (mm<sup>2</sup>) was automatically calculated across predefined circular regions of interest (ROIs) encompassing the cornea, limbus and episclera. In corneal and limbal ROIs, en face images were segmented into three depth layers: total (epithelium to endothelium), superficial (epithelium to 150 µm) and deep (150 µm to endothelium).<h4>Results</h4>CoNV eyes exhibited significantly higher total and deep corneal FlowArea compared with controls (p=0.0002 and p=0.0005, respectively). Post PE, a significant reduction in FlowArea was observed in the total and deep corneal layers of CoNV eyes (p=0.006 and p=0.009, respectively), and in the limbal region of both groups, with significant reductions observed in CoNV and controls (p=0.006 and p=0.003, respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This AS-OCTA platform enabled high-resolution, depth-resolved visualization of CoNV and revealed vascular changes following topical vasoconstriction. The extended field of view allowed simultaneous assessment of corneal, limbal and episcleral vasculature within a single scan session, supporting its potential role in both diagnostic evaluation and longitudinal monitoring of anterior segment diseases.",Lucchino L; Vaccaro S; Airaldi M; Forbice E; Moramarco A; Lambiase A; Fontana L; Semeraro F; Romano V,"Eye Unit, University of Brescia Department of Medical-Surgical Specialties Radiological Sciences and Public Health, Brescia, Lombardy, Italy.",The British journal of ophthalmology,2025-12-15,10.1136/bjo-2025-327973,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cornea; Imaging; Conjunctiva; Neovascularisation
41405283,Smartphone-assisted PEI@Eu-MOF lateral flow immunosensor for dual-modal POC detection of carbendazim.,"Sensitive detection of carbendazim (CBZ), a widely monitored bactericidal pesticide globally, is critical to reduce risks to human health. In this study, Eu ions were embedded into a rigid metal-organic framework (MOF), to prepare Eu-MOF as a fluorescence signal source, which was subsequently post-modified with polyethyleneimine (PEI) for efficient coupling with anti-CBZ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). On this basis, a PEI@Eu-MOF-mAbs fluorescent probe-based lateral flow immunosensor (LFIS) was developed for CBZ analysis, enabling dual-mode detection: rapid visual qualitative observation by the naked eye and intelligent fluorescence quantitative analysis by using a smartphone. PEI modification not only effectively improved the zeta potential, fluorescence intensity, quantum yield, and biological coupling ability of the Eu-MOF to mAbs, but also significantly enhanced the stability and anti-interference performance of PEI@Eu-MOF. The introduction of PEI@Eu-MOF-mAbs probes characterized by strong fluorescence emission, long fluorescence lifetime, and low background interference, markedly improved the detection sensitivity of the LFIS platform for trace CBZ. Under optimal conditions, the detection limit for smartphone-assisted fluorescence analysis was as low as 1.3 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> with a wide linear detection range of 0.25-125 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> for CBZ. The recoveries in spiked <i>Panax notoginseng</i> samples were 93.40-106.0% with RSD <1.69%, indicating outstanding reliability of the newly developed LFIS platform for accurate detection of CBZ. In comparison with seven other common pesticides, CBZ produced significantly weakened and stable fluorescence, indicating good specificity and stability of the developed platform over 4 weeks. Compared with current analytical methods, the smartphone-assisted PEI@Eu-MOF-mAbs dual-modal LFIS platform exhibited advantages of simple construction, easy operation, rapid response, obvious visualization to the naked eye, and intelligent quantitative analysis, highlighting its broad application potential for rapid screening and accurate point-of-care detection of CBZ in a large number of foods and agricultural products.",Li L; Lei D; Song P; Xu Q; Huang L; Ma X; Zhou L; Zhang P; Kong W,"State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China.",The Analyst,2025-12-17,10.1039/d5an01112d,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41405029,Site-Specific [&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]-Labeled Nanobody Tracer for SPECT Imaging of P2X7 Expression in Atherosclerotic Plaques.,"Purinergic receptor P2X7 has been considered as a potential new target for detecting and treating high-risk plaque. Nanobodies are the smallest antibody fragments with high antigen binding ability and specificity, which are well-suited for radionuclide imaging. The present study aimed to develop a novel P2X7-targeted nanobody SPECT tracer and to investigate its potential for identification of atherosclerotic plaque (AP). The anti-P2X7 nanobody 1c81 was site-specifically conjugated with [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-HYNIC-GGGC via sortase A-mediated transpeptidation to prepare [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-1c81. Saturation binding experiments and cell-binding assays were performed to evaluate their affinity and specificity. Biodistribution studies in C57 mice were conducted at 0.5, 1, and 2 h postinjection (p.i.), and SPECT/CT imaging was performed in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> (high-fat diet) and C57 mice (normal diet) at 2 h p.i, respectively. Specific binding was validated by blocking studies (coinjection of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-1c81 with excess unlabeled 1c81) in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Target-to-background ratio (TBR) was calculated for AP at aortic arch. The harvested aortas were analyzed by autoradiography, Oil Red O lipid staining, and immunofluorescence staining (CD68, P2X7) to correlate tracer uptake with AP characteristics. To further validate the clinical relevance, human coronary endarterectomy (CE) specimens were analyzed for P2X7 and CD68 expression using immunohistochemistry. [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-1c81 was synthesized with 53.77 ± 0.06% radiochemical yield, > 95% purity, 11.13 ± 2.78 MBq/nmol molar activity, and a binding dissociation constant of 6.38 nM. Biodistribution showed rapid clearance from the blood and normal organs except the kidneys. SPECT imaging at 2 h p.i. revealed clear aortic arch visualization, with significantly higher TBR in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to both C57 and blocking groups (4.49 ± 1.88 vs 0.96 ± 0.64, <i>P</i> = 0.012; 4.49 ± 1.88 vs 1.40 ± 0.28, <i>P</i> = 0.017). Autoradiography further confirmed specific tracer accumulation in APs, colocalizing with Oil Red O-positive lipid-rich regions. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining validated high P2X7 receptor expression in both mouse AP aortic valve sections and human CE specimens, which was colocalized with CD68<sup>+</sup> inflammatory cells, confirming the clinical relevance of P2X7 as an imaging target for inflammation of AP. [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-1c81 exhibited specific binding to the P2X7 receptor in AP <i>in vivo</i>. It may serve as a novel P2X7-targeted SPECT tracer to detect AP, with promising applications in clinical risk stratification and treatment response monitoring.",Hu B; Mou T; Wang J; Gao M; Gao X; Yun M; Tian Y; Yu Y; Jia H; Zhang X,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, Molecular Imaging Lab, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100029, China.",Molecular pharmaceutics,2025-12-17,10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5c01207,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Atherosclerotic plaque; Inflammation; P2x7; Nanobody; Spect Imaging; [99Mtc]tc-1c81
41417153,Posterior capsular opacification requiring Nd:YAG capsulotomy after ENOVA GF3 hydrophobic monofocal IOL implantation.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To evaluate the incidence, timing, and clinical characteristics of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) and Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy after uneventful cataract surgery with implantation of the ENOVA GF3 single-piece hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL).<h4>Methods</h4>In this retrospective study, the medical records of patients with a minimum of 6 months follow-up who underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsification with in-the-bag implantation of the ENOVA GF3 hydrophobic monofocal IOL between January 2022 and December 2024 were reviewed. Standardized phacoemulsification was performed by a single surgeon, including posterior capsule polishing and verification of capsulorhexis-optic overlap. Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive outcomes, and slit-lamp findings were recorded. Nd:YAG capsulotomy was performed when BCVA declined to 20/50 or worse or when central PCO impaired visual function or fundus visualization. The primary outcomes were the rates of PCO and Nd:YAG capsulotomy and the time intervals from surgery to PCO detection and capsulotomy.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 151 eyes of 150 patients with mean age of 65.4±9.2 years were included. Significant improvement was observed in both uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity at all postoperative visits (p 0.05). Postoperative refractive outcomes showed stability toward emmetropia with progressive reduction in spherical and cylindrical error (p 0.05). PCO developed in 5 eyes (3.3%). Of these, 3 cases (60%) were identified at postoperative month 1 and 2 cases (40%) at month 3. All PCO cases required Nd:YAG capsulotomy, performed at month 3 in 2 eyes (40%) and month 6 in 3 eyes (60%). No Nd:YAG-related complications were documented.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ENOVA GF3 single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL demonstrated a low 1-year incidence of PCO (3.3%) requiring Nd:YAG capsulotomy, which may be attributed to its hydrophobic acrylic material, sharp posterior optic edge, and stable in-the-bag positioning. These findings support the favorable posterior capsular performance and optical stability of the ENOVA GF3 IOL.

41410782,Preclinical evaluation of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]CHDI-009R for quantification of mutant huntingtin aggregates.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT) that subsequently leads to aggregation of the mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. Thus, lowering mHTT is a key therapeutic approach used by several candidate therapeutics currently under investigation. Visualization of the efficiency of these therapeutics through in vivo mHTT quantification rises in importance. For positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mHTT aggregates, it is critical to characterize the in vivo kinetic profile of newly identified mHTT binders to assess their translational application. Here, we report the evaluation of [<sup>11</sup>C]CHDI-009R, a PET imaging radioligand with higher affinity and selectivity for mHTT aggregates than previously reported radioligands, in the heterozygous zQ175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type littermates at 9 and 3 months of age. [<sup>11</sup>C]CHDI-009R displayed high stability in plasma and brain, which was reflected in brain kinetics as demonstrated by rapid uptake followed by relatively slow elimination. Kinetic modeling and volume of distribution V<sub>T (IDIF)</sub> indicated the radioligand's ability to quantify mHTT aggregation at 9 months of age with clear genotype differentiation (p < 0.0001). [<sup>11</sup>C]CHDI-009R showed an excellent test-retest reliability in 9-month-old mice (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.62-0.79). A phenotypic difference in mHTT aggregates was also observed in 3-month-old mice in several brain structures (p < 0.05) and was confirmed with [<sup>3</sup>H]CHDI-009R autoradiography. Overall, this study suggests [<sup>11</sup>C]CHDI-009R is a promising radioligand for the detection of cerebral mHTT aggregates in a mouse model of HD and supports its advance to clinical evaluation. KEY MESSAGES: [<sup>11</sup>C]CHDI-009R clearly differentiated between genotypes at low and high mHTT aggregate stages. [<sup>11</sup>C]CHDI-009R presented high reproducibility during test-retest imaging.

The cohort from center 1 was divided into training (n = 770) and validation (n = 330) sets, with center 2 as the test set (n = 252). The optimal cut-off for the MR triangular cord thickness (MR-TCT) was derived from the area under the ROC curve (AUC) calculated from all cases. Extrahepatic bile ducts visualization on 3D MRCP was validated against surgical findings. Image quality metrics were assessed for their diagnostic value on BA detection.<h4>Results</h4>One thousand three hundred fifty-two eligible cholestatic infants undergoing 3D MRCP (February 2012 to June 2023) were enrolled, including 363 BA and 989 non-BA. ROC analysis identified 3.75 mm as the optimal cut-off MR-TCT for BA diagnosis (AUC = 0.828). The combination of MR-TCT, 3D MRCP, and US yielded superior diagnostic performance, achieving AUCs of 0.967 in the training set, 0.958 in the validation set, and 0.972 in the test set (all p < 0.001). Image quality scores (p < 0.001), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (p < 0.001), contrast ratio (p = 0.012), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (p < 0.001) of 3D MRCP significantly differed between correct and incorrect diagnosis groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>3D MRCP is a valuable diagnostic adjunct tool in diagnosing BA, particularly when combined with MR-TCT and US. Optimizing 3D MRCP image quality enhances diagnostic accuracy.<h4>Critical relevance statement</h4>3D MRCP enhances BA diagnosis when combined with MR-TCT and US. Importantly, in cases with strong clinical suspicion but negative US findings, MRCP should be utilized as an adjunct diagnostic modality to reduce false-negative rates.<h4>Key points</h4>The diagnostic efficacy of 3D-MRCP in BA remains to be fully characterized. MR-TCT, 3D-MRCP, and US combined achieved optimal diagnostic accuracy for BA. For high-suspicion BA with negative US, adjunct 3D-MRCP reduces false-negative diagnoses.",Liu S; Zhang R; He Y; Liu Y; Wang R; Zhou Z; Ma H; He X; Yan S; Huang L; Jiang K; Liu H,"Department of Radiology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.",Insights into imaging,2025-12-17,10.1186/s13244-025-02165-5,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cholestasis; ultrasound; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Biliary Atresia
41406099,"Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Lassa fever vaccines: A living systematic review and landscape analysis of vaccine candidates.","<h4>Background</h4>Lassa fever (LF) is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness endemic in West Africa, representing significant public health challenges, particularly for pregnant persons and children who experience higher morbidity and mortality. Although several vaccine candidates are being developed, no LF vaccine has been licensed yet.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a living systematic review (LSR) of the literature to evaluate the safety, efficacy, effectiveness, and immunogenicity of LF vaccines. We performed biweekly searches in major biomedical databases, trial registries, preprint servers, and other sources. Eligible studies included preclinical studies, clinical trials, and observational studies published from January 2014 to April 2025. Reviewer pairs screened studies extracted data (REDCap), and assessed risk of bias independently. Data synthesis involved random-effects pairwise and proportion meta-analyses (R software), with GRADE assessment of evidence certainty. PROSPERO registries: (CRD42024514513; CRD42024516754).<h4>Results</h4>Searches retrieved 1423 records, including 51 studies, 2 clinical trials in adults involving 88 vaccinated persons, and 49 preclinical studies of 30 vaccine candidates. Trials evaluated Recombinant Measles-Vectored (MV-LASV) and Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-based (rVSVΔG-LASV-GPC) LF vaccine candidates. No published clinical trials were found to evaluate LF vaccines in special populations such as pregnant persons, infants, children, or adolescents. Although injection site reactogenicity was reported, no vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in study participants. Immunogenicity was robust in adults, with vaccines achieving around 95% seroconversion at 30 days. Preclinical data evaluated nine different platforms. Findings are disseminated via an interactive online dashboard (https://safeinpregnancy.org/living-systematic-review-lassa/).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Currently, two LF vaccine candidates that have advanced to clinical trials exhibit high immunogenicity, but the safety profile in healthy adults is still limited.
