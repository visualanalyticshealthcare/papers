41428899,Visualization of Experience Sampling Method Data in Mental Health: Qualitative Study of the Physicians' Perspective in Germany.,"<h4>Background</h4>Although the integration of self-monitored patient data into mental health care offers potential for advancing personalized approaches, its application in clinical practice remains largely underexplored. Capturing individuals' mental health outside the therapy room using experience sampling methodology (ESM) may bridge this gap by supporting shared decision-making and personalized interventions.<h4>Objective</h4>This qualitative study investigated the perspectives of German mental health professionals regarding prototypes of ESM data visualizations designed for integration into a digital mental health tool.<h4>Methods</h4>Semistructured interviews were conducted with clinicians on their perceptions of such visualizations in routine care.<h4>Results</h4>Using reflexive thematic analysis, 3 key findings emerged (1) ESM and ESM data visualizations were seen as valuable tools for enhancing patient motivation and engagement over the course of treatment; (2) simplicity and clarity of visual formats, particularly line graphs, were preferred for usability; and (3) practical concerns, such as workflow integration challenges centered on time constraints (psychotherapy session duration 50 min) and need for patient psychoeducation materials, influenced perceived utility. Challenges, including the risk of cognitive overload from dense data representations (eg, ESM mood-in-context visualizations), were raised.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings underline the importance of designing digital tools that align with clinical needs while addressing potential barriers to implementation by exploring the opportunities and challenges associated with ESM visualizations.",Schulte-Strathaus JCC; Ikegwuonu T; Schick A; Wolters MK; de Thurah L; Hajdúk M; Kurilla A; Myin-Germeys I; Kiekens G; Weermeijer JDM; Beames JR; Uyttebroek L; Bonnier R; Nagyova I; Breznoščáková D; Dančík D; Sotomayor Enriquez K; Barne I; Gugel J; Reininghaus U; Wensing M; Ullrich C,"Department of Public Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Central Institute of Mental Health, Heidelberg University, J5, Mannheim, 68159, Germany, 062117033734.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-12-22,10.2196/72893,13.8,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Qualitative Research; Data Visualization; Experience Sampling Method; Mhealth; Mobile Health; Personalized Care
41444288,One Health-related risk factors and seasonal variations in zoonotic bacteriological contamination of livestock water sources.,"Water contamination by pathogens threatens livestock health, productivity, and food security. The study aims to assess bacterial contamination in livestock water, seasonal variation, and identify key One Health risk factors. A laboratory-based cross-sectional study analyzed 420 water samples from randomly selected animal farms. Standard microbial culture techniques identify zoonotic pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Acinetobacter, and Escherichia coli (E. coli)). The analysis, which combined descriptive and multiple logistic regression with innovative visualizations, including a map of the South Gondar Zone, waffle plots, radial plots, and forest plots, was conducted using R version 4.5.1. This study employs a One Health framework to identify the primary factors driving zoonotic bacterial contamination in livestock feed and drinking water. Through descriptive analytics and multiple logistic regression, we identify three critical dimensions: seasonal variation (rainy season), animal species (ruminant, including goats and sheep, and poultry), and risk practices (wastewater discharge and shallow well use). Results reveal significantly higher contamination during rainy periods (e.g., Acinetobacter increased by 60% in livestock drinking water), while ownership of chickens (aOR = 2.52, *p* = 0.002), goats (aOR = 2.41, *p* = 0.001), and sheep (aOR = 1.72, *p* = 0.01) markedly elevated contamination odds. Wastewater discharge (aOR = 1.85, *p* = 0.03) and shallow well use (aOR = 1.45, *p* = 0.02) were significant anthropogenic risk factors. Visualization includes radial seasonal comparisons, diverging water-use bars, and sorted forest plots that highlight these synergies. This study highlights significant zoonotic bacteriological contamination in water used for livestock and feed production, with elevated levels during the rainy season. Key contributing factors include livestock type, wastewater discharge, shallow water sources, and seasonal variations. Adopting a One Health approach is crucial for mitigating contamination risks, focusing on enhanced water management, targeted interventions, and risk reduction strategies to protect both public and environmental health.",Yenew C; Temesgen A; Gebeyehu AA; Enawgaw AS; Yemata GA; Ejigu AG; Tsega TD; Yeshiwas AG; Anteneh RM; Yigzaw ZA; Yirdaw G; Tsega SS; Kebede AM; Mekonnen BA; Alemayehu MA; Mekonen H; Ahmed AF; Asmare ZA; Bayeh GM,"Department of Public Health, Debre Tabor University, Debre Tabor, Ethiopia. chalachewyenew50@gmail.com.",Scientific reports,2025-12-24,10.1038/s41598-025-28199-9,8.5,"visual analytics(kw); visualization(abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Seasonal variation; Ruminants; Logistic regression; Water contamination; risk factors; Visual Analytics; One Health; Zoonotic Pathogens
41427618,Development and Evaluation of a Multimodal Debriefing Dashboard for Virtual Reality Cardiac Arrest Simulation.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Wearable sensing technologies incorporated into virtual reality (VR) headsets can provide a number of unique, previously hidden insights into individual and team learning and performance in complex environments. However, the most impactful and efficient mechanisms for conveying multimodal data (e.g., gaze, mental workload, etc) allowing for unique insights are not well understood. This study used a human-centered design process to develop and evaluate a multimodal debriefing dashboard.<h4>Methods</h4>Twelve Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Instructors completed VR cardiac arrest simulations and participated in interviews and design thinking workshops to identify dashboard features, leading to high-fidelity mock-ups and an interactive prototype. A second group of 6 ACLS instructors then evaluated the prototype by providing mock feedback on simulation performance with and without the dashboard in a pre-post format, followed by surveys assessing usability, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, trust, and perceived accuracy.<h4>Results</h4>The final prototype dashboard features a video, a timeline of clinical actions, automatic error identification, mental workload, and visual attention data. It also generates closed-loop communication reports on a separate webpage. The evaluation study showed that participants provided performance analysis and feedback to students when using the dashboard, targeting specific (non)technical skills aligned with ACLS learning objectives. Participants rated the dashboard highly, with a System Usability Scale score of 88.9%, reflecting above-average usability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>An interactive multimodal debriefing dashboard prototype was developed using a user-design framework with prototyping and iterative feedback. Use of the dashboard resulted in improved evaluation and debriefing practices targeting learning outcomes, with participants rating the dashboard favorably. This dashboard has the potential to enhance simulation-based learning by offering near real-time analytics that promote a deeper understanding of individual and team technical and nontechnical skill acquisition and mastery.",Harmer B; Erickson J; Ross S; Bhatnagar D; Dowker S; Park H; Sample AP; Hartley S; Cooke J; Cole M; Popov V,"From the Department of Learning Health Sciences (B.H.), University of Michigan and Creighton University; University of Michigan (J.E., S.R., D.B., S.D., H.P., A.P.S., S.H., J.C., M.C., V.P.), Ann Arbor, MI.",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,2025-12-22,10.1097/sih.0000000000000901,8.4,"dashboard(kw,title,abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract)",Virtual reality; Cardiac arrest; Debriefing; Emergency Medicine; Human Factors; Eye Gaze; Cognitive Load; Closed-loop Communication; Healthcare Simulation; Multimodal Dashboard
41449765,Photoacoustic Microscopy for Multiscale Biological System Visualization and Clinical Translation.,"Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has emerged as a versatile modality in biomedical research, notable for its noninvasively, high spatial resolution, and superior optical contrast. Compared with pure optical imaging techniques, PAM leverages weakly scattered ultrasonic signals for image formation, thereby achieving high-resolution visualization of deep tissues. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements in PAM, encompassing technological innovations, organ-specific applications, and emerging pathways toward clinical translation. This discussion starts by exploring the fundamental physical principles of PAM and elaborates on the enhanced performance achieved through significant advancements in high-speed scanners, array transducers, artificial intelligence-enhanced algorithms, and molecular agents. Pioneering applications in single‑cell analysis, hepatic microcirculation characterization, renal clearance monitoring, tumor metastasis detection, and neuroscientific discovery are surveyed to demonstrate PAM's ability. Prospective clinical uses, including intraoperative guidance and point‑of‑care diagnostics, are considered alongside persistent limitations, notably limited penetration depth and multispectral imaging speed. Future advancements are expected to hinge on multimodal integration, deeper integration of artificial intelligence, and the development of standardized protocols to accelerate clinical implementation.

41428352,Scalable Big Data Platform With End-to-End Traceability for Health Data Monitoring in Older Adults: Development and Performance Evaluation.,"<h4>Background</h4>The increasing use of real-time health data from wearable devices and self-reported questionnaires offers significant opportunities for preventive care in aging populations. However, current health data platforms often lack built-in mechanisms for data and model traceability, version control, and coordinated management of heterogeneous data streams, which are essential for clinical accountability, regulatory compliance, and reproducibility. The absence of these features limits the reuse of health data and the reproducibility of analytical workflows across research and clinical environments.<h4>Objective</h4>This work presents DeltaTrace, a unified big data health platform designed with traceability as a key architectural feature. The platform integrates end-to-end tracking of data and model versions with real-time and batch processing capabilities. Built entirely on open source technologies, DeltaTrace combines components for data management, model management, orchestration, and visualization. The main objective is to demonstrate that embedding traceability within the architecture enables scalable, auditable, and version-controlled processing of health data, thereby facilitating reproducible analytics and long-term maintenance of health monitoring systems.<h4>Methods</h4>DeltaTrace adopts a medallion architecture implemented with Delta Lake to ensure atomic and version-controlled data transformations. Apache Spark is used for distributed computation, Apache Kafka for continuous data ingestion, and Apache Airflow for orchestration of batch and streaming workflows. MLflow manages the lifecycle and versioning of machine learning models, while Grafana provides visualization dashboards for real-time and aggregated data inspection. The platform is evaluated using continuous physiological signals from wearable devices and batch-ingested questionnaire data, combining synthetic and real data from the LifeSnaps dataset. Performance tests are conducted on central processing unit-only servers with 8-core and 24-core configurations to assess ingestion, aggregation, visualization, and anomaly detection latency.<h4>Results</h4>DeltaTrace supports continuous processing for approximately 1500 users with end-to-end delays below 10 minutes. Ingestion and visualization tasks operate between mean 4.9 (SD 0.12) and 7.5 (SD 0.28) minutes, while aggregation and anomaly detection required less than mean 5.6 (SD 0.04) and 10.5 (SD 1.70) minutes, respectively. Increasing from 8 to 24 cores improved ingestion and cleaning latency by up to 25% and anomaly detection performance by up to 50%. The system maintains consistent performance across different data types, processing modes, and loads.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DeltaTrace provides a scalable and modular architecture that incorporates traceability as a core component together with functions for model management, orchestration, and visualization. The platform enables complete version control across data and models and maintains performance under limited hardware conditions. These characteristics support reproducible and auditable health data processing and make DeltaTrace suitable for continuous monitoring and preventive health care in aging populations.",Cejudo A; Tellechea Y; Calvo A; Almeida A; Martín C; Beristain A,"Vicomtech Foundation, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Mikeletegi 57, Donostia-San Sebastián, Basque Country, 20009, Spain, 34 943 309 230.",JMIR medical informatics,2025-12-22,10.2196/81701,7.3,"visualization(abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Early Detection; Older Adults; data management; Telemonitoring; Wearable; Big Data
41424186,Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging With Indocyanine Green for Intraoperative Nerve Root Visualization in Spinal Surgery: From Preclinical Studies to a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Study DesignPilot randomized controlled trial.ObjectivesIatrogenic nerve injury is a major complication in endoscopic spinal surgery, potentially causing serious neurological deficits. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) has shown promise for intraoperative nerve root identification. This study assessed the feasibility, optimal dosing, safety, and mechanism of ICG fluorescence for nerve root visualization, transitioning from preclinical to clinical phases.MethodsIn the preclinical phase, 36 rabbits were assigned to ICG dose groups (1.4, 2.8, or 5.5 mg/kg, corresponding to 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg in humans) and observation times (3, 6, 12, or 24 hours). Fluorescence signals in lumbar nerve roots were quantified by signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Histological analyses explored ICG retention mechanisms. In the clinical phase, 40 patients undergoing unilateral biportal endoscopic surgery for lumbar disc herniation were randomized into different ICG dose groups (0, 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg), administered 1.5 hours preoperatively. Intraoperative fluorescence parameters, nerve root identification time, and perioperative outcomes (VAS and ODI scores) were assessed.ResultsIn preclinical studies, the 2.8 and 5.5 mg/kg groups showed peak SBR and MFI at 3 hours post-injection. Histology revealed ICG accumulation in nerve root microvascular regions. In the clinical study, the 2 mg/kg group had the highest SBR and MFI, reducing nerve root identification time without significant adverse events.ConclusionICG fluorescence imaging is a feasible and safe technique for intraoperative nerve root visualization, with ICG accumulation attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention effect.",Huang H; Chen Z; Wu S; Wang L; Zhu X; Xiao L; Deng Z; Wei R; Gu M; Cai L; Lei J; Xie Y,"Department of Spine Surgery and Musculoskeletal Tumor, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.",Global spine journal,2025-12-22,10.1177/21925682251407941,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Endoscopy; Indocyanine green; Spinal nerve roots; Disc Herniation; Near-infrared Fluorescence Imaging
41436907,Improving Community-Based Care for Adolescents with ADHD: a Randomized Controlled Trial of Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Fidelity Supports.,"Cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBTs) for adolescents with ADHD demonstrate promise of long-term effects on outcome. However, their implementation in routine care community clinics faces barriers that impact quantity, efficiency, and quality of delivery, as well as client outcomes. This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of an AI-assisted service delivery model on therapist implementation of Supporting Teens' Autonomy Daily (STAND), a CBT blended with Motivational Interviewing (MI) for adolescents with ADHD. Adolescents with ADHD (N = 51), who were clients at three community mental health agencies, received treatment from 23 therapists. There was randomization of adolescents and therapists to AI-assisted or standard implementation supports. In addition to standard supports (i.e., training, standard facilitation resources, technical assistance, case supervision), AI-assisted support package included digitized facilitation resources housed in a clinical dashboard (Care4), feedback on content fidelity, and AI-generated feedback on MI implementation quality. The AI-assisted group was associated with more efficient treatment delivery and lower number of appointments attended by the adolescent. There was also a significant decrement in MI quality over time in the AI-assisted group compared to the standard support group. Feedback in focus groups indicated that therapists perceived a task-oriented mindset to be associated with receipt of the AI-assisted support package, leading therapists to prioritize efficiency over relational aspects of therapy. Following the results of this trial, a future, larger RCT should examine the impact of the AI-assisted implementation model on mental health outcomes and cost savings to organizations, third party payers, and clients.

40639971,Visualization of Nerve Pathology and Correlation with Clinical Severity in Bell Palsy Using 3D Double-Echo Steady-State with Water Excitation Sequence.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Bell palsy (BP) is the most common cause of facial nerve (FN) palsy. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic ability of the 3D double-echo steady-state with water excitation (3D-DESS-WE) sequence to visualize pathologic changes in the FN of patients with BP.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with BP who underwent 3T MRI including 3D-DESS-WE within 30 days of onset and 60 sex- and age (SD, 2) matched controls. Qualitative evaluation of FN signal intensity (SI<sub>FN</sub>) and thickness (TH<sub>FN</sub>) was performed using a 3-point scale. Quantitative metrics included SI<sub>FN</sub> and TH<sub>FN</sub> measurements and affected-to-unaffected signal intensity and thickness ratios (SR<sub>A/U</sub> and TR<sub>A/U</sub>) in the BP group, and right-to-left ratios in controls. Interobserver agreement, group comparisons, correlations with clinical severity (Yanagihara score), and diagnostic performance were assessed. In a subset of 17 matched pairs, the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced (CE) T1WI was assessed, and its agreement with 3D-DESS-WE-based qualitative assessment was evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Qualitative scores for SI<sub>FN</sub> and TH<sub>FN</sub> were significantly higher in the BP group than in controls (<i>P</i> < .001), with high interobserver agreement (κ = 0.810, 0.788, respectively). When dichotomized (score 0 versus 1-2), qualitative assessments showed good diagnostic performance with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.82 for SI<sub>FN</sub>, and 0.90 and 0.80 for TH<sub>FN,</sub> respectively. Neither qualitative score correlated significantly with clinical severity. Agreement between 3D-DESS-WE-based and CE T1WI-based qualitative assessments was substantial to almost perfect (κ = 0.766-0.882). In quantitative analysis, both SI<sub>FN</sub> and TH<sub>FN</sub> were significantly higher on the affected side in the BP group (<i>P</i> < .001), whereas no significant lateral differences were observed in controls. Although SI<sub>FN</sub>, TH<sub>FN</sub>, and SR<sub>A/U</sub> did not correlate significantly with clinical severity, TR<sub>A/U</sub> was significantly inversely correlated with the Yanagihara score (<i>r</i> = -0.413, <i>P</i> = .02), which corresponds to a positive correlation with clinical severity. The Yanagihara score was the only independent predictor of TR<sub>A/U</sub> in multiple regression analysis (β = -0.425, <i>P</i> = .04). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed high diagnostic performance: area under the curve = 0.908 for SR<sub>A/U</sub> and 0.927 for TR<sub>A/U</sub>.<h4>Conclusions</h4>3D-DESS-WE may be a valuable tool for the routine clinical assessment of BP.",Fujii H; Kikuchi T; Fujii N; Chiba E; Masuoka S; Nakamata A; Hamamoto K; Matsuki M; Mori H,"From the Department of Radiology, Jichi Medical University, School of Medicine, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, Japan hiroyuki.fujii@jichi.ac.jp.",AJNR.

41430237,CD155 reprograms glycolysis via the YAP/TEAD1-GLUT1 axis to promote lung adenocarcinoma progression and M2 macrophage polarization: a metabolic-immune target visualized by &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET/CT.,"<h4>Background</h4>CD155, an emerging immune checkpoint, contributes to tumor immune evasion and progression, but its roles in metabolic reprogramming and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remain uncharacterized. This study combines molecular biology, metabolic imaging, and clinical data to elucidate CD155's dual role in driving LUAD progression through glycolytic rewiring and immunosuppressive TAMs polarization.<h4>Methods</h4>Through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT imaging, we analyzed CD155 expression and its association with glycolysis in 80 LUAD patients. Functional assays and molecular studies revealed CD155-mediated regulation of tumor glycolysis and macrophage polarization via YAP/TEAD1-GLUT1 signaling. Xenograft models validated the in vivo findings, with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG micro-PET imaging performing noninvasive metabolic profiling.<h4>Results</h4>CD155 was significantly overexpressed in LUAD tissues and positively correlated with advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and elevated <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake. Mechanistically, CD155 interacts with YAP, reducing YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 to promote its nuclear translocation and TEAD1 activation, thereby upregulating GLUT1 transcription. This signaling axis enhanced glycolysis, thereby fueling LUAD proliferation and migration. Notably, CD155-induced lactate production and extracellular acidification drove macrophage polarization toward the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. In vivo, CD155 silencing suppressed tumor glucose metabolism and growth, whereas overexpression accelerated tumor progression, both dynamically monitored through <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET visualization.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We identify a novel CD155/YAP/TEAD1/GLUT1 axis that reprograms LUAD metabolism and facilitates immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment formation. CD155 functions as a metabolic-immune hub in LUAD, and its targeting could simultaneously suppress tumor growth and restore antitumor immunity, offering dual therapeutic advantages.

41432373,Predictive modeling of hematoma expansion from non-contrast computed tomography in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients.,"Hematoma expansion is a consistent predictor of poor neurological outcome and mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An incomplete understanding of its biophysiology has limited early preventative intervention. Transport-based morphometry (TBM) is a mathematical modeling technique that uses a physically meaningful metric to quantify and visualize discriminating image features that are not readily perceptible to the human eye. We hypothesized that TBM could discover relationships between hematoma morphology on initial Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and hematoma expansion. 170 spontaneous ICH patients enrolled in the multi-center international Virtual International Trials of Stroke Archive (VISTA-ICH) with time-series NCCT data were used for model derivation. Its performance was assessed on a test dataset of 170 patients from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study. A unique transport-based representation was produced from each presentation NCCT hematoma image to identify morphological features of expansion. The principal hematoma features identified by TBM were larger size, density heterogeneity, shape irregularity, and peripheral density distribution. These were consistent with clinician-identified features of hematoma expansion, corroborating the hypothesis that morphological characteristics of the hematoma promote future growth. Incorporating these traits into a multivariable model comprising morphological, spatial, and clinical information achieved an AUROC of 0.71 for quantifying 24 hr hematoma expansion risk in the test dataset. This outperformed existing clinician protocols and alternate machine learning methods, suggesting that TBM detected features with improved precision than by visual inspection alone. This pre-clinical study presents a quantitative and interpretable method for discovery and visualization of NCCT biomarkers of hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Because TBM has a direct physical meaning, its modeling of NCCT hematoma features can inform hypotheses for hematoma expansion mechanisms. It has potential future application as a clinical risk stratification tool.",Ironside N; El Naamani K; Rizvi T; El-Rabbi MS; Kundu S; Becceril-Gaitan A; Pas K; Snyder MH; Chen CJ; Langefeld C; Woo D; Mayer SA; Connolly ES; Rohde GK; ; ,"Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, United States.",eLife,2025-12-23,10.7554/elife.105782,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(abstract),Human; Predictive modeling; Neuroscience; Stroke; Intracerebral hemorrhage; systems biology; computational biology; Hematoma Expansion
41449289,SkinAttn-Net: a multi-level attention-based network for skin lesion segmentation.,"Accurate segmentation of skin lesions is essential for automated melanoma detection and dermoscopic image analysis. Traditional convolutional networks often fail to capture both fine-grained lesion boundaries and global contextual information. We porpose SkinAttn-Net, a stage-aware segmentation framework that integrates complementary attention mechanisms according to the functional role of each network component. A vision transformer module is employed at the encoder bottleneck to model long-range dependencies and global context, Convolutional Block Attention Modules to refine intermediate encoder-decoder feature interactions, and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to recalibrate skip connections and preserve high-resolution lesion characteristics. The model was extensively evaluated on three widely used dermoscopic datasets, including intra- and cross-dataset experiments, ablation analyses, module-wise dropout sensitivity assessments, and qualitative visualization studies. Quantitative results show Dice scores of 0.926, 0.910, and 0.951 on ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and HAM10000, respectively, with consistently high precision, recall, and specificity. Cross-dataset evaluation demonstrates robust generalization across imaging conditions and lesion types. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of different modules, while dropout analyses reveal the effectiveness of moderate regularization in enhancing stability and generalization. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods highlight superior segmentation performance. Grad-CAM visualizations indicate progressive refinement of lesion boundaries across decoder layers. SkinAttn-Net effectively combines hierarchical attention mechanisms to balance local detail preservation with global contextual modeling, offering a robust, generalizable solution for dermoscopic image analysis and clinical decision support in dermatology.",Söylemez ÖF,"Faculty of Engineering, Department of Computer Engineering, Dicle University, Diyarbakir, 21200, Turkey. osoylemez@dicle.edu.tr.",Scientific reports,2025-12-25,10.1038/s41598-025-33767-0,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); clinical decision support(abstract); data(abstract),Attention; Segmentation; Medical Image Analysis; Dermoscopy; Deep Learning
41444533,Identification of potential characteristic genes in sepsis utilizing RNA sequencing and gene silence.,"<h4>Background</h4>Sepsis represents a serious condition involving organ dysfunction that can be life-threatening, posing a significant threat to human health. The mortality rate associated with sepsis ranges from 10% to 40%, with severe cases or those involving septic shock exhibiting mortality rates exceeding 50%.<h4>Objective</h4>Gene sequencing took place on the blood samples that were collected both healthy volunteers and septic patients in this study. Advanced methodologies, including bioinformatics analysis, quantitative PCR (qPCR), meta-analysis, and single-cell localization analysis, were employed to identify potential biomarkers associated with the immunomodulation of sepsis. The identified molecular markers were further validated through the establishment of a sepsis cell model, gene silence techniques, and an ELISA test experiments to assess inflammatory factors.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, 23 individuals with sepsis and 10 healthy volunteers as controls, and peripheral blood samples were collected. The blood specimens were processed with the assistance of BGI for comprehensive gene sequencing. Post-sequencing, the data underwent quality control measures and were subsequently analyzed using the online platform iDEP 2.01 ( http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep/ ) to identify differentially expressed genes. Conduct Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analyses on the identified differentially expressed genes.To elucidate core genes from multiple perspectives, a PPI network was created with the help of the STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org/),facilitatin g the examination of gene interactions in terms of protein. Following the recognition of core genes, sepsis-associated data sets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public database. Specifically, the transcriptional expression of the gene S100A11 was analyzed using meta-analysis techniques, and its survival curve was subsequently evaluated.The S100A11 gene, identified through screening, was analyzed using an online visualization system to determine its single-cell localization. Initial findings indicated that the gene is predominantly expressed in macrophages. (THP-1 cells) are known as a human monocytic cell line utilized in studies.We cultured THP-1 cells and differentiated into macrophages, followed by stimulation and transfection with the S100A11 gene. The interference effect of S100A11 was assessed using quantitative fluorescence PCR (qPCR). Subsequently, THP-1 cells were cultured to establish a septic cell model, and S100A11 gene silence experiments were conducted, categorizing the samples into control, sepsis, and gene silence sepsis groups. ELISA was employed to assess the concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6.<h4>Results</h4>Results demonstrated that S100A11 is highly expressed in sepsis and is primarily localized in macrophages. The enrichment in signaling pathways, including Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, was uncovered by differential gene expression analysis.S100A11 serves as a critical regulatory node for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Notably, S100A11 was found to be highly expressed in patients with sepsis. This gene plays a crucial role in promoting inflammation during the septic inflammatory response and may be involved in macrophage differentiation, immunomodulation, and the inflammatory processes associated with sepsis.",Cao H; Qin N; Zhai Y; Dong C; Huang Z; Huang D; Li J; Yang J; Wang F; Wei W; Wang W,"Department of Emergency, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.",BMC immunology,2025-12-24,10.1186/s12865-025-00778-5,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract); informatics(abstract),Sepsis; Inflammatory Response; Rna Sequencing; S100a11; Gene Silence Sepsis Groups Techniques
41444844,Data-driven identification and semi-automated quantification of molecular targets for tumour-imaging of colorectal liver metastases and primary colorectal tumours.,"<h4>Background</h4>Accurate pre- and intraoperative assessment of disease extent is crucial for curative treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and primary colorectal cancer (pCRC). Tumour-targeted nuclear imaging can enhance pre- and postoperative tumour staging, while tumour-specific fluorescence-guided surgery can improve intraoperative visualization. However, validated targets remain limited, particularly for CRLM. This study aimed to identify and validate novel molecular targets for CRLM using a data-driven approach. Additional objectives included pCRC target expression and evaluating target expression in neoadjuvant-treated patients.<h4>Results</h4>Using a data-driven RNA-based discovery approach (Euretos), candidate targets for colorectal liver metastases were identified. Of these, the six highest-ranking targets-CEACAM5, EPCAM, CEACAM6, MUC13, FXYD3, and CDH17-were selected for validation through immunohistochemistry (IHC). Semi-automated image analysis quantified IHC staining intensity (0-100) for tumour epithelium and background on a per-pixel basis. A patient's staining pattern was regarded as positive if mean tumour epithelium scored positive (>25), background negative (<25) and tumour epithelium >25 points higher than background, referred to as relative positive expression. The proportion of CRLM samples showing relative positive expression was 79% for CEACAM5, 45% for EPCAM, 80% for CEACAM6, 24% for MUC13, 58% for FXYD3, and 22% for CDH17. CEACAM5/CEACAM6 combined positivity reached 90% (either one positive), showing that targeting both markers enables molecular imaging in nearly the entire population. Staining intensities were similar in pCRC epithelium (P >0.05). Neoadjuvant-treated CRLM exhibited higher expression for all targets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using a novel data-driven approach, six potential imaging targets were successfully identified and validated. CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 emerged as strong targets that, regardless of neoadjuvant therapy, covered nearly the entire CRLM population-supporting their further probe development and clinical translation.",Warmerdam MI; Amenchar N; Hutten F; Crobach ASLP; Bijlstra OD; Badr N; Mieog JSD; van Vlierberghe R; Vahrmeijer AL; Kuppen PJK,"Department of Surgery, Leiden University Medical Center, Albinusdreef 2, Leiden, 2333 ZA, The Netherlands. m.i.warmerdam@lumc.nl.",EJNMMI research,2025-12-25,10.1186/s13550-025-01354-z,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",Colorectal Cancer; Molecular Imaging; Nuclear Imaging; Colorectal Liver Metastases; Fluorescence-guided Surgery; Neoadjuvant Treatment
41443887,Recent Advances in Musculoskeletal Radiology: Bridging Innovation and Clinical Application.,"Recent advances in musculoskeletal (MSK) radiology have markedly improved diagnostic accuracy through innovations in MRI, CT, and artificial intelligence (AI). This review summarizes 7 key domains shaping current MSK imaging: (1) CT-like contrast MRI techniques for bone visualization, (2) quantitative MRI approaches, (3) AI applications in image reconstruction and diagnostic support, (4) MR spectroscopy (MRS) for metabolic assessment, (5) whole-body MRI for systemic disease evaluation, (6) positron emission tomography (PET) for metabolic and inflammatory imaging, and (7) advanced CT techniques such as weight-bearing CT. Zero echo time and ultrashort echo time MRI sequences enable the visualization and quantitative assessment of short-T2 tissues such as cortical bone, tendons, and fibrocartilage. Deep learning-based image reconstruction improves SNR and shortens scan time, enhancing image quality and diagnostic confidence. In parallel, AI-driven diagnostic support systems, including convolutional neural networks for lesion detection and natural language processing for report generation, are transforming workflow efficiency and consistency. MRS offers metabolic insights into muscle disorders such as sarcopenia, and whole-body-MRI provides comprehensive, radiation-free evaluation of tumor burden and inflammatory joint or enthesis involvement, making it valuable in oncology and rheumatic diseases. PET complements MRI by identifying metabolically active or inflammatory lesions. CT-based innovations further contribute to evaluating joint biomechanics with high spatial resolution. Together, these technological developments are enabling earlier disease detection, more precise diagnosis, and improved treatment monitoring, representing a paradigm shift in MSK imaging and clinical practice.",Ide S; Aoki T; Kurokawa R; Yanagawa M; Saida T; Sugawara S; Nishioka K; Oda S; Watabe T; Hirata K; Ito R; Ueda D; Takumi K; Honda M; Sakata A; Kawamura M; Sofue K; Iima M; Naganawa S,"Department of Radiology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan.",Magnetic resonance in medical sciences : MRMS : an official journal of Japan Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,2025-12-25,10.2463/mrms.rev.2025-0150,3.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract),Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Musculoskeletal Imaging; Whole-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Deep Learning Reconstruction; Computed Tomography–like Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging
41436817,Blockchain and digital twin integration for predictive and secure pandemic alerting.,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a necessity to implement the latest technologies that will help provide safe, real-time, and predictive medical services. The current pandemic alert apps, including BlueDot, Aarogya Setu, and the JHU Dashboard, are based on centralized reporting and manual updates, which reduce their scalability, security, and predictions. In an effort to address these gaps, this paper proposes a novel concept that integrates blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital twins to decentralize pandemic alerting and monitoring. Within the proposed COVID-DT model, blockchain enables the tamper-free, decentralized sharing of data across healthcare stakeholders. BiLSTM networks improve predictive accuracy over time, and DTs generate dynamic digital imprints for use in ongoing monitoring and simulation of outbreaks. An implementation was designed based on Raspberry Pi edge devices, IoT sensors, and Hyperledger Fabric, and simulated in MATLAB. Findings show predictive accuracy of 97.7, lower latency time of 4.3 min using 12 worker nodes, consistent message delivery (approximately 80%), and a cost of communication of less than 700 bytes with an error of 10 percent. These results demonstrate the scalability, low power, and cybersecurity of this model. The COVID-DT framework provides a safe, efficient, and interoperable backbone for the management of future pandemics, surpassing current centralized systems.",V P; R K,"Department of Information Technology, A.

41443197,GA4GH phenopacket-driven characterization of genotype-phenotype correlations in Mendelian disorders.,"Comprehensively characterizing genotype-phenotype correlations (GPCs) in Mendelian disease would create new opportunities for improving clinical management and understanding disease biology. However, heterogeneous approaches to data sharing, reuse, and analysis have hindered progress in the field. We developed Genotype-Phenotype Statistical Evaluation of Associations (GPSEA), a software package that leverages the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Phenopacket Schema to represent case-level clinical and genetic data about individuals. GPSEA applies an independent filtering strategy to boost statistical power to detect categorical GPCs represented by Human Phenotype Ontology terms. GPSEA additionally enables visualization and analysis of continuous phenotypes, clinical severity scores, and survival data such as age of onset of disease or clinical manifestations. We applied GPSEA to 85 cohorts with 6,179 previously published individuals with variants in one of 81 genes associated with 122 Mendelian diseases and identified 253 significant GPCs, with 48 cohorts having at least one statistically significant GPC. These results highlight the power of standardized representations of clinical data for scalable discovery of GPCs in Mendelian disease.",Rekerle L; Danis D; Rehburg F; Graefe ASL; Bily V; Caballero-Oteyza A; Cacheiro P; Chimirri L; Chong JX; Connelly E; de Vries BBA; Dingemans AJM; Duyzend MH; Freiberger T; Gehle P; Groza T; Hansen P; Jacobsen JOB; Klocperk A; Ladewig MS; Love MI; Marcello AJ; Mordhorst A; Munoz-Torres MC; Reese J; Schuetz C; Smedley D; Strauss T; Vladyka O; Zocche D; Thun S; Mungall CJ; Haendel MA; Robinson PN,"The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, 10 Discovery Drive, Farmington CT 06032, USA.",American journal of human genetics,2025-12-23,10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.12.001,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Genotype-phenotype Correlation; Human Phenotype Ontology; Mendelian Disease; Global Alliance For Genomics And Health
41432534,Application of 3D printing in the evaluation of a clinically significant congenital uterine anomaly.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Congenital uterine anomalies are the result of abnormal development of the Müllerian ducts and occur in approximately 5% of the general female population. These malformations often remain asymptomatic and undiagnosed until complications arise, especially during reproductive years. Accurate diagnosis and classification are crucial for counseling, reproductive planning, and appropriate surgical management. Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) imaging and printing technology have enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in complex gynecologic cases. This report aims to present a rare postpartum complication associated with a congenital uterine anomaly, characterize the histopathological and radiological features of the case, and assess the role of printed three-dimensional (3D) anatomical modeling in supporting accurate post hoc classification and surgical decision-making.<h4>Material and methods</h4>A 25-year-old primiparous woman with a congenital uterine malformation underwent cesarean section at 28 weeks of gestation due to premature rupture of membranes and regular uterine contractions. One month postpartum, the patient presented with vaginal discharge and reported a palpable resistance in the vagina. Pelvic examination revealed a lobulated, dark pink, nonbleeding, firm mass measuring approximately 15 × 10 cm protruding into the vagina, along with an intact vaginal septum located 2-3 cm from the introitus. Ultrasound demonstrated an irregular mass in the right uterine cavity with indistinct margins suggestive of a necrotic fibroid. The patient underwent surgery involving removal of the vaginal mass and resection of the vaginal septum. Histopathological examination revealed fascicularly arranged, shadowed spindle cells consistent with necrotic smooth muscle tissue of myometrial origin, indicative of degenerative tissue of the uterine septum. Subsequently, a patient-specific 3D printed uterine model was generated using imaging and surgical data to facilitate detailed postoperative anatomical assessment.<h4>Results</h4>Postoperative assessment using the 3Dprinted model enabled a precise classification of the malformation as a ""double septate uterus with cervix and septate vagina"" (ESHRE/ESGE classification U2bC2V1) with an intracavitary FIGO type 2 submucosal leiomyoma. The 3D model provided a tangible visualization of the uterine architecture, improving anatomical understanding, facilitating retrospective diagnosis, and supporting interdisciplinary evaluation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This case demonstrates the diagnostic and educational utility of 3D printing in the management of rare Müllerian anomalies. Integration of patient-specific 3D models into clinical practice may improve diagnostic precision and surgical planning, particularly in complex gynecological malformations.",Vargova M; Kosibova Z; Janac P; Kristufkova A; Korbel M; Tvrdon T; Vitovic P; Niznanska Z,"1st Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University Bratislava, Slovakia, Slovakia.",Ginekologia polska,2025-12-23,10.5603/gpl.107796,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),3D Printing; Müllerian Anomaly; Anatomical Modeling; Congenital Uterine Malformation; Uterus Septus
41428415,Feasibility and efficacy of mobile three-dimensional c-arm systems for single-stage localization and resection of small pulmonary nodules: a pilot clinical trial.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Hybrid operating rooms (HORs) incorporating robotic C-arm systems facilitate concurrent localization and resection of small pulmonary nodules, albeit with significant cost barriers. Contemporary mobile 3 D C-arm systems may provide superior soft tissue visualization with enhanced economic viability and accessibility. This prospective single-arm clinical pilot trial was designed to assess the technical feasibility, clinical efficacy, and procedural safety of employing mobile 3 D C-arm technology for single-stage localization and excision of small pulmonary nodules.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients presenting with small and/or deep-seated lung tumors necessitating preoperative localization were eligible for inclusion. Two distinct mobile 3 D C-arm systems (Cios Spin and Ziehm Vision RFD 3 D) were employed. The primary end-points included the rate of successful tumour localization and the time required to complete the localization procedure. Secondary end-points encompassed perioperative complications and radiation exposure.<h4>Results</h4>The study cohort included 41 patients with lung tumors measuring a median diameter of 7.30 mm (interquartile range [IQR]: 5.00-9.20 mm) and a median depth of 10.00 mm (IQR: 2.00-18.00 mm). Successful localization was achieved in 40 patients, yielding a success rate of 97.6%. In one case, inadequate lesion visualization using the mobile 3 D C-arm necessitated localization in a hybrid operating room. The mean localization time was 27.17 ± 10.38 min, and the median radiation exposure was 531.04 μGy·m2 (IQR: (297.12-870.98) μGy·m2). All patients were successfully discharged, with a median postoperative hospital stay of 3 days (IQR: 3-3 days).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results support the technical feasibility, clinical efficacy, and procedural safety of mobile 3 D C-arm systems for single-stage localization and resection of small pulmonary nodules.",Fang HY; Cheng C; Chou PL; Chao YK,"Division of Thoracic Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",Interdisciplinary cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,2025-12-22,10.1093/icvts/ivaf313,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Resection; localization; Small Pulmonary Nodules; 3D C-arm Systems
41447821,Nanoplatform-Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Advances and Future Directions.,"<h4>Introduction and aims</h4>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma over the past 25 years, with nanotechnology accelerating its development. This study aimed to systematically map research trends, thematic evolutions, and technological advances in nano-enhanced PDT for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.<h4>Methods</h4>A bibliometric and trend analysis was performed on 736 English-language publications from January 2000 to June 2025, sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace/VOSviewer, BICOMB, gCLUTO, and related visualization tools were applied to analyse global research contributions, collaboration networks, keyword clusters, and technological breakthroughs.<h4>Results</h4>Annual publications increased from fewer than 30 (2000-2011) to over 50 (2022-2025), with China, the United States, and the United Kingdom as leading contributors. International collaborations have become more multipolar over time. Three major thematic clusters emerged: (1) fundamental PDT mechanisms, (2) nano-enhanced delivery systems and modulation of the tumour microenvironment, and (3) multimodal combination therapies. Recent growth in publications has been driven by nanoplatforms employing passive and active tumour targeting, along with oxygen-generating strategies.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although nano-enhanced PDT has achieved substantial preclinical progress, its clinical translation remains limited by manufacturing variability, regulatory uncertainty, and cost-effectiveness concerns. Progress will require well-designed multicentre trials, standardized nanomaterial characterization, and early incorporation of health-economic evaluation. By charting the integration of nanotechnology into PDT and identifying opportunities for synergistic and theranostic approaches, this research provides a structured reference to support future clinical translation.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Nano-enhanced PDT holds strong potential to improve treatment precision, reduce side effects, and address resistance in HNSCC, offering new strategies for both early-stage lesions and advanced tumours. By clarifying global research patterns and identifying key innovation areas, this study supports more effective clinical translation and evidence-based adoption of nano-enhanced PDT into head and neck cancer care pathways.",Zhang W; Gan M; He Y; Ma W; Liu S; Liu D,"Department of Emergency and Oral Medicine, School and Hospital of Stomatology, China Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.",International dental journal,2025-12-24,10.1016/j.identj.2025.109348,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cancer therapy; Photodynamic therapy; Nanotechnology; Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma; Tumour Microenvironment
41448444,Cross-modal image generation with uncertainty quantification from echo cardiogram to MRI.,"Medical imaging is fundamental to cardiovascular diagnostics, with modalities such as Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) offering complementary strengths. TTE provides real-time, non-invasive visualization of cardiac function but is often limited by operator dependency and incomplete views. In contrast, CMR delivers comprehensive, high-resolution structural assessments, although it comes with greater time and cost burdens. To address these limitations, this study explores cross-modal generative modeling techniques for synthesizing CMR-like images directly from TTE. We propose a novel architecture that combines a UNet backbone with a vision transformer, utilizing UNet for feature extraction and the transformer for global attention to improve image synthesis quality. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the model's ability to produce realistic and anatomically consistent CMR images, with strong potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making with multiple image modalities.",Choudhury ZZ; Dey S; Wang H; Coffey S; Chakraborti T; McCane B,"School of Computing, University of Otago, New Zealand.","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2025-12-23,10.1016/j.ymeth.2025.12.012,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),MRI; Echocardiography; Generative Ai
41444686,The eye-mind connection: a systematic review of retinal biomarkers and ocular signatures in major psychiatric disorders.,"<h4>Background</h4>Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and dementia are increasingly associated with specific ocular and retinal abnormalities. These associations may reflect shared neurovascular, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative mechanisms, yet findings remain scattered and understudied. This systematic review synthesizes existing evidence on ocular and retinal pathologies across major psychiatric conditions, highlighting common retinal biomarkers that may inform future screening strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase was conducted. Meta-analysis was initially planned but deemed infeasible due to significant methodological and reporting heterogeneity among eligible studies. Therefore, a structured qualitative synthesis was performed, supported by visual mapping of cross-disorder associations.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria, covering major psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and dementia. Across these disorders, approximately three-quarters of schizophrenia studies (≈75%) reported retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, and two-thirds of dementia studies (≈67%) showed retinal vascular abnormalities or RNFL loss. Glaucoma and dry eye syndrome were the most frequently observed in mood disorders, whereas microvascular dropout was reported in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) analyses of depression and bipolar disorder. The heatmap visualization highlighted overlapping neuro-ophthalmic signatures, and retinal biomarker analysis identified RNFL thinning and microvascular dropout as potential shared indicators of disease burden.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This review emphasizes the emerging evidence for retinal biomarkers as accessible correlates of neuropsychiatric pathology. Although quantitative synthesis was not feasible, the qualitative patterns highlight the need for large-scale, prospective, and biomarker-validation studies integrating ophthalmology and psychiatry. These findings underscore the clinical potential of the brain-retina axis in mental health diagnostics.",Motamedi R; Hayeri Mehrizi F; Zeinali Ali Abadi M; Mohagheghi M; Nourollahi Fomeshi F; Mousavikhah SE; Ghaffarzadeh A; Yaghmayee S; Arab Bafrani M; Sadat Rafiei SK; Shafiei D; Asadi Anar M; Khosravi F; Faizabadi S; Bozorgi M; Saien S,"Faculty of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.",European journal of medical research,2025-12-24,10.1186/s40001-025-03664-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Schizophrenia; glaucoma; Dementia; Systematic review; Bipolar disorder; Psychiatric Disorder; retinal nerve fiber layer; Ocular Pathology
41424166,Ultrasound Guidance to Augment Needle Electromyography Precision in the Complex Nerve Injury Setting.,"The rise in popularity of nerve transfer surgery in individuals with peripheral nerve and spinal cord injuries has elevated the importance of the preoperative electrodiagnostic examination. Needle electromyography (EMG) provides peripheral nerve surgeons with precise information about donor and recipient muscle health, aiding in decisions regarding surgical options, donor muscle viability, and timing of intervention. However, traditional anatomical landmarks for typical donor and recipient nerve-muscle combinations in nerve transfer surgery are either not well described in the literature or become less dependable in the presence of contracture, spasticity, or muscle atrophy and fibrosis. Ultrasound (US) can be a valuable tool to augment the needle EMG examination. Herein, we describe US approaches to improve the precision of the needle EMG examination for 10 muscles in the upper extremity and two muscles in the lower extremity that are routinely involved as either donors or recipients in nerve transfer surgery. The purpose is to provide a reference guide for the electrodiagnostic medicine specialist in the complex nerve injury setting. This includes information on surrounding anatomical structures for localization and those that should be avoided. Relevant US principles for EMG are discussed including: (1) the advantages and disadvantages of short-axis and long-axis views of the target muscle, emphasizing the predominant use of short-axis for adequate visualization of all surrounding structures and enhancing patient safety, (2) in-plane versus out-of-plane approaches, and (3) enhancing confidence in the precision of the needle EMG via the dynamic capability of US.",Saddler N; Ro H; Bristol S; Khayambashi S; Berger MJ,"Division of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",Muscle & nerve,2025-12-22,10.1002/mus.70100,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Spinal cord injury; Peripheral nerve injury; ultrasound; Needle Electromyography; Nerve Transfer Surgery
41450179,Peri-implantitis pathogenesis: Novel insights may guide therapeutic interventions.,"<h4>Background</h4>This narrative review expands on the concept of inflammation created by metal particles and ions that originate from dental implants and suggests preventative and therapeutic approaches to reduce the problem.<h4>Review</h4>A review and discussion of various etiologic factors for peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis are presented, including: foreign body response to embedded residual cement or metal particles or ions, corrosion of the titanium oxide (TiO) layer, tribocorrosion, human and animal histology and studies, treatments, prevention, and maintenance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The understanding of etiologic factors for peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis and their effect on treatment is an evolving science. Biofilm remains a primary etiologic factor. However, a foreign body response from residual cement or metal particles or ions (i.e., metallosis) has been implicated in the onset and progression of peri-implantitis. While further elucidation of risk factors is appropriate, the treatment adaptations needed to reduce metallosis are simple and easy to apply and should be considered for inclusion in routine diagnosis, therapy, and maintenance.<h4>Plain language summary</h4>Concepts regarding the etiology and management of inflammatory lesions around dental implants continue to evolve. While bacterial biofilm is widely recognized as the primary etiologic factor, additional contributors such as excess cement and metallic particles acting as foreign bodies have been increasingly emphasized in the literature. These foreign materials act synergistically with biofilm to amplify the inflammatory response. Ions and particles released from implant surfaces can initiate an immunoinflammatory cascade, ultimately resulting in peri-implant bone loss, a process referred to as metallosis. Unlike the removal of excess cement, which can often be mitigated through judicious cementation techniques or, preferably, the use of screw-retained restorations, the reduction of metallic particles presents greater clinical challenges. Such particles may originate from biofilm-induced corrosion, occlusal overload, or even therapeutic interventions aimed at treating peri-implant inflammation. Minimally invasive strategies have been proposed to address these challenges. Approaches such as the careful use of cotton pellets with sterile saline, and when indicated, the application of minimally invasive flaps under enhanced visualization, have shown promise in reducing the burden of foreign particles. Importantly, stringent oral hygiene measures and consistent maintenance therapy remain indispensable in mitigating these risks and maintaining peri-implant health.",Wilson TG Jr,"Private Practice of Periodontics, Dallas, Texas, USA.",Journal of periodontology,2025-12-26,10.1002/jper.70037,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41450711,Insights and Constraints: Understanding the Boundaries in Investigating Otosclerosis and Endolymphatic Hydrops Interaction.,"Otosclerosis and endolymphatic hydrops (EH) are distinct inner ear pathologies that may coexist within the same temporal bone, creating diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Their interaction remains controversial, with proposed mechanisms suggesting that otosclerotic involvement of the vestibular aqueduct or cochlear endosteum may obstruct endolymphatic flow, leading to secondary hydrops. This review summarizes current evidence on the coexistence, pathophysiology, diagnostic tools, and clinical implications of otosclerosis-associated EH. Histopathologic studies have demonstrated EH adjacent to otosclerotic foci involving the cochlear endosteum and the vestibular aqueduct, supporting a mechanical or metabolic interaction between both entities. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging, particularly gadolinium-enhanced 3D-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, have allowed in vivo visualization of cochlear and vestibular hydrops, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling earlier detection of mixed pathology. Clinically, affected patients often exhibit mixed or fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo, suggesting both cochlear and vestibular compromise. Post-stapedectomy EH has also been described, likely secondary to altered perilymphatic pressure or microtrauma. Despite growing evidence supporting an association, the causal relationship remains uncertain - whether EH arises as a secondary consequence of otosclerosis or represents a concurrent process within a shared pathophysiological spectrum. The coexistence of EH and otosclerosis exemplifies the complexity of inner ear disorders, highlighting the need for integrated approaches combining imaging, audiovestibular testing, and histopathologic correlation. Multidisciplinary collaboration and longitudinal studies are essential to clarify underlying mechanisms, refine diagnostic criteria, and optimize management strategies for patients with combined otosclerotic and hydropic pathology.",Castillo-Bustamante M; Guajardo-Vergara C; Armato E,"Otolaryngology, Clinica Universitaria Bolivariana, Medellín, COL.",Cureus,2025-12-23,10.7759/cureus.99962,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Otosclerosis; Peripheral Vertigo; Vestibular Disorders; Vestibular Assessment; Anatomy & Physiology
41431455,Miniaturized device for assessing calcification propensity of biohybrid implants under continuous flow.,"Biohybrid implants are a promising development for cardiovascular disease treatment but suffer from problems like thrombogenesis and calcification. However, testing and validating biohybrid implants can be difficult and expensive due to material handling, fabrication methods and specialty medium components. The devices used to test potential samples can be large and expensive, requiring significant amounts of cell culture medium to operate. Additional, conventional static cell culture conditions do not accurately represent the vascular environment as shear and mechanical forces play key roles in the development of calcification. To address these challenges, a miniaturized, dual-channel flow chamber was designed and validated that allowed for real-time visualization of biohybrid calcification in a physiological environment. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to determine the flow characteristics that generated physiological shear stress homogeneously across the sample surface. Micro particle tracking velocimetry measurements validated the simulated shear stresses near the sample surface. Two implant materials used for biohybrid construction, bovine pericardium and polycarbonate urethane, were inserted in the device and exposed to a flowing calcification medium for 14 days. Fluorescent fetuin-A was introduced into the calcification medium for real-time calcification monitoring. The two materials were compared with matched samples calcified in a large fatigue tester for 14 days. Our results showed similar material calcification for bovine pericardium and no calcification for polycarbonate urethane in the large fatigue tester and in our newly developed device. Biohybrid textile-reinforced fibrin-based scaffold populated with vascular smooth muscle cells started to calcify over 7 days in calcification medium. We conclude that this platform will provide novel insights into the origin and progression of pathological calcification and its potentially harmful health effects, which can occur as a result of tissue or metabolic abnormalities, disease, or implantation of certain biomaterials, by providing the ability to monitor the progression of calcification in biohybrid implants in real time, while also minimizing the cost and size of samples and reagents required for testing.",Morgan AD; Dzhanaev R; Gorgels A; Ritter J; Clauser JC; Stockmeier F; Stüwe L; Böhm C; Jockenhoevel S; Steinseifer U; Jahnen-Dechent W,"Helmholtz Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Biointerface Lab, RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany. willi.jahnenrwth-aachen.de.",Lab on a chip,2025-12-23,10.1039/d5lc00742a,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41423523,Occult spinal CSF leak: to patch or not to patch-a case-based update.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare condition in the pediatric population with a classic clinical presentation of severe orthostatic headaches that improve when the patient is lying down. The cause of SIH is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage either around the brain or spinal cord. When working up a patient with suspected SIH, an MRI is done, which aims to visualize the location of the leak. Visualization of the leak on imaging confirms the diagnosis of SIH and can guide localized treatments like epidural blood patch (EBP) or surgery. There has never been a reported case of a pediatric patient that presents with classic symptoms of SIH but shows completely normal findings on brain and spine imaging. Cases of adult occult SIH (oSIH) have been successfully treated with an empiric EBP; however, the use of an empiric EBP in a child with suspected oSIH has not been reported before.<h4>Methods</h4>We describe the clinical features and management of a pediatric patient with an oSIH. A literature review was done for English articles, using PubMed, to identify previously reported cases of SIH and oSIH treated with empiric EBP.<h4>Results</h4>A 9-year-old patient presented with worsening severe orthostatic headaches, nausea, phonophobia, a sensation of ear fullness, slight cognitive changes, and complete resolution of headaches when laying down. She received multiple MRIs of the brain and spine, which all found no abnormalities. She was treated for suspected post-viral syndrome and later for suspected migraines but had brief to no symptomatic relief. Her pain continued to worsen, debilitating her and causing her family distress. After being referred to our clinic, she was diagnosed with an oSIH and was treated with an empiric lumbar EBP. The patient made a profound recovery with a complete and sustained resolution of her symptoms. This shows the first pediatric case of a clinically suspected occult CSF leak with normal brain and spinal imaging, that was treated successfully with an empiric EBP after conservative treatments failed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While epidural blood patch has become a routine treatment option for SIH and a proven treatment in adult oSIH, its use in pediatric oSIH is still unclear due to the rarity of this disease. This case shows that an empiric EBP is a viable treatment option in pediatric oSIH. In situations where clinical suspicion for oSIH is high, empiric EBPs should be considered, since they have a relatively low procedural risk and can offer sustained and significant symptomatic improvement.",Wang J; Thomé AP; Brook AL; Ronda JC; Kobets AJ,"Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA. jiashu.wang@einsteinmed.edu.",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,2025-12-22,10.1007/s00381-025-07094-8,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Pediatric; Case Report; Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak; Epidural Blood Patch; Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension
41423759,Radiologic Prevalence of the Round Window Niche Veil in a Japanese Cohort Using Ultra-High-Resolution Photon-Counting Detector CT.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the in vivo radiological prevalence of the round window niche veil (RWNV) using the ultra-high-resolution (UHR) mode of photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) and to assess variations in its prevalence across different age groups in a Japanese cohort.<h4>Patients</h4>This retrospective study analyzed temporal bone PCD-CT scans from 191 consecutive patients (382 temporal bones), aged 0 to 79 years. After excluding temporal bones with middle ear opacification or prior surgery, 261 temporal bones were included in the final analysis.<h4>Intervention</h4>All imaging was performed on a clinical dual-source PCD-CT scanner using a standardized, noncontrast UHR protocol.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The presence of an RWNV was evaluated based on established radiologic criteria, requiring visualization of the characteristic soft-tissue shadow on both axial and coronal reformatted images. The primary outcome was the radiologic prevalence of the RWNV, calculated for the entire cohort and stratified by decadal age groups.<h4>Results</h4>An RWNV was identified in 66 of 261 temporal bones, yielding an overall prevalence of 25.3% (95% CI: 20.4%-30.9%). Prevalence varied across age groups, ranging from 5.3% (30-39 y) to 33.3% (40-49 y), but no consistent monotonic trend was observed with advancing age.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides the first large-scale, in vivo quantification of RWNV radiologic prevalence using UHR PCD-CT. The findings establish this advanced imaging modality as a valuable tool for noninvasively identifying this anatomic barrier, which has significant implications for predicting and potentially improving the efficacy of intratympanic drug delivery for inner ear disorders.",Sakaida H; Ichikawa Y; Yamazaki A; Sakuma H,Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.,"Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",2025-12-22,10.1097/mao.0000000000004804,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Imaging diagnosis; Photon-counting Detector Computed Tomography; Round Window Niche Veil
41442402,Characteristics of women Veterans with incident breast and gynecologic cancers in the Veterans Health Administration.,"<h4>Background</h4>There is an increase in breast and gynecologic cancer cases treated within Veterans Health Administration (VHA).<h4>Objectives</h4>To describe the age and race of Veteran women diagnosed with breast and gynecologic cancers in VHA and compare with U.S. women broadly.<h4>Design</h4>Retrospective, cross-sectional study.<h4>Methods</h4>We obtained data from January 1, 2021 to March 12, 2024 from the Breast and Gynecologic Oncology System of Excellence (BGSoE) dashboard and for women covered in the 2021 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.<h4>Results</h4>In the Veteran cohort (<i>n</i> = 6555), the median age is 59 and 58 years for breast and gynecologic cancers, respectively. ~52% (<i>n</i> = 2586) of breast cancers are diagnosed among non-Hispanic Whites, ~30% (<i>n</i> = 1519) among non-Hispanic Blacks, and 6% (<i>n</i> = 301) among Hispanics. For gynecologic cancers, ~58% (<i>n</i> = 897) are diagnosed among non-Hispanic Whites, ~23% (<i>n</i> = 359) among non-Hispanic Blacks, and ~7% (<i>n</i> = 108) among Hispanics.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared to SEER, women Veterans are diagnosed at younger ages and have similar racial composition.",Zullig LL; Shepherd-Banigan M; Cummin GL; Berkowitz TS; Melamed A; Weidenbacher H; Bayley EM; Colonna S; Hulen E; Patil V; Halwani A; Kelley MJ; Moss H,"Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation, Durham VA Health Care System, NC, USA.","Women's health (London, England)",2025-12-24,10.1177/17455057251399013,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Cancer; Women; Veterans
