40552488,NASPGHAN position statement: Enabling quality pediatric gastroenterology care through electronic health record data capture and visualization.,"Clinical practice guidelines are structured recommendations, derived from evidence-based research, aiming to inform, improve, and standardize patient care. This position paper considers the critical role the electronic health record (EHR) plays in data collection and implementation of guidelines. We describe EHR functionalities necessary to make guidelines actionable within the EHR and provide overview of data storage to inform design of data capture tools to reduce overall clinician workload. After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated the recommendation that NASPGHAN committees should develop clinical guidelines that identify specific and relevant health assessment measures with strong validity evidence, including patient-reported outcome measures. Guidelines should also outline clinical pathways, incorporating clinical decision support algorithms to provide feedback to users, and order sets to ensure the right guidance is provided for the right patient at the right time. Patient populations should be defined by using standard code sets. Committees should identify disease-specific health assessment measures with strong validity of evidence and identify areas where measures are still needed. Committees should offer guidance on population-based disease management and data visualization tools.",Lee JA; Miller S; Walsh CM; Mehta K; Watson KL; Hayes CE; Sauer C; Huang JS,"Divisions of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition and Clinical Informatics, Department of Pediatrics and Biomedical Informatics, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,2025-06-24,10.1002/jpn3.70125,14.7,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); clinical decision support(abstract); data(title,abstract); informatics(kw); electronic health record(title,abstract)",Guideline; Evidence based medicine; Informatics
40571800,Predictive modeling for early detection of refractory esophageal stricture following esophageal atresia surgery: insight from a machine learning study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Refractory esophageal stricture (RES) presents a challenging complication after esophageal atresia (EA) repair. Earlier identification of patients with RES could help clinical decision-making. However, there are currently limited articles to predict the occurrence of RES after EA repair.<h4>Methods</h4>All patients diagnosed with esophageal strictures (ES) who underwent primary endoscopic balloon dilations (EBD) after EA repair in our institution between January 2017 to December 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of suffering RES to analyze the risk factors for developing RES after EA repair and construct a predictive model using the machine learning (ML) method, based on the baseline characteristics, early postoperative complications, and ES features at the first EBD.<h4>Results</h4>92 patients were included in our study, including the RES group (n = 59) and the non-RES group (n = 33). In terms of patient demographics, multivariate analysis revealed that LGEA (p = 0.021), and anastomosis leak (p = 0.016) were the risk factors for developing RES after EA repair. Further analysis of the stricture characteristics after EA repair between the two groups revealed that esophageal stricture at a two-thirds lower level (p = 0.006), eccentric esophageal stenosis (p = 0.048), and a higher upper pouch stricture index (U-SI) (p = 0.011) emerged as significant risk factors for developing RES following EA repair. Then, we constructed ML models for predicting RES following LEAP based on patient demographics and stricture characteristics. Among all the ML models, the decision tree (DET), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models demonstrated perfect predictive value in the validation set. Among them, the RF model showed the highest average AUC in the training set (AUC = 0.756, 95% CI: 0.584-0.928), indicating better reproducibility. Subsequently, we used Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) to interpret the most important features and found that U-SI, rTEF, stricture level, and anastomotic leakage were identified as the most important predictive features. Furthermore, an RF-based clinical decision support system was deployed, providing dynamic visualization for predicting RES.<h4>Conclusion</h4>LGEA, anastomosis leak, lower stricture level, eccentric stricture, and higher U-SI value were risk factors for RES after EA repair. By utilizing the ML predictive model, we could efficiently and accurately predict the occurrence of RES.",Xie C; Wang D; Wang A; Zhao Y; Liao J; Zhang Y; Hua K; Gu Y; Du J; Sun D; Guo J; Li S; Huang J,"Department of Neonatal Surgery, Beijing Childrens Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, No. 56 Nalishi Road, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100045, China.",Pediatric surgery international,2025-06-26,10.1007/s00383-025-06094-8,8.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); clinical decision support(abstract)",Predictive model; Machine Learning; Refractory Esophageal Strictures

40569610,Generation of Fundus Fluorescein Angiography Videos for Health Care Data Sharing.,"<h4>Importance</h4>Medical data sharing faces strict restrictions. Text-to-video generation shows potential for creating realistic medical data while preserving privacy, offering a solution for cross-center data sharing and medical education.<h4>Objective</h4>To develop and evaluate a text-to-video generative artificial intelligence (AI)-driven model that converts the text of reports into dynamic fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) videos, enabling visualization of retinal vascular and structural abnormalities.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This study retrospectively collected anonymized FFA data from a tertiary hospital in China. The dataset included both the medical records and FFA examinations of patients assessed between November 2016 and December 2019. A text-to-video model was developed and evaluated. The AI-driven model integrated the wavelet-flow variational autoencoder and the diffusion transformer.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The AI-driven model's performance was assessed through objective metrics (Fréchet video distance, learned perceptual image patch similarity score, and visual question answering score [VQAScore]). The domain-specific evaluation for the generated FFA videos was measured by the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers score (BERTScore). Image retrieval was evaluated using a Recall@K score. Each video was rated for quality by 3 ophthalmologists on a scale of 1 (excellent) to 5 (very poor).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3625 FFA videos were included (2851 videos [78.6%] for training, 387 videos [10.7%] for validation, and 387 videos [10.7%] for testing). The AI-generated FFA videos demonstrated retinal abnormalities from the input text (Fréchet video distance of 2273, a mean learned perceptual image patch similarity score of 0.48 [SD, 0.04], and a mean VQAScore of 0.61 [SD, 0.08]). The domain-specific evaluations showed alignment between the generated videos and textual prompts (mean BERTScore, 0.35 [SD, 0.09]). The Recall@K scores were 0.02 for K = 5, 0.04 for K = 10, and 0.16 for K = 50, yielding a mean score of 0.073, reflecting disparities between AI-generated and real clinical videos and demonstrating privacy-preserving effectiveness. For assessment of visual quality of the FFA videos by the 3 ophthalmologists, the mean score was 1.57 (SD, 0.44).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>This study demonstrated that an AI-driven text-to-video model generated FFA videos from textual descriptions, potentially improving visualization for clinical and educational purposes. The privacy-preserving nature of the model may address key challenges in data sharing while trying to ensure compliance with confidentiality standards.",Wu X; Wang L; Chen R; Liu B; Zhang W; Yang X; Feng Y; He M; Shi D,"School of Optometry, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.",JAMA ophthalmology,2025-06-26,10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1419,4.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
40578394,Prospective quality control in chest radiography based on the reconstructed 3D human body.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Chest radiography requires effective quality control (QC) to reduce high retake rates. However, existing QC measures are all retrospective and implemented after exposure, often necessitating retakes when image quality fails to meet standards and thereby increasing radiation exposure to patients. To address this issue, we proposed a 3D human body (3D-HB) reconstruction algorithm to realize prospective QC. Our objective was to investigate the feasibility of using the reconstructed 3D-HB for prospective QC in chest radiography and evaluate its impact on retake rates.&#xD;Approach: This prospective study included patients indicated for posteroanterior (PA) and lateral (LA) chest radiography in May 2024. A 3D-HB reconstruction algorithm integrating the SMPL-X model and the HybrIK-X algorithm was proposed to convert patients' 2D images into 3D-HBs. QC metrics regarding patient positioning and collimation were assessed using chest radiographs (reference standard) and 3D-HBs, with results compared using ICCs, linear regression, and receiver operating characteristic curves. For retake rate evaluation, a real-time 3D-HB visualization interface was developed and chest radiography was conducted in two four-week phases: the first without prospective QC and the second with prospective QC. Retake rates between the two phases were compared using chi-square tests. &#xD;Main results: 324 participants were included (mean age, 42 years±19 [SD]; 145 men; 324 PA and 294 LA examinations). The ICCs for the clavicle and midaxillary line angles were 0.80 and 0.78, respectively. Linear regression showed good relation for clavicle angles (R2: 0.655) and midaxillary line angles (R2: 0.616). In PA chest radiography, the AUCs of 3D-HBs were 0.89, 0.87, 0.91 and 0.92 for assessing scapula rotation, lateral tilt, centered positioning and central X-ray alignment respectively, with 97% accuracy in collimation assessment. In LA chest radiography, the AUCs of 3D-HBs were 0.87, 0.84, 0.87 and 0.88 for assessing arms raised, chest rotation, centered positioning and central X-ray alignment respectively, with 94% accuracy in collimation assessment. In retake rate evaluation, 3995 PA and 3295 LA chest radiographs were recorded. The implementation of prospective QC based on the 3D-HB reduced retake rates from 8.6% to 3.5% (PA) and 19.6% to 4.9% (LA) (p < .001).&#xD;Significance: The reconstructed 3D-HB is a feasible tool for prospective QC in chest radiography, providing real-time feedback on patient positioning and collimation before exposure. Prospective QC based on the reconstructed 3D-HB has the potential to reshape the future of radiography QC by significantly reducing retake rates and improving clinical standardization.",Tan Y; Ye Z; Ye J; Hou Y; Li S; Liang Z; Li H; Tang J; Xia C; Li Z,"Department of Radiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37 Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, CHINA.",Physics in medicine and biology,2025-06-27,10.1088/1361-6560/ade94c,4.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw),Artificial intelligence; Quality control; Chest Radiography; 3D Human Body Reconstruction; Retake Rate
40562012,Novel Application of Connectomics to the Surgical Management of Pediatric Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Introduction The emergence of connectomics in neurosurgery has allowed for construction of detailed maps of white matter connections, incorporating both structural and functional connectivity patterns. The advantage of mapping cerebral vascular lesions to guide surgical approach shows great potential. We aim to identify the clinical utility of connectomics for the surgical treatment of pediatric arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Case Presentation We present two illustrative cases of the application of connectomics to the management of cerebral AVM in a 9-year-old and 8-year-old female. Using magnetic resonance anatomic and diffusion tensor imaging, a machine learning algorithm generated patient-specific representations of the corticospinal tract for the first patient, and the optic radiations for the second patient. The default mode network and language network were also examined for each patient. The imaging output served as an adjunct to guide operative decision making. It assisted with selection of the superior parietal lobule as the operative corridor for the first case. Furthermore, it alerted the surgeon to white matter tracts in close proximity to the AVM nidus during resection. Finally, it aided in risk versus benefit analysis regarding treatment approach, such as craniotomy for resection for the first patient versus radiosurgery for the second patient. Both patients had favorable neurologic outcomes at the available follow-up period. Conclusion Use of the software integrated well with clinical workflow. The output was used for planning and overlaid on the intraoperative neuro-navigation system. It improved visualization of eloquent regions, especially those networks not visible on standard anatomic imaging. Future studies will focus on expanding the cohort, conducting in pre- and post-operative connectomic analysis with correlation to clinical outcome measures, and incorporating functional magnetic resonance imaging.",Syed SA; Al-Mufti F; Hanft SJ; Gandhi CD; Pisapia JM,,Pediatric neurosurgery,2025-06-25,10.1159/000547100,3.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract),
40563187,Improving Hospital Delirium Screening and Documentation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Appropriate delirium screening and documentation are important for hospitalized patients to ensure positive patient outcomes and patient safety. A preliminary process review at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, identified low adherence (25.9%) to delirium screening and documentation requirements.<h4>Purpose</h4>The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to identify gaps in delirium screening and documentation, determine possible causes of these gaps, and design interventions to help improve the completion of required delirium screening and documentation over one year without adversely affecting other required nursing assessments. The target of the project was an improvement in the rate of screening documentation of at least 50%.<h4>Methods</h4>After Mayo Clinic's preliminary process review identified low adherence to delirium screening and documentation requirements, a multidisciplinary workgroup was convened, and a QI project following Six Sigma methods was implemented between May 2022 and April 2023 (the study period). Review of electronic health records (EHRs) and an informal survey of nurses and personal care assistants (enhanced by interviews and shadowing) facilitated fishbone analysis and creation of an impact-effort grid showing the relative difficulty and impact of possible interventions. An automated data-monitoring dashboard for the EHR was developed, and the Brief Confusion Assessment Method (bCAM) documentation in the EHR was restructured and introduced (first intervention). Nurse educational modules were amended to be consistent across practice areas, and a best-practice advisory (BPA) was created to bridge communication between nurses (RNs) and clinicians (physicians, NPs, and physician assistants). Delirium screening was added to the reminder list of required shift documentation in February 2023 (second intervention). A counterbalance measure, pressure injury risk, was chosen as a proxy for other required nursing assessments to show any unintentional downturn in other staff performance.<h4>Results</h4>After the bCAM redesign was introduced on June 1, 2022, delirium screening documentation decreased to 17.4% by June 30, but increased to 19.4% by July 31. After the RN educational module was implemented on July 1, delirium screening documentation increased further, to 20.7% by August, but dipped again to 13.7% by January 2023. After delirium screening was included in the required shift documentation reminder list in February 2023, delirium screening documentation significantly increased, from the baseline rate of 25.9% in May 2022 to 42.8% in March 2023 (P < 0.001) and to 47.7% in April 2023 (P < 0.001). The BPA was also associated with an increase in clinician capture of delirium diagnoses in the EHR of 47%. The rates of pressure injury risk assessment remained the same throughout the study period with only minor fluctuations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this QI project, the addition of delirium screening to shift documentation was associated with a greater than 50% increase in screening documentation, suggesting improved nurse-clinician communication. Introduction of the BPA was also associated with increased clinician capture of delirium diagnoses in the EHR. Implementing these intervention changes may improve patient outcomes and safety.",Chambers S; Boyapati RB; Gagliasso R; Griebenow L; Ayanian S; Kohler C; Pagali S,"Stephanie Chambers, Rachel Gagliasso, and Christopher Kohler are instructors in nursing, Renu Bhargavi Boyapati is a research fellow in the Division of Hospital Internal Medicine, Linda Griebenow is an assistant professor of nursing, Shant Ayanian is an assistant professor of medicine, and Sandeep Pagali is an associate professor of medicine, all at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

40553667,Bedside Ultrasound Vector Doppler Imaging System with GPU Processing and Deep Learning.,"Recent innovations in vector flow imaging promise to bring the modality closer to clinical application and allow for more comprehensive high-frame-rate vascular assessments. One such innovation is plane-wave multi-angle vector Doppler, where pulsed Doppler principles from multiple steering angles are used to realize vector flow imaging at frame rates upward of 1,000 frames per second (fps). Currently, vector Doppler is limited by the presence of aliasing artifacts that have prevented its reliable realization at the bedside. In this work, we present a new aliasing-resistant vector Doppler imaging system that can be deployed at the bedside using a programmable ultrasound core, graphics processing unit (GPU) processing, and deep learning principles. The framework supports two operational modes: 1) live imaging at 17 fps where vector flow imaging serves to guide image view navigation in blood vessels with complex dynamics; 2) on-demand replay mode where flow data acquired at high frame rates of over 1,000 fps is depicted as a slow-motion playback at 60 fps using an aliasing-resistant vector projectile visualization. Using our new system, aliasing-free vector flow cineloops were successfully obtained in a stenosis phantom experiment and in human bifurcation imaging scans. This system represents a major engineering advance towards the clinical adoption of vector flow imaging.",Nahas H; Yiu BYS; Chee AJY; Ishii T; Yu ACH,,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2025-06-24,10.1109/tuffc.2025.3582773,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40549161,BrainNet-GAN: Generative Adversarial Graph Convolutional Network for Functional Brain Network Synthesis from Routine Clinical Brain Structural T1-Weighted Sequence.,"Functional brain network (FBN) derived from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has promising prospects in clinical research, but fMRI is not a routine acquisition data, which limits its popularity in clinical applications. Therefore, it is imperative to generate FBN based on routine clinical structural MRI brain network. In this study, a BrainNet-GAN model was proposed for generating FBN from radiomics-based morphological brain network (radMBN) derived from routinely acquired T1-weighted image (T1WI). BrainNet-GAN integrated two Multi-Channel Multi-Scale Adaptive (Multi<sup>2</sup>Ada) generators and two (Local_to_Global) discriminators. In the generator, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) was used inside each channel to aggregate multi-scale information between direct or indirect neighbors of nodes, and the output of each channel was adaptively fused through several sets of learnable coefficients; In the discriminator, Multi-channel GCN was used to aggregate local nodes information, and a feature selection module was designed to establish correlations between feature maps at different channels. Additionally, a Multi-Angle Multi-Constraint (MAMC) loss function was proposed, which could guide the learning process of the model from different aspects. Experiments with 2116 subjects in two publicly available datasets showed that BrainNet-GAN model exhibited promising performance on the task of generating FBN. Meanwhile, the individual-level brain network visualization was displayed with high consistency in generated FBN and target FBN. Further, the Top 10 brain regions identified by four graph-theory analysis metrics also exhibited with consistency.

40552765,A Wearable Dual-Modal Patch for Rapid Pre-Hospital Diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction.,"Timely diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the prehospital phase is crucial to decrease mortality rates. Given that certain patients may not exhibit typical alterations in their electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns during the initial phases, the diagnosis of AMI is typically achieved by simultaneously assessing ECG results and myocardial injury biomarkers. This procedure requires the use of specialized equipment and trained personnel that are only available in hospitals, which may lead to possible delays of several hours. The development of a device that can detect both ECG and acute myocardial injury markers in the prehospital setting remains a significant challenge. In this study, a wearable dual-modal patch that combines a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) microneedle array with flexible electronics is introduced for the prehospital diagnosis of AMI. The patch allows for the noninvasive and rapid monitoring of both ECG and the levels of three myocardial injury markers in the interstitial fluid (ISF) by a portable Raman spectrometer, in accordance with the established clinical standard. This strategy was validated through experiments conducted on rats induced with AMI. The time required for diagnosing ischemia was significantly reduced to 50 min after its onset. The patch is optimally integrated into a stamp-sized band-aid, accompanied by a smartphone app for data visualization and real-time analysis. This initiative aims to facilitate the prompt delivery of interventions to reduce ischemic events.",Yang K; Dong Q; Yao Z; Liang J; Zhao J; Wu L; Zong S; Cui Y; Wang Z,"Advanced Photonics Center, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China.",ACS nano,2025-06-24,10.1021/acsnano.5c05461,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Acute myocardial infarction; Electrocardiograms; Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering; Myocardial Injury Markers; Wearable Patches
40570535,Deep learning-based diffusion MRI tractography: Integrating spatial and anatomical information.,"Diffusion MRI tractography technique enables non-invasive visualization of the white matter pathways in the brain. It plays a crucial role in neuroscience and clinical fields by facilitating the study of brain connectivity and neurological disorders. However, the accuracy of reconstructed tractograms has been a longstanding challenge. Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to improve tractograms for better white matter coverage, but often comes at the expense of generating excessive false-positive connections. This is largely due to their reliance on local information to predict long-range streamlines. To improve the accuracy of streamline propagation predictions, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that integrates image-domain spatial information and anatomical information along tracts, with the former extracted through convolutional layers and the latter modeled via a Transformer-decoder. Additionally, we employ a weighted loss function to address fiber class imbalance encountered during training. We evaluate the proposed method on the simulated ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge dataset, achieving a valid streamline rate of 66.2 %, white matter coverage of 63.8 %, and successfully reconstructing 24 out of 25 bundles. Furthermore, on the multi-site Tractoinferno dataset, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to handle various diffusion MRI acquisition schemes, achieving a 5.7 % increase in white matter coverage and a 4.1 % decrease in overreach compared to RNN-based methods.",Yang Y; Yuan Y; Ren B; Wu Y; Feng Y; Zhang X,"School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Image Processing and Guangdong Province Engineering Laboratory for Medical Imaging and Diagnostic Technology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.",NeuroImage,2025-06-25,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2025.121314,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Diffusion Mri; Tractography; Cnn; Deep Learning; Self-attention Mechanism
40575111,IBS May Have a Causal Effect on Increased Tryptophan Metabolites Levels: Insights from a Bidirectional Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Tryptophan, an essential amino acid derived from dietary proteins, can be metabolized into various compounds by the gut microbiome. Emerging evidence suggests that tryptophan metabolites play a role in functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, the causal relationship between tryptophan metabolites and IBS remains to be fully elucidated.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to evaluate the potential causal relationship between tryptophan metabolites and IBS using Mendelian randomization (MR).<h4>Methods</h4>Instrumental variables (IVs) were selected from summary data of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for tryptophan and IBS. SNPs potentially influencing MR results were excluded through outlier detection using MR-PRESSO. Bidirectional two-sample MR analyses were conducted using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode methods. The MR-Egger intercept test was employed to assess pleiotropy and heterogeneity among IVs, with visualization of the MR results through scatter plots, funnel plots, and forest plots.<h4>Results</h4>Genetically predicted tryptophan metabolites were not associated with the risk of IBS. In the reverse direction, genetically predicted IBS was associated with increased levels of tryptophan, serotonin, and kynurenine in the IVW analysis. Sensitivity and replication analyses confirmed these findings.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings of this Mendelian randomization study suggest that IBS may lead to elevated levels of tryptophan, serotonin, and kynurenine. These results have important implications for understanding the interplay between tryptophan metabolism and IBS in clinical settings. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms.",Cheng P; Jia R; Jin B; Zhou F; Xu H; Wang B,"Department of Gastroenterology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.",International journal of tryptophan research : IJTR,2025-06-25,10.1177/11786469251327399,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),irritable bowel syndrome; Kynurenine; Mendelian Randomization; Causal Relationship; Tryptophan Metabolites
40570265,Efficacy of Multimodal Psychological Interventions on Pain After Surgery in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Postsurgical pain is common among people who undergo breast cancer (BC) surgery and affects health-related quality of life. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the efficacy of multimodal psychologic interventions to reduce pain after BC surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>Nine bibliographic databases and three trial registries were searched from their inception to September 2024. Studies were included if they reported pain outcomes of multimodal psychologic interventions performed after BC surgery. This systematic review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024506835) and followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and synthesis without meta-analysis guidelines.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 2,876 studies were screened, with 18 meeting inclusion criteria including 10 randomized control trials (55.6%). There was a total of 1,712 patients (median sample size was 77). The greatest proportion of studies were conducted in the United States (n = 7, 38.9%). Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) was the most investigated intervention (4/18, 22.2%), followed by yoga (3/18, 16.7%). The most used pain questionnaires were the Brief Pain Inventory and European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (5/18, 27.8%). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (n = 1), relaxation modification (n = 1), progressive muscular relaxation combined with visualization (n = 1), Qigong mind-body exercise (n = 1), pranic meditation (n = 1), supportive-expressive group therapy (n = 1), diaphragmatic breathing with progressive muscle relaxation (n = 1), and integrated yoga programs (n = 3) demonstrated a significant reduction in pain.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings indicate the potential for multimodal psychologic interventions to reduce pain after BC surgery. However, MBSR was not significantly effective in pain reduction for BC survivors despite being the most frequently investigated intervention.

40576127,3D Auto-segmentation of pancreas cancer and surrounding anatomical structures for surgical planning.,"<h4>Background</h4>This multicenter study aimed to develop a deep learning-based autosegmentation model for pancreatic cancer and surrounding anatomical structures using computed tomography (CT) to enhance surgical planning.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We included patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreatic surgery at three tertiary referral hospitals. A hierarchical Swin Transformer V2 model was implemented to segment the pancreas, pancreatic cancers, and peripancreatic structures from preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans. Data was divided into training and internal validation sets at a 3:1 ratio (from one tertiary institution), with separately prepared external validation set (from two separate institutions). Segmentation performance was quantitatively assessed using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and qualitatively evaluated (complete vs partial vs absent).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 275 patients (51.6% male, mean age 65.8 ± 9.5 years) were included (176 training group, 59 internal validation group, and 40 external validation group). No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between the groups. The model achieved an overall mean DSC of 75.4 ± 6.0 and 75.6 ± 4.8 in the internal and external validation groups, respectively. It showed high accuracy particularly in the pancreas parenchyma (84.8 ± 5.3 and 86.1 ± 4.1) and lower accuracy in pancreatic cancer (57.0 ± 28.7 and 54.5 ± 23.5). The DSC scores for pancreatic cancer tended to increase with larger tumor sizes. Moreover, the qualitative assessments revealed high accuracy in the superior mesenteric artery (complete segmentation, 87.5%-100%), portal and superior mesenteric vein (97.5%-100%), pancreas parenchyma (83.1%-87.5%), but lower accuracy in cancers (62.7%-65.0%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The deep learning-based autosegmentation model for 3D visualization of pancreatic cancer and peripancreatic structures showed robust performance.

40574468,An overview and evaluation of first-trimester physiological fetal human anatomy using 3-dimensional ultrasound combined with virtual reality techniques.,"<h4>Study question</h4>What (physiological) first-trimester fetal anatomic structures can be discerned by ultrasound (US) and can these structures be visualized using 3-dimensional (3D) US combined with virtual reality (VR) in a prospective clinical setting?<h4>Summary answer</h4>3D US combined with VR techniques has shown to be applicable for the assessment of fetal anatomy in the first trimester and may serve as a valuable tool for both professional training and patient counseling.<h4>What is known already</h4>Due to technological developments, new imaging modalities are becoming available and the visualization of fetal anatomic structures continues to improve. Consequently, in recent years, the focus of antenatal US screening has progressively shifted toward the first trimester of pregnancy. To further assess the applicability of new imaging techniques in detecting anomalies it is essential first to demonstrate the visibility of physiological fetal anatomy. Until today, an extended overview of first-trimester physiological fetal structures discernable by US is missing and most knowledge on first-trimester fetal anatomy is still based on imaging modalities other than US evaluating ex vivo human subjects.<h4>Study design, size, duration</h4>A systematic literature search was performed by two independent reviewers in five electronic databases. All studies published between January 1946 and January 2024 in the English language, assessing ultrasonically discernible fetal structures in the first trimester of pregnancy were included. Subsequent, a literature-based checklist of ultrasonically discernible first-trimester fetal structures was developed. According to the constructed checklist, an offline VR assessment of 3D and 4-dimensional (4D) US datasets for discernable fetal structures was conducted.<h4>Participants/materials, setting, methods</h4>In 55 high-risk pregnancies between a gestational age (GA) of 11+0-13+6 weeks 3D and 4D US datasets were collected prospectively and selected based on their quality. The US datasets were offline evaluated for discernable fetal structures as indicated on the predetermined checklist using VR by two trained observers. After offline VR assessment, visibility rates for all ultrasonically discernible structures were calculated as a proportion of the total number of US datasets.<h4>Main results and the role of chance</h4>A systematic literature search (N = 15 874 studies retrieved) resulted in the inclusion and quality assessment of 372 studies, from which 81 ultrasonically discernible fetal structures were identified and incorporated into the checklist. An offline VR assessment was performed in 3D and 4D US datasets of 55 pregnancies with a mean GA of 12 + 6 weeks (SD 0.4 days). The mean visibility rate of all fetal structures incorporated in the checklist was 82.2%.<h4>Limitations, reasons for caution</h4>A key limitation of this study is the lack of targeted US examination during the acquisition of all 3D and 4D US datasets. A targeted approach could improve dataset quality and visibility rates in the offline evaluation of fetal anatomy using 3D US and VR. Additionally, the selection of high-quality 3D US datasets may introduce selection bias, which could impact the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, since the study population was recruited from a tertiary referral center where US examinations were performed by experienced sonographers using a high-frequency transvaginal US transducer, there may be limitations in extrapolating these results to the broader general population, where access to such specialized expertise and equipment may be more limited.<h4>Wider implications of the findings</h4>This is the first comprehensive literature-based overview of first-trimester physiological fetal structures discernable by US, which has been evaluated in a prospective clinical setting. Moreover, this study underlines the potential added value of the use of 3D US combined with VR, both as educational and reference resource for professionals and counseling in daily clinical practice.<h4>Study funding/competing interest(s)</h4>No specific funding was used for the execution of this study.

40549818,Buddha image meditation is a potent predictor for mental health outcomes: A cross-sectional study among Thai high-school students.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Meditation has been demonstrated to benefit adolescent mental health. This research examined various meditation styles practiced in northern Thailand to determine which were associated with positive and negative mental health outcomes in adolescents.<h4>Population and methods</h4>High school students who were 15-18 years old and who were enrolled in grades 10-12 in either secular or Buddhist Thai boarding schools were recruited following their school's willingness to participate. They provided information about meditation styles and their practice frequency during the last month (i.e., breathing, kasina (color), Buddha image visualization, Manomayiddhi, mindfulness, recollections, and vipassanā). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Resilience Inventory (RI-9), Outcome Inventory-21 (OI-21), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were completed. Multiple linear regression model analysis was used to identify the effects of meditation styles on mental health outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Among 443 participants, 390 were females (87.9%). The mean age was 16.35 ± 0.96 years. The three most common meditation styles practiced were breathing, Buddha image visualization, and mindfulness (46.5%, 26.2%, and 22.8%, respectively). Buddha image visualization was a significant predictor of RSES (B = 1.69, 95%CI = 0.77, 2.61), RI-9 (B = 2.95, 95%CI = 0.68, 2.95), OI-Anxiety (B = -2.38, 95%CI = -3.34, -1.41), OI-Depression (B = -1.94, 95%CI = -2.64, -1.24), and PSS-10 (B = -2.47, 95%CI = -3.65, -1.28), whereas Manomayiddhi was a predictor of RI-9 (B = 2.47, 95%CI = 0.74, 2.47), OI-Anxiety (B = -2.32, 95%CI = -3.41, -1.23), OI-Depression (B = -1.53, 95%CI = -2.32, -0.74), and PSS-10 (B = -2.14, 95%CI = -3.46, -0.81). Breathing meditation predicted OI-Depression (B = -0.87, 95%CI = -1.45, -0.29). Daily meditation frequency was associated with the best mental health scores (p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Buddha image visualization, Manomayiddhi, and breathing meditation were predictive of adolescents' mental health. A higher practice frequency is associated with positive mental health outcomes.",DeMaranville J; Wongpakaran T; Wongpakaran N; Wedding D,"Mental Health Program, Multidisciplinary and Interdisciplinary School, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.",PloS one,2025-06-23,10.1371/journal.pone.0326432,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40569078,Multifunctional metal-organic frameworks and their heterojunction materials for cancer theranostics.,"Malignant tumours continue to present a significant challenge to global public health, with early theranostics serving as critical strategies to enhance patient prognosis. Advancements in nanotechnology have catalyzed the development of innovative approaches, where the synergy between nanomaterials and therapeutic modalities offers promising solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional cancer treatments. Among these innovations, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a focal point of research in cancer theranostics. Their three-dimensional porous structure, precisely tunable pore sizes, excellent biocompatibility, and versatile surface functionalization make them particularly attractive. Additionally, the controllable synthesis and ordered structural characteristics of MOFs enable the integration of functional nanoparticles through hierarchical assembly strategies, resulting in heterojunction systems with various configurations, such as ""core-shell"", ""moon-star"", ""yolk-shell"", and ""Janus"" structures. These materials demonstrate synergistic effects in cancer treatment, often outperforming single MOF materials. This review comprehensively discusses the latest advancements in single and double metal MOFs, as well as their heterojunction-derived materials, in tumour visualization, targeted therapy, and integrated theranostics.

40562676,From Faster Frames to Flawless Focus: Deep Learning HASTE in Postoperative Single Sequence MRI.,"<h4>Background</h4>This study evaluates the feasibility of a novel deep learning-accelerated half-fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo sequence (HASTE-DL) compared to the conventional HASTE sequence (HASTE<sub>S</sub>) in postoperative single-sequence MRI for the detection of fluid collections following abdominal surgery. As small fluid collections are difficult to visualize using other techniques, HASTE-DL may offer particular advantages in this clinical context.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A retrospective analysis was conducted on 76 patients (mean age 65±11.69 years) who underwent abdominal MRI for suspected septic foci following abdominal surgery. Imaging was performed using 3-T MRI scanners, and both sequences were analyzed in terms of image quality, contrast, sharpness, and artifact presence. Quantitative assessments focused on fluid collection detectability, while qualitative assessments evaluated visualization of critical structures. Inter-reader agreement was measured using Cohen's kappa coefficient, and statistical significance was determined with the Mann-Whitney U test.<h4>Results</h4>HASTE-DL achieved a 46% reduction in scan time compared to HASTE<sub>S</sub>, while significantly improving overall image quality (p<0.001), contrast (p<0.001), and sharpness (p<0.001). The inter-reader agreement for HASTE-DL was excellent (κ=0.960), with perfect agreement on overall image quality and fluid collection detection (κ=1.0). Fluid detectability and characterization scores were higher for HASTE-DL, and visualization of critical structures was significantly enhanced (p<0.001). No relevant artifacts were observed in either sequence.<h4>Conclusion</h4>HASTE-DL offers superior image quality, improved visualization of critical structures, such as drainages, vessels, bile and pancreatic ducts, and reduced acquisition time, making it an effective alternative to the standard HASTE sequence, and a promising complementary tool in the postoperative imaging workflow.",Hosse C; Fehrenbach U; Pivetta F; Malinka T; Wagner M; Walter-Rittel T; Gebauer B; Kolck J; Geisel D,"Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Department of Radiology, Berlin, Germany (C.H., U.F., F.P., M.W., T.W.R., B.G., J.K., D.G.).

40555526,Tale of two approaches to ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block: a pro-con.,"The interscalene brachial plexus block is a well-described and widely used peripheral nerve block effective for regional anesthesia and analgesia in orthopedic surgical procedures of the shoulder, upper arm, and clavicle. Conventionally, an in-plane ultrasound-guided approach has been the technique of choice, while the out-of-plane approach, though less described, has been gaining anecdotal momentum among a growing number of proceduralists. This pro-con discussion highlights the out-of-plane approach's goal of avoiding needle injuries to nerves that course through the middle scalene muscle and the in-plane approach's benefit of whole-shaft needle visualization and increased distance away from the plexus on entry.

40557780,"Now You See It, Now You Don't: Laryngoscopy Findings of Paradoxical Vocal Fold Motion.","<h4>Objective</h4>The key exam finding in the diagnosis of paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM) is visualization of adduction of the true vocal folds during inspiration on laryngoscopy. This study aims to assess the reliability of visualizing PVFM on laryngoscopic exam.<h4>Methods</h4>Laryngoscopic exams of 60 patients being evaluated for PVFM were rated by 13 individual otolaryngologists at 2 different timepoints, 1 month apart. At the second timepoint, half of the exams were accompanied by a clinical history potentially suggestive of PVFM. Raters were asked to determine whether patients exhibited PVFM on the video shown, the degree of adduction of the vocal folds (complete, partial, or none), and the level of certainty with the diagnosis. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were calculated using Fleiss' and Cohen's kappa, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>Interpretation of the presence of PVFM was quite variable. There was only fair inter-rater reliability (Fleiss' kappa = 0.36 at Timepoint 1 and 0.34 at Timepoint 2) and moderate to fair intra-rater reliability (median Cohen's kappa = 0.47 for videos without clinical history and 0.36 for videos shown with clinical histories). Ratings on degree of adduction were quite heterogeneous.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Though laryngoscopic findings of PVFM are the gold standard physical exam finding in support of diagnosis, only fair agreement was found when raters assessed laryngoscopy recordings for PVFM. Intra-rater reliability was also quite varied. Improvement in assessment of vocal fold function and understanding the role of clinical history in diagnosis may improve the care of patients with suspected PVFM.<h4>Level of evidence: 3</h4>",Strober W; Naunheim MR; Rohlfing ML; Kallogjeri D; Piccirillo JF; Huston MN,"Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.",The Laryngoscope,2025-06-25,10.1002/lary.32367,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),reliability; Laryngoscopy; Paradoxical Vocal Fold Motion
40554976,Ensemble-based Convolutional Neural Networks for brain tumor classification in MRI: Enhancing accuracy and interpretability using explainable AI.,"<h4>Background</h4>Accurate and efficient classification of brain tumors, including gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary adenomas, is critical for early diagnosis and treatment planning. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key diagnostic tool, and deep learning models have shown promise in automating tumor classification. However, challenges remain in achieving high accuracy while maintaining interpretability for clinical use.<h4>Methods</h4>This study explores the use of transfer learning with pre-trained architectures, including VGG16, DenseNet121, and Inception-ResNet-v2, to classify brain tumors from MRI images. An ensemble-based classifier was developed using a majority voting strategy to improve robustness. To enhance clinical applicability, explainability techniques such as Grad-CAM++ and Integrated Gradients were employed, allowing visualization of model decision-making.<h4>Results</h4>The ensemble model outperformed individual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, achieving an accuracy of 86.17% in distinguishing gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, and benign cases. Interpretability techniques provided heatmaps that identified key regions influencing model predictions, aligning with radiological features and enhancing trust in the results.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed ensemble-based deep learning framework improves the accuracy and interpretability of brain tumor classification from MRI images.

40545498,Virtual cutaneous area severity index (vCASI): A comprehensive methodology for quantitative skin disease assessment on positron emission tomography images.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Quantification of skin diseases such as cutaneous lymphoma or psoriasis is important for pretreatment planning and response assessment. Currently, this quantification relies on clinical assessments, which are cumbersome, error-prone, and subject to inter-reader variability. FDG-PET/CT is a widely used molecular imaging technique for non-invasive detection and quantification of metabolically active disorders, providing biomarkers of disease extent, severity, and therapeutic response. However, skin disease quantification from PET/CT images remains challenging, error-prone, and labor-intensive.<h4>Methods</h4>We proposed a novel comprehensive methodology called virtual Cutaneous Area Severity Index (vCASI) to quantitatively assess the extent and severity of metabolically active skin disease from FDG-PET/CT images. Firstly, we used an automated body region localization method, followed by a standardization technique for PET images to reduce interscan measurement variability. Then, we generated skin shell PET images and developed a standardized Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) rendering technique to enable reproducible 3D visualization of the skin with the disease. Finally, we introduced and validated a new quantitative scoring system (vCASI score) to measure the extent and severity of skin disease via these renderings.<h4>Results</h4>Correlations between vCASI scores and reference standard ground-truth assessments increased following the standardization of PET images, further improved with the use of adjusted mean of maximum percentile intensity values as the reference point for MIP rendering, and reached as high as 0.605. Additionally, correlations between repeated vCASI score assessments for the torso, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis exceeded 0.85, demonstrating high repeatability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The vCASI methodology allows for accurate and reproducible quantitative assessment of the extent and severity of metabolically active skin diseases, such as cutaneous lymphoma and psoriasis, from FDG-PET/CT images. It addresses the challenges related to body region localization, non-standardness of PET images, robust visualization, and standardized display of PET images to detect and quantify skin disease. Additionally, it overcomes the lack of a practical and validated scoring system for quantifying skin disease on PET images. We demonstrated that the vCASI scoring system has high repeatability and good accuracy, and is optimized by the proposed methodology.",Mortazi A; Udupa JK; Hosseini M; Tong Y; Torigian DA,"Medical Image Processing Group, Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,2025-06-23,10.1007/s00259-025-07423-8,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Positron emission tomography; Psoriasis; Quantification; Skin Disease; Scoring System; Cutaneous Lymphoma
40578539,Idebenone attenuates RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and improves bone mass in ovariectomized mice.,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP), driven by estrogen deficiency-induced osteoclast overactivation, poses a significant global health burden with limited therapeutic options. In this study, we investigated the potential of Idebenone (IDB) as a therapeutic agent for PMOP, focusing on its effects on osteoclast differentiation and underlying molecular mechanisms. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were cultured and stimulated to induce osteoclast differentiation, with or without IDB treatment. IDB's effects on osteoclast formation were assessed via TRAcP staining, F-actin ring visualization, resorption pit assays, and Western blotting. Network pharmacology highlighted the protein kinase B (AKT) as a key target, corroborated by molecular docking and CETSA showing IDB-AKT interaction. We found that IDB suppressed osteoclast differentiation and activity through reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting the AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In vivo, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were treated with IDB (50 mg/kg) for six weeks, followed by micro-CT and histomorphometric analysis to evaluate bone microstructure and osteoclast activity. Notably, in OVX mice, IDB treatment significantly improved bone mass compared to controls. These findings suggested that IDB may serve as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis by modulating osteoclast differentiation and inhibiting AKT pathways.",Yu C; Cai L; Zhuang L; Wu Y; Wu Q; Liang H; Shi M; Miao J; Song H; Jin H; Pan Y,"Department of Endocrinology, the 2nd Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The 2nd School of Medicine, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.",Free radical biology & medicine,2025-06-25,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2025.06.043,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Oxidative stress; Osteoporosis; Osteoclast; idebenone; Rankl
40576077,A Multivalent Targeting Strategy for Developing Reactive Oxygen Species-Activated Tumor-Seeking Probe to Guide Precise Surgical Resection.,"Optical molecular imaging with near-infrared (NIR) dyes provides a promising strategy for the visual detection of tumor tissues. However, conventional molecular probes often suffer from poor targeting specificity and low signal contrast during tumor detection. In this work, we developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activated tumor-seeking probe (termed MB-PEG-Bio2) based on a multivalent biotin-targeting strategy. A bivalent biotin targeting ligand was bonded to an ROS-responsive molecular scaffold to maximize receptor-ligand interactions, resulting in significantly stronger tumor affinity and selectivity of the probe. The optical signal of the proposed probe was initially masked and could be selectively activated by overexpressed ROS levels in the tumor microenvironment. This activation led to the specific release of the clinical dye methylene blue (MB), offering high-contrast NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging signals for precise tumor visualization. MB-PEG-Bio2 demonstrated strong tumor selectivity, enabling the detection of tumors in different mice models, including accurate identification of small tumors (~3 mm). Consequently, the probe could delineate tumor boundaries during fluorescence-guided surgery, significantly reducing postoperative tumor recurrence.",Liu F; Liu L; Zhang M; Li J; Li M; Wei P; Yi T,"Guangxi University, School of Medicine, CHINA.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2025-06-27,10.1002/anie.202510441,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Reactive oxygen species; Imaging; Fluorescence-guided Surgery; Multivalent Targeting; Tumor-seeking Probe

Both patients underwent thoracoscopic treatment in which the abscess was opened, debrided, and lavaged with a combination of sharp dissection and use of a vessel-sealing device. One patient required partial conversion from total thoracoscopic treatment to a thoracoscopic-assisted approach due to limited visualization of the caudal mediastinum.<h4>Results</h4>Both dogs recovered uneventfully from surgery and were discharged 3 and 4 days postoperatively. Case 1 was re-evaluated with their primary veterinarian 7 days postoperatively and was reported to be doing very well. Case 2 returned 69 days postoperatively for examination and thoracic radiographs. Physical examination was unremarkable and thoracic radiography identified mildly increased soft tissue opacity in the region of the esophagus.

40578711,Clustering Analysis of Antibiotic Resistance in Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria from Spoiled Vegetables.,"Antibiotic resistance in foodborne bacteria is a growing public health concern, particularly in fresh produce. This study evaluates multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) isolated from spoiled zucchini, cucumber, and potato collected from Sabia, Abu Arish, and Samta in the Jazan region. Bacterial isolates were cultured on MacConkey and Mannitol salt agar, followed by Gram staining to identify three Gram-negative (KMcS, CMcA, PMcSa) and three Gram-positive (KMS, CMA, PMSa) isolates. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed against Penicillin (P), Streptomycin (S), Cefotaxime (CTX), Chloramphenicol (C), Ofloxacin (OF), and Erythromycin (E). The inhibition zones varied across antibiotics, with Ofloxacin exhibiting the largest inhibition zones (40-50 mm) and Cefotaxime and Erythromycin showing the weakest inhibition (≤14 mm). The Resistance Index (RI), which represents the proportion of antibiotics with no inhibition, ranged from 0.2 (moderate resistance) to 0.6 (high resistance in the PMcSa isolate). ANOVA (p ≈ 6.95e-08) confirmed significant differences in inhibition zones across antibiotics, while Tukey's HSD test showed that Ofloxacin was significantly more effective than both Cefotaxime (p = 0.0005) and Erythromycin (p = 0.0035). Correlation analysis revealed strong positive associations between resistance to Chloramphenicol, Streptomycin, and Ofloxacin (r > 0.7), suggesting potential cross-resistance mechanisms. Hierarchical clustering and KMeans analysis (K=3) grouped bacterial isolates based on their resistance patterns, while PCA visualization distinguished Ofloxacin-sensitive and multidrug-resistant isolates. The findings highlight an urgent need for targeted antibiotic stewardship programs, especially in agricultural practices, to limit the overuse of antibiotics.

40550699,"Pituitary Photon Counting Detector CT for Cushing Disease: Pre-operative Lesion Localization, Intraoperative Findings, and Post-operative Outcomes.","<h4>Background and purpose</h4>MRI fails to localize a tumor in up to 40% of cases of ACTH dependent Cushing Disease (CD), impacting patient outcomes and creating uncertainty in the diagnosis. Photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) is a new CT technology with better imaging performance than conventional CT. PCD-CT is a novel imaging technique for CD, especially for MR-negative cases, however its application to CD remains unknown.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We present a cohort of consecutive patients with a pre-operative PCD-CT undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for CD at a single institution from September 2023 to January 2025. All patients underwent gadolinium-enhanced pituitary MRI for baseline work-up and PCD-CT as part of their preoperative planning imaging. Both imaging modalities were used to localize the lesion and guide surgical planning. The accuracies of MRI and PCD-CT were based on confirmation of the lesion location by a combination of intraoperative visualization, pathologic confirmation, and postoperative biochemical remission, and were compared with each other via Fisher's exact test.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-five patients with CD were included in this analysis. The cohort's median age was 50 years old, and 88% were female. At diagnosis, 88% had central obesity, 76% had hypertension, 48% had type II diabetes mellitus, and 20% had osteoporosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI accurately identified 56% of lesions, while it was negative in 24% and misleading in 20%. Dynamic contrast-enhanced PCD-CT was superior in localizing CD (p=0.01), accurately identifying 92% of lesions, while it was negative in 4% and misleading in 4% of cases. Early postoperative biochemical remission was achieved in 88% of cases, while 84% remained in remission at follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PCD-CT had a high rate of adenoma localization confirmed intraoperatively, even among MR-negative cases, potentially leading to high remission and gland preservation rates. Its role in the clinical workflow of preoperative evaluation for CD requires further investigation, but current evidence supports its value in lesion localization, especially in MR-negative disease.<h4>Abbreviations</h4>CD＝ cushing disease; PCD＝ photon counting detector.",Mark IT; Michalopoulos G; Van Gompel J; Celda MP; Bancos I; Donegan D; Gruber LM; Erickson D; Nagelschneider AA; Yu L,"From the Department of Radiology (I.T.M, A.A.N., L.Y.), Department of Neurosurgery (G.M., J.V.G., M.P.C.), and Department of Endocrinology (I.B., D.D., L.M.G., D.E.,), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.",AJNR.

40202353,Time to Enhancement of Foci Relative to Background Parenchymal Enhancement on Ultrafast Breast MRI: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>. Breast MRI is a sensitive tool for detecting small cancers. However, differentiating benign and malignant lesions remains challenging, particularly for foci. Studies evaluating other lesion types have identified ultrafast MRI (UFMRI) parameters associated with malignancy. <b>OBJECTIVE</b>. The purpose of this study was to determine whether kinetic features of UFMRI can differentiate malignant from nonmalignant foci. <b>METHODS</b>. This single-center retrospective study selected consecutive UFMRI examinations conducted from July 2019 to April 2023 with subsequently performed MRI-guided biopsy. Patient characteristics and lesion features were collected from the EMR, imaging reports, and imaging review. Focus and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), time to enhancement (TTE), and the difference between focus TTE and BPE TTE were calculated. Associations with malignancy were assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression. <b>RESULTS</b>. A total of 124 patients (mean age, 53 years old; range, 29-78 years old) underwent biopsy of 124 foci. Sixty-four patients (51.6%) were postmenopausal, 71 (57.3%) had a personal history of breast cancer, and 81 (65.3%) had a family history of breast cancer. Of the 94 patients who underwent genetic testing, 33 (35.3%) had genetic mutations. Most examinations were performed to evaluate the extent of disease (47.6% [59/124]), followed by screening (41.9% [52/124]). Patients predominantly had heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue (58.1% [72/124]) and mild BPE (57.3% [71/124]). Of 124 lesions, 21 (16.9%) were malignant; of these, 16 were invasive and five were ductal carcinoma in situ. The odds of malignancy increased 5% with each 1-second increase in the difference between lesion TTE and BPE TTE (95% CI, 2-9%; <i>p</i> = .006). Older age and lower BPE were associated with increased likelihood of malignancy (<i>p</i> = .005 and <i>p</i> = .02, respectively). The odds of malignancy for patients with minimal or mild BPE were 11.69 times the odds for those with moderate or marked BPE (95% CI, 1.51-90.67). No other demographic or lesion characteristics were predictive of malignancy. <b>CONCLUSION</b>. Earlier visualization of a focus relative to BPE on UFMRI was associated with increased likelihood of malignancy; morphologic features showed no association with malignancy. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT</b>. The difference between focus TTE and BPE TTE may be a useful parameter for assessing malignancy, which could help reduce unnecessary biopsies.",Regen-Tuero HC; Gao Y; Li X; Noorily A; Goldberg JD; Heller SL,"Department of Radiology, NYU Langone Health, 660 First Ave, New York, NY 10016.",AJR.

40567511,Endoscopic Posterior Cervical Foraminotomy and Discectomy.,"<h4>Background</h4>Open posterior cervical foraminotomy has been shown to be comparable with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy<sup>1,2</sup>. More recently, posterior endoscopic cervical foraminotomy was described as an ultra-minimally invasive technique that allows for neural decompression in cervical radiculopathy. This technique has been shown to have excellent clinical outcomes with a short length of hospital stay and low postoperative pain levels<sup>3</sup>.<h4>Description</h4>The procedure is performed with the patient in the prone position under general anesthesia. Fluoroscopy is utilized to mark out the incision and target the medial-most aspect of the facet at the level of foraminal stenosis. Sequential dilators are then inserted to create a working canal, and the endoscope is introduced. Soft tissue is cleared until the classic ""V"" interlaminar anatomic landmark is visualized. The superior edge of the cephalad lamina and the inferior articular process are resected until the superior articular process is identified. The superior articular process is then thinned out with use of a diamond burr and resected carefully with use of a Kerrison punch, allowing visualization of the nerve beneath. Decompression should be wide, carried out from pedicle to pedicle and as laterally as required. A discectomy may be performed at this stage.<h4>Alternatives</h4>Alternatives include open posterior cervical foraminotomy, ACDF, and cervical disc arthroplasty.<h4>Rationale</h4>In the case of isolated cervical radiculopathy, the pathology is limited to the foramen. The foramen may be approached either anteriorly or posteriorly. However, in order to successfully address the foramen anteriorly, a complete discectomy should be performed. In such cases, either a fusion or disc arthroplasty should be performed concurrently with the discectomy. Both fusion and disc arthroplasty are associated with complications such as adjacent segment degeneration, implant subsidence, infection, nonunion, and others<sup>4</sup>. Posterior foraminotomy allows for successful neural decompression posteriorly, but when performed in an open fashion it requires substantial soft-tissue dissection for an appropriate exposure, which may result in notable postoperative neck pain. Posterior endoscopic cervical foraminotomy addresses many of these shortcomings because it allows for successful neural decompression through an endoscope, with minimal soft-tissue dissection; maintains range of motion; and preserves most of the disc at that level<sup>4</sup>. Furthermore, this technique does not preclude or complicate the ability to perform a full discectomy anteriorly in the future, if needed.<h4>Expected outcomes</h4>Endoscopic posterior cervical foraminotomy has been shown to have excellent clinical outcomes; however, as with any spinal surgery, it carries a risk of complications. Kim et al. compared outcomes between uniportal endoscopic cervical foraminotomy, biportal endoscopic cervical foraminotomy, and tubular cervical foraminotomy. All 3 techniques demonstrated similar outcomes at 1 month in terms of pain improvement; however, length of hospital stay and overall complication rates were lowest in the uniportal endoscopy group<sup>5</sup>. In a recent meta-analysis, Guo et al. compared endoscopic cervical foraminotomy and ACDF for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy. Postoperative pain, symptom resolution, and complication rates were similar between procedures. The most common complications were cage subsidence and dysphagia for ACDF compared with nerve root palsy for endoscopic foraminotomy<sup>6</sup>.<h4>Important tips</h4>Dropping your hands medially allows for undercutting of the inferior articular process, maximizing foraminal expansion while preserving as much facet joint as possible. At least 50% of the facet joint should be maintained in order to avoid iatrogenic instability.To improve hemostasis, transiently increase fluid pressure by obstructing fluid outflow or advancing the endoscope. Pump pressure settings can also be temporarily increased if needed; however, care must be taken not to compromise intrathecal circulation or elevate intracranial pressure.Pulling disc fragments straight out frequently results in fragmentation. Instead, we recommend maintaining a gentle grasp and utilizing a twisting motion to extract disc herniations in the case of larger fragments.Understand the learning curve for performing posterior endoscopic cervical foraminotomy and plan accordingly for case duration<sup>6</sup>.<h4>Acronyms and abbreviations</h4>PECF = posterior endoscopic cervical foraminotomyLOS = length of stayIAP = inferior articular processSAP = superior articular processNSAID = nonsteroidal anti-Inflammatory drugMRI = magnetic resonance imagingOR = operating roomAP = anteroposteriorVAS = visual analog scaleUPE = uniportal endoscopyBP = biportal endoscopy.",Raad M; Derman P,"Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.",JBJS essential surgical techniques,2025-06-25,10.2106/jbjs.st.24.00003,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40562768,Food contact articles as source of micro- and nanoplastics: a systematic evidence map.,"Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) in foodstuffs lead to widespread human exposure and are often linked to environmental contamination. However, the role of plastics in food contact articles (FCAs) has received less attention, despite being a known source. Thus, we compiled a systematic evidence map of MNPs present in foodstuffs in contact with all types of plastic FCAs. We extracted data on experimental design, FCAs, MNPs, and food or food simulants and critically appraised the general data quality, material identification methods, polymer type reporting, and study design. We included 103 eligible studies and created 600 database entries accessible in an interactive dashboard. Seven studies were appraised as highly reliable. We conclude that the normal/intended use of FCAs can lead to the migration of MNPs. Further research is needed to systematically characterize MNP migration related to materials and use. To better protect human health, regulations could mandate MNP migration testing for FCAs.",Zimmermann L; Geueke B; Parkinson LV; Schür C; Wagner M; Muncke J,"Food Packaging Forum Foundation, Zürich, Switzerland. lisa.zimmermann@fp-forum.org.",NPJ science of food,2025-06-25,10.1038/s41538-025-00470-3,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
40555447,Using qualitative research and the person-based approach to coproduce an inclusive intervention for postpartum blood pressure self-management.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To coproduce an inclusive intervention for blood pressure (BP) self-management post partum.<h4>Design</h4>Using the person-based approach, an intervention was coproduced in three phases. Phase 1 entailed intervention coproduction with a diverse patient and public involvement panel and stakeholders (clinical, academic, government and third sector-based). Phase 2 involved intervention optimisation through think-aloud interviews with former patients and clinicians. Phase 3 was user-testing followed by semistructured interviews with current patients and their clinicians.<h4>Setting</h4>Patients and clinicians from primary and secondary care drawn from Southern and Northern England.<h4>Participants</h4>Seven former patients and 11 clinicians participated in think-aloud interviews to provide their views of intervention prototypes (phase 2). Additionally, 23 patients and 9 of their clinicians participated in semistructured interviews after using the intervention for 2 weeks (phase 3).<h4>Intervention</h4>An interactive patient app-My BP Care-and accompanying leaflet to support BP self-monitoring. These were linked to a clinician dashboard with alerts and an emailing system to facilitate appropriate titration of patient medication.<h4>Results</h4>The intervention was codeveloped following these guiding principles to ensure it was accessible and inclusive: easily comprehensible, motivating, simple and quick to use. Interview findings indicated that patient adherence to the intervention was promoted by the initial patient training conducted by the midwives, the enhanced clinical oversight they felt they received as a result of the intervention, the free BP monitor they received, reassurance they received of the medication safety for them and their baby, the intervention's simplicity and the motivating reminders they received.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through coproduction with a diverse group of patients and stakeholders, and optimisation through testing among further diverse patients and clinicians, we developed a multicomponent intervention that is accessible and engaging for diverse patients, compatible with prevailing clinical practice and adaptable to different clinical contexts.",Ochieng CA; Burke C; Green M; Igwe S; Tucker KL; Hinton L; Goddard L; Roman C; McManus RJ; Yardley L,"School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK c.ochieng@bristol.ac.uk.",BMJ open,2025-06-24,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-098162,1.5,dashboard(abstract),Behavior; Postpartum Women; Telemedicine; Qualitative Research; Patient Participation; Self-management
