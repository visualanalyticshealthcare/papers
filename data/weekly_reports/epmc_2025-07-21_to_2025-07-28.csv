40696033,Research on the design of smartwatch health information visualization presentation under different motion scenarios.,"Investigating how to adapt smartwatches to meet the distinct needs of users across various motion scenarios, while optimizing visual presentation design to enhance user experience, is an area that deserves thorough exploration. Three experiments were conducted to assess the impact of form, animation, and color on visual presentation. A total of 45 participants took part in each experiment and were divided into three groups. Experiment 1 examined the effect of presentation form using a two-factor mixed design: 2 (presentation form: text, charts, graphs) × 3 (motion scenarios: static, Low-intensity movement, High-intensity movement). Experiment 2 focused on the influence of presentation animation with a two-factor mixed design: 3 (presentation animation: no animation, gradual appearance, geometric morphing) × 3 (motion scenarios: static, Low-intensity movement, High-intensity movement). Experiment 3 investigated the impact of color mode using a two-factor mixed design: 2 (color mode: dark mode, light mode) × 3 (motion scenarios: static, Low-intensity movement, High-intensity movement). Presentation form significantly impacted both cognitive performance and subjective perception, with text being outperformed by charts and graphs. Presentation animation had a notable effect on cognitive performance, with non-animated presentations yielding higher performance scores compared to animations. However, in terms of subjective perception, animated presentations were preferred over non-animated ones. Finally, color mode significantly influenced subjective perception, with dark mode receiving more favorable ratings than light mode. Charts and graphs as a presentation form outperform text in both efficiency and user preference. In terms of information acquisition, non-animated presentations are more efficient than animated ones, although animations score higher in user preference. Additionally, dark mode is more positively evaluated by users compared to light mode.",Jin W; Deng W,"College of Furnishings and Industrial Design, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.",Scientific reports,2025-07-22,10.1038/s41598-025-12226-w,10.0,"visualization(kw,title); visual(kw,title,abstract)",Sports Health; Color Mode; Presentation Animation; Smartwatch Interface Design; Visualization Presentation
40694226,Research Progress in Artificial Intelligence for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy: A Systematic Review.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>This review synthesizes advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) applications for central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), analyzing challenges and outlining future research directions to guide personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search was conducted in the Web of Science database using a comprehensive AI-related keyword set (e.g., ""deep learning,"" ""neural networks,"" ""computer vision"") combined with ""central serous chorioretinopathy."" The search yielded 698 records, with 73 original research studies selected after excluding reviews and non-empirical work based on predefined criteria.<h4>Results</h4>The application of AI in CSCR has progressed from disease classification to dynamic prognostic prediction, leveraging multimodal data fusion (e.g., optical coherence tomography [OCT] and OCT angiography [OCTA] and fundus fluorescein angiography [FFA]) to enhance both qualitative and quantitative diagnostic accuracy. AI models outperform clinical experts in classifying retinal disease subtypes and segmenting lesions. However, clinical translation faces infrastructural barriers (e.g., incompatible PACS systems) and limited physician trust due to ""black box"" decision-making. New approaches, such as explainable AI (XAI), are being integrated to enhance the transparency and clinical applicability of AI models. Key limitations involve single-center data dependency, interobserver annotation variability, and the inability of static frameworks to capture dynamic lesion progression.<h4>Conclusion</h4>AI enhances CSCR diagnosis and subtyping efficiency. To optimize clinical translation, future research should focus on multicenter data integration, dynamic visualization frameworks, and standardized guidelines, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and prospective trials for personalized treatment strategies. Incorporating federated learning for privacy-preserving data sharing and prioritizing explainability will be essential to overcoming barriers to physician adoption and improving trust in AI-driven clinical decision-making. Future efforts should focus on creating dynamic systems that provide real-time insights into lesion progression and integrating them with standardized protocols for wider clinical adoption.",Zhang P; Zhang Q; Hu X; Chi W; Yang W,"The Second Clinical Medical College of Jinan University, Shenzhen, 518020, Guangdong, China.",Ophthalmology and therapy,2025-07-22,10.1007/s40123-025-01209-9,9.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,title,abstract); machine learning(kw); data(abstract)",Optical Coherence Tomography (Oct); Machine Learning (Ml); Artificial Intelligence (Ai); Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (Cscr); Deep Learning (Dl); Color Fundus Photography (Cfp)

40702787,Anatomically Based Multitask Deep Learning Radiomics Nomogram Predicts the Implant Failure Risk in Sinus Floor Elevation.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To develop and assess the performance of an anatomically based multitask deep learning radiomics nomogram (AMDRN) system to predict implant failure risk before maxillary sinus floor elevation (MSFE) while incorporating automated segmentation of key anatomical structures.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We retrospectively collected patients' preoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images and electronic medical records (EMRs). First, the nn-UNet v2 model was optimized to segment the maxillary sinus (MS), Schneiderian membrane (SM), and residual alveolar bone (RAB). Based on the segmentation mask, a deep learning model (3D-Attention-ResNet) and a radiomics model were developed to extract 3D features from CBCT scans, generating the DL Score, and Rad Score. Significant clinical features were also extracted from EMRs to build a clinical model. These components were then integrated using logistic regression (LR) to create the AMDRN model, which includes a visualization module to support clinical decision-making.<h4>Results</h4>Segmentation results for MS, RAB, and SM achieved high DICE coefficients on the test set, with values of 99.50% ± 0.84%, 92.53% ± 3.78%, and 91.58% ± 7.16%, respectively. On an independent test set, the Clinical model, Radiomics model, 3D-DL model, and AMDRN model achieved prediction accuracies of 60%, 76%, 82%, and 90%, respectively, with AMDRN achieving the highest AUC of 93%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The AMDRN system enables efficient preoperative prediction of implant failure risk in MSFE and accurate segmentation of critical anatomical structures, supporting personalized treatment planning and clinical risk management.",Zhu Y; Liu Y; Zhao Y; Lu Q; Wang W; Chen Y; Ji P; Chen T,"Stomatological Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.",Clinical oral implants research,2025-07-23,10.1111/clr.70011,4.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw),Artificial intelligence; Early diagnosis; Dental Implant; Sinus Floor Augmentation; Deep Learning; Cone‐beam Computed Tomography
40705572,Hierarchical Temporal Attention Networks for Cancer Registry Abstraction: Leveraging Longitudinal Clinical Data with Interpretability.,"Cancer registration is a vital source of information for government-driven cancer prevention and control policies. However, cancer registry abstraction is a complex and labor-intensive process, requiring the extraction of structured data from large volumes of unstructured clinical reports. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical temporal attention network leveraging attention mechanisms at the word, sentence, and document levels, while incorporating temporal and report type information to capture nuanced relationships within patients' longitudinal data. To ensure robust evaluation, a stratified sampling algorithm was developed to balance the training, validation, and test datasets across 23 coding tasks, mitigating potential biases. The proposed method achieved an average F1-score of 0.82, outperforming existing approaches by prioritizing task-relevant words, sentences, and reports through its attention mechanism. An ablation study confirmed the critical contributions of the proposed components. Furthermore, a prototype visualization tool was developed to present interpretability, providing cancer registrars with insights into the decision-making process by visualizing attention at multiple levels of granularity. Overall, the proposed methods combined with the interpretabilityfocused visualization tool, represent a significant step toward automating cancer registry abstraction from unstructured clinical text in longitudinal settings.",Dai HJ; Wu HH,,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2025-07-24,10.1109/jbhi.2025.3592444,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
40698679,Integrative Profiling of the Ovarian Reserve Using Ultrasound and MRI Data by Comparative Analysis: A Systematic Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Ovarian reserve reflects the functional capacity of a woman's ovaries, encompassing factors such as follicle quantity, egg quality, and fertilization potential. Assessment of ovarian reserve is essential in reproductive medicine, particularly for fertility evaluation and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). While traditional biochemical markers such as anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are commonly used, instrumental diagnostic methods like ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide valuable morphological and functional insights. This systematic review without a comprehensive meta-analysis evaluates the role of ultrasound and MRI in assessing ovarian reserve and their potential applications in clinical and research settings.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases to identify relevant studies evaluating ovarian reserve using ultrasound and MRI. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion criteria, focusing on imaging parameters such as ovarian volume, follicular count, stromal characteristics, and vascularization. The effectiveness of these imaging techniques was analyzed in comparison to established biochemical markers. Due to heterogeneity in the included studies, a systematic review was performed without a formal meta-analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Ultrasound, particularly transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), remains the gold standard for ovarian reserve assessment, allowing real-time visualization of antral follicle count (AFC), ovarian volume, and follicular morphology. Doppler ultrasound provides additional insights into ovarian blood flow, which correlates with follicular development and ovarian function. MRI offers high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging, enabling detailed assessment of ovarian structure, follicular density, and stromal composition. While MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast, its role in routine ovarian reserve assessment is limited due to cost and accessibility. The findings indicate that although both modalities are valuable for ovarian reserve evaluation, there is no consensus on standardized imaging parameters for defining ovarian functional viability. The available literature also presents inconsistencies in the correlation between imaging findings and ovarian function.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ultrasound and MRI are essential tools for assessing ovarian reserve, providing complementary morphological and functional data. However, the lack of standardized imaging parameters limits their ability to definitively determine ovarian functional viability. Further research is needed to establish validated diagnostic criteria and integrate imaging techniques with biochemical markers to enhance the accuracy of ovarian reserve assessment in clinical practice and reproductive research.",A KV; Beeraka NM; V MA; S MA; M GM; Yu VY; Yu BD; Chagalamari A; Y PR; Basappa B; Nikolenko VN,"Department of Human Anatomy and Histology, FSAEI HE I.

40706496,Automatic porcine diarrhea viruses classification using pathological images and hybrid semantic neural network.,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea is a highly contagious intestinal disease in pigs, caused by various strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The infection rate in suckling piglets can reach 100%. Manual analysis of pathological images is the primary method for distinguishing PEDV types. However, the diversity and complexity of PEDV lead to low efficiency and accuracy of detection. To address this issue, we propose a novel pathological image-based amplitude and phase hybrid semantic neural network (APHNet). APHNet introduces amplitude and phase concepts from quantum mechanical wave functions to represent the original features of the images and the semantic variations, respectively. It extracts distinct semantic information from tokens in images, while ensuring characteristic weight aggregation. We validated APHNet on a constructed piglet diarrhea database and demonstrated high performance, with an accuracy of 85.56%, recall of 85.07%, F1-score of 0.86, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 89.02%. These experimental results demonstrate that APHNet is effective for PEDV classification. Furthermore, visualization and expert comparison methods were used to analyze differences in the pathological phenotypes of various viruses. The results of this study provide valuable insights for improving animal health and automated production monitoring.",Liu L; Xie J; Zhao F; Chang J; Yang Y; Guo ZT; Zhang L,"Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, 460045, Henan, PR China.

40705571,MRLF-DDI: A Multi-view Representation Learning Framework for Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction.,"Accurately predicting drug-drug interaction events (DDIEs) is critical for improving medication safety and guiding clinical decision-making. However, existing graph neural network (GNN)-based methods often struggle to effectively integrate multi-view features and generalize to novel or understudied drugs. To address these limitations, we propose MRLF-DDI, a multi-view representation learning framework that jointly models information from individual drug features, local interaction contexts, and global interaction patterns. MRLF-DDI introduces the use of atomlevel structural features enriched with bond angle information-marking the first incorporation of this geometryaware feature in DDIE prediction. It further employs a multigranularity GNN and a gated knowledge transfer strategy to enhance feature learning and cold-start generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MRLF-DDI achieves superior performance in both warm-start and cold-start scenarios. Case studies and visualization analyses further highlight its practical utility in identifying clinically relevant DDIEs.

40693719,Continuous Monitoring of Bladder Dysfunction in People With Multiple Sclerosis: Wearables for the Bladder.,"<h4>Background</h4>Bladder dysfunction affects over 85% of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), yet current assessment methods are limited to periodic in-clinic evaluations or subjective patient reports, failing to capture real-world symptom fluctuations.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the feasibility and validity of using a novel remote bladder ultrasound device for home monitoring of bladder dysfunction in PwMS, comparing remote measurements with standard clinical assessments.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-two women with MS participated in this 3-month pilot study. Participants were asked to use the wearable ultrasound device at home for at least 3-5 days a month. Remote device measurements were compared with standard clinical data for post-void residual (rPVR vs. cPVR) and urinary frequency (rFrequency vs. 3-day bladder diary frequency). Agreement between measures was assessed using Bland-Altman analyses and correlation coefficients.<h4>Results</h4>Participants were middle-aged (mean 51.5 years; SD 9.3) with mild-moderate disability (median EDSS 4.0) and mostly relapsing MS (72.7%). Study retention was high (86.4%; 19/22), with mean device utilization of 14.1 days. Good agreement was seen between rPVR and cPVR (mean difference = 32.1 mL, SD = 38.6; 95% limits of agreement: -43.6, 107.9). The rFrequency measure also demonstrated a strong correlation with patient-reported frequency (ICC = 0.81, Pearson's r = 0.793, p = 0.002). Visualization of remote monitoring data revealed substantial day-to-day variability in bladder symptoms not captured by traditional assessments.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and preliminary validity of using wearable ultrasound technology for remote monitoring of bladder dysfunction in PwMS.

40701370,Opioids prescribed by pharmacist under the Health Canada's Controlled Drugs and Substances Act temporary exemption.,"<h4>Background</h4>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Health Canada issued a temporary exemption for the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). Very little is known about pharmacists prescribing opioids under the CDSA temporary exemption.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the impact of CDSA subsection 56(1) temporary exemption on prescribing of opioids by direct patient care pharmacists during COVID-19 between February 1, 2018 to April 30, 2022.<h4>Methods</h4>Descriptive statistics (sample mean, sample standard deviation, sample proportion) and data visualization tools were used to explore the possible changes due to CDSA. In the first stage, a linear regression model was fit to the data to detect the changes. Second, time dependence of the data was checked by examining the autocorrelation plots and testing dependence of the residuals, and then a suitable time series process was used.<h4>Results</h4>The mean overall pharmacist-prescribed opioid weekly claims increased from 0.0 (per-CDSA policy period) to 57.0 (post-CDSA policy period). The time series regression for the mean level change for the overall prescription data was 36.29, 95% CI 27.14, 48.52, p <0.0001. The time series regression for the mean level change for the analgesic prescription data and the opioid use disorder prescription data was 28.95, 95% CI 20.88, 40.13, p <0.0001 and 6.74, 95% CI 5.80, 7.82, p <0.0001.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The temporary exemption under the CDSA during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed pharmacists in Nova Scotia to prescribe opioids, ensuring continuity of opioid therapy for adults.

40691813,"Comparison of short-term clinical outcomes and muscle injury in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis undergoing arthroscopic-assisted uni-portal spinal surgery, unilateral biportal endoscopic surgery, and percutaneous interlaminar lumbar discectomy: a six-month follow-up.","<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to assess and compare the six-month postoperative clinical outcomes of Arthroscopic-assisted Uni-portal Spinal Surgery (AUSS), unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE), and percutaneous interlaminar endoscopic discectomy (PEID) for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Additionally, muscle injury associated with these procedures is evaluated by analyzing changes in creatine kinase (CK) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 288 patients diagnosed with single-segment unilateral LSS and treated between January 2021 and June 2024 were included in this study. Patients were assigned to the AUSS group (n = 129), UBE group (n = 86), or PEID group (n = 73). Surgical parameters, including operative time, incision length, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative facet joint preservation rate, were recorded. Clinical outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at 3 days, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EQ-5D-5 L quality of life index, and the modified Macnab criteria. The extent of muscle injury was quantified through serum CK and CRP levels measured preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Descriptive statistics and multiple comparison analyses were used to assess clinical parameters among the three groups. Longitudinal data were analyzed using a generalized mixed linear model.<h4>Results</h4>The AUSS group demonstrated significantly shorter operative times and smaller incision lengths compared to the UBE and PEID groups (P < 0.001). Postoperative VAS scores decreased significantly in all three groups, with the greatest improvement observed in the AUSS group (P < 0.05). ODI and EQ-5D-5 L scores indicated superior postoperative quality of life in the AUSS group compared to the UBE and PEID groups (P < 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were observed in the modified Macnab criteria outcomes or postoperative complication rates among the three groups (P > 0.05). The PEID group exhibited the lowest postoperative CK and CRP levels as well as the least intraoperative blood loss (P < 0.05), suggesting minimal muscle injury. The AUSS group showed lower muscle injury levels than the UBE group (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Arthroscopic-assisted Uni-portal Spinal Surgery (AUSS), unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) technique, and percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID) are all effective minimally invasive approaches for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). AUSS offers shorter operative time and better preservation of anatomical structures. PEID minimizes intraoperative tissue damage and reduces inflammatory response, while UBE balances visualization with operational flexibility. All three techniques demonstrate good short-term clinical outcomes. The surgical approach should be tailored to each patient's symptoms and individualized needs. Although AUSS demonstrated certain intraoperative advantages, this study did not show that AUSS is superior to UBE or PEID in clinical efficacy or complication control. As a novel technique, AUSS may improve postoperative pain and quality of life, providing a valuable addition to the minimally invasive treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis.",Zhou S; Xu X; Guo T; Sun J; A J,"Graduate School of Qinghai University, Xining City, Qinghai Province, 810000, China.",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,2025-07-21,10.1186/s13018-025-06088-1,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Lumbar spinal stenosis; Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy; Arthroscopic-assisted Uni-portal Spinal Surgery; Percutaneous Interlaminar Endoscopic Discectomy

40569078,Multifunctional metal-organic frameworks and their heterojunction materials for cancer theranostics.,"Malignant tumours continue to present a significant challenge to global public health, with early theranostics serving as critical strategies to enhance patient prognosis. Advancements in nanotechnology have catalyzed the development of innovative approaches, where the synergy between nanomaterials and therapeutic modalities offers promising solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional cancer treatments. Among these innovations, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a focal point of research in cancer theranostics. Their three-dimensional porous structure, precisely tunable pore sizes, excellent biocompatibility, and versatile surface functionalization make them particularly attractive. Additionally, the controllable synthesis and ordered structural characteristics of MOFs enable the integration of functional nanoparticles through hierarchical assembly strategies, resulting in heterojunction systems with various configurations, such as ""core-shell"", ""moon-star"", ""yolk-shell"", and ""Janus"" structures. These materials demonstrate synergistic effects in cancer treatment, often outperforming single MOF materials. This review comprehensively discusses the latest advancements in single and double metal MOFs, as well as their heterojunction-derived materials, in tumour visualization, targeted therapy, and integrated theranostics. The insights provided offer important theoretical foundations and technical references for the clinical translation of MOF-based nanomedicines.",Wang W; Huang Y; Li Y; Geng P; Lan H; Luo D; Xiao S,"Key Laboratory of Inorganic Nonmetallic Crystalline and Energy Conversion Materials, College of Materials and Chemical Engineering, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, Hubei, China. gengpeng@ctgu.edu.cn.",Biomaterials science,2025-07-22,10.1039/d5bm00544b,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40625260,Surface-engineered nanoprobes for multimodal bioimaging: from molecular design to theranostic integration.,"Bioimaging technologies are indispensable for deciphering cellular dynamics, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic responses. However, conventional agents are limited by photobleaching, poor tissue penetration, and nonspecific distribution. These shortcomings hinder real-time visualization of deep tissues and complex pathologies. Surface-engineered nanoprobes have revolutionized bioimaging and theranostics by addressing these limitations. This review systematically explores the molecular design principles and biomedical applications of these advanced nanoprobes. We highlight several major surface engineering strategies (ligand-mediated targeting, environmental responsiveness, charge engineering, surface coating and core-shell structure) and their applications to high-resolution, dynamic and real-time, multimodal imaging. Finally, we outline future perspectives for surface-engineered nanoprobes, emphasizing critical challenges in clinical translation.

40685960,Collagen-Anchoring Polymer Dots Enable Rapid and Precise Detection of Microlesions in Inflammatory Bowel Disease through Perivascular Matrix Accumulation.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) poses substantial challenges in early diagnosis and the detection of small lesions due to clinical heterogeneity and limitations of existing imaging techniques. In this study, functional polymer dots (Pdots) are developed to rapidly and precisely image microlesions by extravasating from IBD-associated vasculature and anchoring within the perivascular matrix mediated by collagen. These Pdots are engineered with dual-channel fluorescence (visible/NIR windows) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging capabilities, making them suitable for non-invasive IBD diagnosis. Diagnosis using these functional Pdots can be completed within 3 h, which is significantly faster than current nanoprobes. Furthermore, the Pdots allow for continuous visualization of the IBD-affected areas for up to 24 h. They are capable of detecting microlesions smaller than 200 µm, surpassing the resolution achieved in previous studies. Additionally, even when utilizing wide-field stereoscopic fluorescence microscopy, the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) in IBD-affected areas reaches up to 4.75. High-resolution microvascular imaging reveals IBD-associated intestinal vascular remodeling, including mucosal vascular dilation and submucosal pathological angiogenesis at a resolution of 2-3 µm. Notably, IBD induces a marked increase in the proportion of microvessels with diameters less than 20 µm in the cecum, Peyer's patches (PP), and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of mice. This work establishes functional Pdots as promising nanoplatforms for rapid and precise IBD diagnosis by leveraging the pathological features of IBD-affected areas. Moreover, they facilitate real-time and high-resolution visualization of microvasculature, offering significant potential for guiding therapeutic interventions.",Lu S; Li Y; Zhang Z; Teng M; Hou J; Tan X; Lu Q; Xiong L,"Shanghai Med-X Engineering Center for Medical Equipment and Technology, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200030, China.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025-07-21,10.1002/adhm.202501580,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Microlesion; Polymer Dots; Collagen‐anchoring; Perivascular Matrix Accumulation
40691513,Advances in IPMN imaging: deep learning-enhanced HASTE improves lesion assessment.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The prevalence of asymptomatic pancreatic cysts is increasing due to advances in imaging techniques. Among these, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are most common, with potential for malignant transformation, often necessitating close follow-up. This study evaluates novel MRI techniques for the assessment of IPMN.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>From May to December 2023, 59 patients undergoing abdominal MRI were retrospectively enrolled. Examinations were conducted on 3-Tesla scanners using a Deep-Learning Accelerated Half-Fourier Single-Shot Turbo Spin-Echo (HASTE<sub>DL</sub>) and standard HASTE (HASTE<sub>S</sub>) sequence. Two readers assessed minimum detectable lesion size and lesion-to-parenchyma contrast quantitatively, and qualitative assessments focused on image quality. Statistical analyses included the Wilcoxon signed-rank and chi-squared tests.<h4>Results</h4>HASTE<sub>DL</sub> demonstrated superior overall image quality (p < 0.001), with higher sharpness and contrast ratings (p < 0.001, p = 0.112). HASTE<sub>DL</sub> showed enhanced conspicuity of IPMN (p < 0.001) and lymph nodes (p < 0.001), with more frequent visualization of IPMN communication with the pancreatic duct (p < 0.001). Visualization of complex features (dilated pancreatic duct, septa, and mural nodules) was superior in HASTE<sub>DL</sub> (p < 0.001). The minimum detectable cyst size was significantly smaller for HASTE<sub>DL</sub> (4.17 mm ± 3.00 vs. 5.51 mm ± 4.75; p < 0.001). Inter-reader agreement was for (к 0.936) for HASTE<sub>DL</sub>, slightly lower (к 0.885) for HASTE<sub>S</sub>.<h4>Conclusion</h4>HASTE<sub>DL</sub> in IPMN imaging provides superior image quality and significantly reduced scan times. Given the increasing prevalence of IPMN and the ensuing clinical need for fast and precise imaging, HASTE<sub>DL</sub> improves the availability and quality of patient care.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Are there advantages of deep-learning-accelerated MRI in imaging and assessing intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)? Findings Deep-Learning Accelerated Half-Fourier Single-Shot Turbo Spin-Echo (HASTE<sub>DL</sub>) demonstrated superior image quality, improved conspicuity of ""worrisome features"" and detection of smaller cysts, with significantly reduced scan times.

40697460,"Red-emitting fluorescent probes based on sulfur-substituted barbituric acid derivatives: synthesis, properties and biomedical applications.","Fluorescence bioimaging has emerged as a vital tool for tracking dynamic biochemical processes and monitoring disease biomarkers <i>in vivo</i>. This technique has demonstrated significant clinical and commercial potential in fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) for tumor treatment, attributed to its real-time visualization capabilities and high biocompatibility. To achieve precise delineation of tumor boundaries and complete tumor resection, the rational design and selection of contrast agents are critical. Herein, we report a novel red-emitting fluorophore, TTS, based on thiobarbituric acid (TBA) derivatives and tetraphenylethylene. The design strategy, synthetic route, optical properties, and cytotoxicity of TTS are systematically described. Benefiting from its highly twisted molecular conformation and enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect, TTS exhibits superior aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics with emission wavelengths extending into the NIR-I region (700-900 nm), as well as a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating capability. Systematic <i>in vivo</i> evaluations further demonstrate that TTS nanoparticles (NPs), which were formulated with DSPE-PEG2000 encapsulation, can accurately illuminate osteosarcoma tissues and effectively guide surgical resection through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.

40694121,An easy alternative technique for percutaneous nephrolithotomy with laparoscopic trocar and ultrasound guiding: safety and effectiveness in rural area setting.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is an effective treatment for large kidney stones, but wider access paths increase the risk of bleeding. While modern miniaturized PCNL techniques reduce invasiveness, they can compromise stone fragment clearance. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel PCNL technique utilizing pediatric trocar laparoscopy to enhance visualization and potentially minimize blood loss.<h4>Methods</h4>A single-centered prospective study was conducted at Sultan Agung Islamic Hospital, Semarang, Indonesia, between July and September 2024. Patients with large kidney stones underwent a novel technique replacing PCNL after obtaining informed consent. The primary endpoints measured were stone-free rate and major complications after the procedure.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-four participants were enrolled in this study, with 41 completing it. The 24-hour stone-free rate was 87.8%, improving to 100% at 30 days. The mean operative time was 42 ± 13.6 min, with an average hospital stay of 2.39 ± 0.81 days. No major complications were reported. The mean hemoglobin drop was minimal, and transient postoperative leukocytosis without clinical infection was observed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study suggests that a novel technique for treating large kidney stones using a 3.5 mm laparoscopic trocar in PCNL is considered an effective and safe procedure as an alternative to the standard PCNL procedure.",Lubis AS; Wajiih WC; Al Kautsar A; Nugraha MA; Jhorghi S; Makarim FR; Wijaya FS,"Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Islam Sultan Agung, Kompleks Amaya Blok A3 19, Kelurahan Sidomulyo, Kecamatan Ungaran Timur, Kabupaten Semarang, Semarang, Jawa Tengah, Indonesia. sulaimanlubis@unissula.ac.id.",World journal of urology,2025-07-22,10.1007/s00345-025-05837-5,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Techniques; Urolithiasis; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy; staghorn calculus
40690661,Digital Infrared Thermographic Imaging for Limb Salvage in Patients at Risk of Amputation: Prospective Observational Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Scores and prediction models such as the mangled extremity severity score (MESS) for trauma and the Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classification for diabetic foot ulcers help in the decision-making process for amputation. However, these tools can be subjective as they depend on the experience of the medical staff applying them.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to assess the impact of temperature measurement using infrared thermal imaging in extremity salvage in patients at risk of limb amputation.<h4>Methods</h4>We included 29 patients who sought a second opinion after an amputation recommendation. Infrared thermographic images were acquired to measure the temperature difference (ΔT) between the injured and uninjured limbs. For patients with salvaged limbs, we provided clinical follow-up for up to 12 weeks.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 29 patients enrolled in the study, 27 limbs were salvaged. Thermographic imaging allowed the distinction into two groups: the first group of 18 patients with mean ΔT value of -3.6 °C (SD 1.99 °C) , and the second group of 9 patients with mean ΔT of 3.36 °C (SD 2.71 °C). None of the patients in either group showed progression in ΔT values within the first 5 days; at the twelfth week, ΔT values approached 0 °C at wound closure. Of the two patients who required amputation, one showed an initial ΔT of -4.3 °C, which worsened to -5 °C by the fifth day, and the other patient showed an initial ΔT of -4.5 °C, which worsened to -5.8 °C by the fifth day.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Digital infrared thermography is a tool that may help guide limb salvage in patients with uncertain clinical diagnoses.

40694500,Modular DNA barcoding of nanobodies enables multiplexed in situ protein imaging and high-throughput biomolecule detection.,"Current immunodetection methods using antibody-DNA conjugates enable multiplexed target detection through orthogonal DNA barcodes, but existing conjugation approaches are labor-intensive and often compromise antibody function. Here, we present a modular, site-specific, and cost-efficient DNA tagging strategy - multiplexed and modular barcoding of antibodies (MaMBA). Utilizing nanobodies as modular adaptors, MaMBA enables direct site-specific labeling of off-the-shelf IgG antibodies with a one-component design. We first applied MaMBA to develop the MaMBA-assisted immunosignal hybridization chain reaction (<i>mis</i>HCR) method for highly multiplexed in situ protein imaging via orthogonal HCR. Its cleavable variant, <i>mis</i>HCR<sup>n</sup>, achieves simultaneous visualization of 12 different targets within the same mouse brain sections through iterative probe use. We further extended the cleavable MaMBA to develop the barcode-linked immunosorbent assay (BLISA) for multiplexed and high-throughput biomolecule detections. By combining BLISA with next-generation sequencing, we successfully measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated antigens in a large number of human serum samples. Additionally, we demonstrated a small-scale drug screen by using BLISA to simultaneously detect eight protein targets. In conclusion, MaMBA offers a highly modular and easily adaptable approach for antibody DNA barcoding, which can be broadly applied in basic research and clinical diagnostics.",Zhong S; Wang R; Gao X; Guo Q; Lin R; Luo M,"School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.",eLife,2025-07-22,10.7554/elife.105225,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Human; Biochemistry; Immunoassay; Mouse; Neuroscience; Immunostaining; DNA Barcoding; Nanobody; Chemical Biology; Hcr; Multiplexed Detection
40693784,Novel Intradural Endoscopic Lumbosacral Ventral-Dorsal Rhizotomy: A Technical Note With Operative Video.,"<h4>Background and importance</h4>Movement disorders in children, particularly medically refractory hypertonia caused by cerebral palsy, often require surgical intervention. Lumbosacral ventral-dorsal rhizotomy (VDR), which includes sectioning both ventral and dorsal nerve roots, is a viable treatment for dyskinesias like dystonia. However, severe scoliotic spinal rotation can make traditional open rhizotomy and other minimal access approaches technically impractical. We report the first endoscopic VDR, offering a minimal access and non-destabilizing alternative for patients with severe spinal rotation.<h4>Clinical presentation</h4>We present a 21-year-old nonambulatory male with spastic, dystonic cerebral palsy, neuromuscular rotatory kyphoscoliosis, and spinal fusion who was nonrespondent to intrathecal baclofen bolus test dose of 100 μg. Severe spinal rotation and a large fusion mass made open and radiofrequency ablation approaches infeasible; we performed a 233-minute endoscopic VDR using flexible neuroendoscopy, mechanical nerve stimulation with free running electromyography, fluoroscopy, and bugbee electrocautery. Lessons learned include visualization, root selection, and extent of ablation. Postoperative modified Ashworth Scale was reduced to 0 in all muscle groups, and physical examination video shows improved sitting position with neutral spinal alignment and enhanced sitting balance.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This first-ever endoscopic VDR demonstrates a safe and effective tone reduction methodology for patients without alternative surgical options. We are encouraged by these results and hope that this operative technique may be expanded through continued surgical innovation.",Richards DC; Prasad D; Trierweiler R; Rourke K; Berton E; Katholi B; Raskin JS,"Department of Neurosurgery, Rush University Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, USA.","Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2025-07-22,10.1227/ons.0000000000001717,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),cerebral palsy; Case Report; Spinal Endoscopy; Mixed Hypertonia; Combined Rhizotomy; Lower Limb Hypertonia; Palliative Rhizotomy
40694243,Development and evaluation of a &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-labeled olaparib analog for PARP imaging.,"<h4>Background</h4>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an important therapeutic target in cancer treatment, and dynamic assessment of its expression level is essential for achieving precision therapy. Although <sup>18</sup>F-labeled PARP-targeted radiotracers have demonstrated remarkable tumor-imaging capabilities in preclinical studies, their high lipophilicity leads to increased non-specific uptake in abdominal organs, which has severely hindered their clinical translation. Furthermore, while PET imaging provides superior resolution and sensitivity, its infrastructure and operational demands may limit widespread accessibility in certain regions. Therefore, the development of SPECT-based PARP radiotracers could offer a complementary approach, potentially expanding access to PARP imaging in a broader range of clinical settings. To provide a more affordable and accessible alternative to PET probes, hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-olaparib was radiolabeled with technetium-99m (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using the MDA-MB-453 breast cancer model.<h4>Results</h4>[<sup>99m</sup>Tc][Tc-HYNIC/EDDA]-olaparib exhibits a high radiochemical yield (> 90%), excellent radiochemical purity (> 90%), and good in vitro stability. The introduction of ethylenediamine-N, N'-diacetic acid (EDDA) and tricine facilitated the synthesis of <sup>99m</sup>Tc complex, and improved the hydrophilicity (logP = 0.63 ± 0.25) of the probe as well, resulting in reduced the accumulation of radiation in the abdomen. In vitro results indicated that [<sup>99m</sup>Tc][Tc-HYNIC/EDDA]-olaparib could target PRAP-1 in MDA-MB-453 cells. In vivo experiments, micro SPECT/CT imaging provided clear visualization of MDA-MB-453 tumors with significant tumor-to-background distinction, and accumulation of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc][Tc-HYNIC/EDDA]-olaparib was quantified at 3.45 ± 0.17%ID/g at 1 h post intravenous injection.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings suggest that [<sup>99m</sup>Tc][Tc-HYNIC/EDDA]-olaparib holds great promise as a novel radiotracer for PARP imaging.",Xu W; Yan J; Zhong X; Pan D; Wang X; Xu Y; Wang L; Chen C; Yang M,"School of Life Sciences and Health Engineering, Jiangnan University, Jiangsu, 214122, China.",EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry,2025-07-22,10.1186/s41181-025-00373-4,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),PARP; Cancer Diagnosis; 99Mtc; Olaparib; Spect Imaging
40695490,Feasibility and Accuracy of Pedicle Screws in the Feline Thoracolumbar Spine.,"To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of vertebral pedicle screws in cats using a custom 3D-printed drill guide and 3D-printed vertebral columns.To simulate the surgical procedure, six vertebral columns from adult cats were 3D-printed. The columns were printed with a radiolucent material (PLA enriched with calcium carbonate-PLA+). One 3D-printed guide was created for each vertebra (from T10 to L7). Each preplanned hole was drilled and filled with a graphite cylinder for better visualization of the tunnel. All the phantoms were CT-scanned after the drilling operation. Each hole was graded using a modified classification scheme (grades 0 to 3) and compared to the planned tunnel angle. We enrolled one 5-year-old female patient with spinal trauma requiring vertebral stabilization presented at our hospital.A total of 126 holes were drilled. The overall mean screw deviation angle was 0.61 degrees (SD = 0.72). In safety evaluation, 117 (93%) screws were contained in the pedicle (grade 0), 7 screws (5.5%) were outside the pedicle by less than 0.5 mm (grade 1), and 2 (1.5%) screws were between 0.5 and 1 mm outside the pedicle. In the thoracic segment, all the holes (48/48) were classified as a grade 0, while in the lumbar segment, with a total of 78 holes drilled, there were 69 holes classified as grade 0 (88%), 7 holes classified as grade 1 (8.9%), and 2 holes classified as grade 2 (2.5%). The feline patient had suffered a T12 complete oblique vertebral body fracture. A total of six 1.7 mm screws, 20 mm long, (Fix-In, INTRAUMA) were placed: three in T12 and three in T13.Overall, there was a mean deviation of the hole angle from the planned angle of 0.61 degrees. The overall safety was 91.2% (screws graded as 0). A statistically significant association between screw grades and vertebral segment was found (<i>p</i>-value 0.02) as all the thoracic vertebrae are grade 0, while grade 1 and grade 2 were found only in the lumbar segment. Using pedicle screws in cats' vertebrae may reduce surgical trauma, as it requires exposure of only the most dorsal portion of the vertebral lamina, avoiding the need to expose the costal attachments. Also, placing cement dorsally is easier and can incorporate screw heads bilaterally. We effectively and safely performed the surgical procedure in one clinical case. Based on our results, the use of pedicle screws, previously applied in canine patients, could also be extended to feline patients, provided that 3D-printed guides are used to ensure accurate placement.",Rigo M; Cinti F; Menchetti M; Ventura L; Pratesi A,"Clinica Veterinaria San Marco, Veggiano, Italy.",Veterinary and comparative orthopaedics and traumatology : V.C.O.T,2025-07-22,10.1055/a-2653-2592,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
