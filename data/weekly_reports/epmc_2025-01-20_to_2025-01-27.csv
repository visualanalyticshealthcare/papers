39842003,"The Significance of a Cerebrovascular Accident Outcome Prediction Model for Patients, Family Members, and Health Care Professionals: Qualitative Evaluation Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA) should be involved in setting their rehabilitation goals. A personalized prediction of CVA outcomes would allow care professionals to better inform patients and informal caregivers. Several accurate prediction models have been created, but acceptance and proper implementation of the models are prerequisites for model adoption.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to assess the added value of a prediction model for long-term outcomes of rehabilitation after CVA and evaluate how it can best be displayed, implemented, and integrated into the care process.<h4>Methods</h4>We designed a mock-up version, including visualizations, based on our recently developed prediction model. We conducted focus groups with CVA patients and informal caregivers, and separate focus groups with health care professionals (HCPs). Their opinions on the current information management and the model were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Lastly, a Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovations (MIDI) questionnaire was used to collect insights into the prediction model and visualizations with HCPs.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis of 6 focus groups, with 9 patients, 4 informal caregivers, and 8 HCPs, resulted in 10 themes in 3 categories: evaluation of the current care process (information absorption, expectations of rehabilitation, prediction of outcomes, and decision aid), content of the prediction model (reliability, relevance, and influence on the care process), and accessibility of the model (ease of understanding, model type preference, and moment of use). We extracted recommendations for the prediction model and visualizations. The results of the questionnaire survey (9 responses, 56% response rate) underscored the themes of the focus groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a need for the use of a prediction model to assess CVA outcomes, as indicated by the general approval of participants in both the focus groups and the questionnaire survey. We recommend that the prediction model be geared toward HCPs, as they can provide the context necessary for patients and informal caregivers.

39845890,Multiscale Three-Dimensional Evaluation and Analysis of Murine Lung Vasculature From Macro- to Micro-Structural Level.,"The pulmonary vasculature plays a pivotal role in the development and progress of chronic lung diseases. Due to limitations of conventional two-dimensional histological methods, the complexity and the detailed anatomy of the lung blood circulation might be overlooked. In this study, we demonstrate the practical use of optical serial block face imaging (SBFI), ex vivo microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), and nondestructive optical tomography for visualization and quantification of the pulmonary circulation's 3D architecture from macro- to micro-structural levels in murine lung samples. We demonstrate that SBFI can provide rapid, cost-effective, and label-free visualization of mouse lung macrostructures and large pulmonary vessels. Micro-CT offers high-resolution imaging and captures microvascular and (pre)capillary structures, with microstructural quantification. Optical microscopy techniques such as optical projection tomography (OPT) and light sheet fluorescence microscopy, allows noninvasive, mesoscopic imaging of optically cleared mouse lungs, still enabling 3D microscopic reconstruction down to the precapillary level. By integrating SBFI, micro-CT, and nondestructive optical microscopy, we provide a framework for detailed and 3D understanding of the pulmonary circulation, with emphasis on vascular pruning and rarefaction. Our study showcases the applicability and complementarity of these techniques for organ-level vascular imaging, offering researchers flexibility in selecting the optimal approach based on their specific requirements. In conclusion, we propose 3D-directed approaches for a detailed whole-organ view on the pulmonary vasculature in health and disease, to advance our current knowledge of diseases affecting the pulmonary vasculature.",Tielemans B; Marain NF; Kerstens A; Peredo N; Coll-Lladó M; Gritti N; de Villemagne P; Dorval P; Geudens V; Orlitová M; Munck S; Leszczyński B; Swoger J; Velde GV,"Department of Imaging and Pathology, Biomedical MRI KU Leuven Leuven Belgium.",Pulmonary circulation,2025-01-21,10.1002/pul2.70038,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Optical imaging; Microcomputed Tomography; Pulmonary Vasculature; Serial Block Face Imaging; 3D Visualization And Evaluation

39833870,Visualization using NIPTviewer support the clinical interpretation of noninvasive prenatal testing results.,"<h4>Background</h4>Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is increasingly used to screen for fetal chromosomal aneuploidy by analyzing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in peripheral maternal blood. The method provides an opportunity for early detection of large genetic abnormalities without an increased risk of miscarriage due to invasive procedures. Commercial applications for use at clinical laboratories often take advantage of DNA sequencing technologies and include the bioinformatic workup of the sequence data. The interpretation of the test results and the clinical report writing, however, remains the responsibility of the diagnostic laboratory. In order to facilitate this step, we developed NIPTviewer, a web-based application to visualize and guide the interpretation of NIPT data results.<h4>Results</h4>NIPTviewer has a database functionality to store the NIPT results and a web interface for user interaction and visualization. The application has been implemented as part of a novel analysis pipeline for NIPT in a diagnostic laboratory at Uppsala University Hospital. The validation data set included 84 previously analyzed plasma samples with known results regarding chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. They were sequenced in six different experiments, uploaded to NIPTviewer and assigned to a clinical laboratory geneticist for interpretation. The results of all previously analyzed samples were replicated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>NIPTviewer facilitates NIPT results interpretation and has been implemented as part of a NIPT analysis routine that was accredited by the national accreditation body for Sweden (Swedac).",Smeds P; Baranowska Körberg I; Melin M; Ladenvall C,"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, SE-751 85, Sweden.",BMC medical genomics,2025-01-20,10.1186/s12920-025-02086-8,7.0,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract)",Aneuploidy; Screening; Trisomy; Diagnostics; Web Application; Cell-free Dna; Non-invasive Prenatal Testing (Nipt); Veriseq Nipt Solution
39838379,"Functional genomic imaging (FGI), a virtual tool for visualization of functional gene expression modules in heterogeneous tumor samples.","Advances in sequencing technologies are reshaping clinical diagnostics, prompting the development of new software tools to decipher big data. To this end, we developed functional genomic imaging (FGI), a visualization tool designed to assist clinicians in interpreting RNA-Seq results from patient samples. FGI uses weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), followed by a modified Phenograph clustering algorithm to identify co-expression gene clusters. These gene modules were annotated and projected onto a t-SNE map for visualization. Annotation of FGI gene clusters revealed three categories: tissue-specific, functional, and positional. These clusters may be used to build tumor subtypes with pre-annotated functions. At the multi-cancer cohort level, tissue-specific clusters are enriched, whereas at the single cancer level, such as in lung cancer or ovarian cancer, positional clusters can be more prominent. Moreover, FGI analysis could also reveal molecular tumor subtypes not documented in clinical records and generated a more detailed co-expression gene cluster map. Based on different levels of FGI modeling, each individual tumor sample can be customized to display various types of information such as tissue origin, molecular subtypes, immune activation status, stromal signaling pathways, cell cycle activity, and potential amplicon regions which can aid in diagnosis and guide treatment decisions. Our results highlight the potential of FGI as a robust visualization tool for personalized medicine in molecular diagnosis.",Chen X; Guo Y; Gu X; Wen D,"Shanghai LIDE Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, 201203, China.",Biology direct,2025-01-21,10.1186/s13062-025-00598-y,7.0,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract)",Co-expression; Wgcna; Functional Genomic Imaging (Fgi)
39853875,Turning Waste into Treasure: Functionalized Biomass-Derived Carbon Dots for Superselective Visualization and Eradication of Gram-Positive Bacteria. ,"Gram-positive bacteria pose significant threats to human health, necessitating the development of targeted bacterial detection and eradication strategies. Nevertheless, current approaches often suffer from poor targeting specificity. Herein, the study utilizes purple rice lixivium to synthesize biomass carbon dots (termed BCDs) with wheat germ agglutinin-like residues for precisely targeting Gram-positive bacteria. Subsequently, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules are grafted onto BCDs to yield FITC-labeled BCDs (termed CDFs), which can selectively and rapidly (≤5 min) stain bacterial cell wall and particularly target the peptidoglycan component. Strikingly, CDFs achieve superselective visualization of Gram-positive bacteria even in the presence of mammalian cells and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, protoporphyrin (PpIX) molecules are conjugated onto BCDs to yield PpIX-modified BCDs (termed CDPs), which can induce bacterial aggregation and in situ generate singlet oxygen for realizing enhanced antibacterial photodynamic therapy (PDT). At the minimum bactericidal concentration of CDPs (PpIX: 5 µg mL-1), CDP-mediated PDT disrupts bacterial structure and metabolism pathways, thereby affecting bacterial interactions to eradicate biofilms. Importantly, CDP-mediated PDT efficiently modulates antiinflammatory responses to promote wound healing in the bacteria-infected mice. This study underscores the significance of harnessing renewable and cost-effective biomass resources for preparing Gram-positive bacteria-targeting theranostic agents, which may find potential clinical applications in the future.",Xu KF; Wang Z; Cui M; Jiang Y; Li C; Wang ZX; Li LY; Jia C; Zhang L; Wu FG,"State Key Laboratory of Digital Medical Engineering, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, 2 Southeast University Road, Nanjing, 211189, P.

39840963,LI-RADS Ultrasound Surveillance Version 2024: Comparison With Version 2017 for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Detection and Risk Factors for Visualization Score C.,"<b>Background:</b> The LI-RADS Ultrasound Surveillance algorithm was updated in 2024, incorporating alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and visualization score of VIS-C into management recommendations after nonpositive results. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS Ultrasound Surveillance version 2017 (v2017) and version 2024 (v2024) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection in at-risk patients and to identify predictors of VIS-C on follow-up surveillance examinations. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective analysis included 407 patients (median age, 56 years; 230 male, 177 female) with cirrhosis who underwent rounds of semi-annual surveillance ultrasound as part of a prospective trial from November 2011 to December 2012. Two radiologists independently assigned ultrasound categories to round-1 examinations and visualization scores to round-1 and round-2 examinations; a third radiologist adjudicated disagreements. AFP was considered positive if elevated or increasing from pre-enrollment values, per v2024 criteria. Reference standard for HCC was positive biopsy or LR-5 observation on MRI. Diagnostic performance was compared between v2017 and v2024. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of round-2 VIS-C, with attention to risk factors for VIS-C described in v2024. <b>Results:</b> HCC was diagnosed in 28 (6.9%) patients. For reader 1, v2024, compared with v2017, showed greater sensitivity for reader 1 (64.3% vs 42.9%, p=.03) and reader 2 (64.3% vs 39.3%, p=.02), and lower specificity for reader 1 (82.0% vs 92.6%, p<.001) and reader 2 (82.3% vs 92.9%, p<.001). All seven patients with HCC detected by v2024 but not v2017 using consensus assessments had an increasing AFP; two also had an elevated AFP. In 299 patients who underwent round-2 ultrasound after negative round-1 v2024 surveillance results, the only independent predictor of round-2 VIS-C was round-1 VIS-C (adjusted OR=21.0, [95% CI, 10.8-40.8], p<.001). In 88 of these patients with round-1 VIS-C, no v2024 risk factor showed significant univariable association with repeat VIS-C. <b>Conclusion:</b> Compared with v2017, LI-RADS Ultrasound Surveillance v2024 had higher sensitivity but lower specificity for HCC detection, related primarily to increasing, rather than elevated, AFP. The only independent predictor of VIS-C on subsequent ultrasound was initial VIS-C result. <b>Clinical Impact:</b> The findings support use of v2024 to improve HCC detection in at-risk patients.",Heo S; Kim SY; Lee SJ; Lee SS; Byun JH; Won HJ; Shin YM; Choi SH; Sirlin CB,"Department of Radiology and Research Institute of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.",AJR.

39833853,Multimodal data-based longitudinal prognostic model for predicting atrial fibrillation recurrence after catheter ablation in patients with patent foramen ovale and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Clinical studies on atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after catheter ablation in patients diagnosed with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and paroxysmal AF (PAF) are scarce. Here, we aimed to develop a nomogram model utilizing multimodal data for the risk stratification of AF recurrence following catheter ablation in individuals diagnosed with PFO and new-onset PAF.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients with PFO and PAF who underwent catheter ablation at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 2018 to June 2020 were consecutively enrolled. The identification of potential risk factors was conducted using the regression method known as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Subsequently, multivariate COX regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent risk factors, after which a nomogram scoring system was developed. The nomogram's performance was assessed via various statistical measures, including receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>The dataset was partitioned into the development cohort (n = 102) and the validation cohort (n = 43) using a 7:3 ratio. The constructed nomogram included four clinical variables: age, diabetes mellitus, lipoprotein (a), and right ventricular diameter. The area under the curve values of the development and validation cohorts at 1, 2, and 3 years post-catheter ablation were 0.911, 0.812, and 0.786 and 0.842, 0.761, and 0.785, respectively. Additionally, the nomogram demonstrated a significant correlation between the predicted and actual outcomes in the development and validation cohorts, indicating its excellent calibration. Lastly, the DCA findings suggested that the model had notable clinical applicability in predicting the likelihood of AF recurrence within 1, 2, and 3 years after catheter ablation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The incorporation of multimodal data in a nomogram visualization tool facilitates the concise representation of multimodal data, thereby enhancing the comprehension of the clinical status of patients with PFO and PAF following catheter ablation and providing accurate risk stratification at 1, 2, and 3 years post-treatment.<h4>Trial registration</h4>This trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.

This study aimed to develop and validate a novel deep learning network using baseline computed tomography (CT) images to predict the classification of pancreatic lesions.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study included 864 patients (422 men, 442 women) with confirmed histopathological results across three medical centers, forming a training cohort, internal testing cohort, and external validation cohort. A novel hybrid model, Multi-Scale Large Kernel Attention with Mobile Vision Transformer (MVIT-MLKA), was developed, integrating CNN and Transformer architectures to classify pancreatic lesions. The model's performance was compared with traditional machine learning methods and advanced deep learning models. We also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists with and without the assistance of the optimal model. Model performance was assessed through discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability.<h4>Results</h4>The MVIT-MLKA model demonstrated superior performance in classifying pancreatic lesions, achieving an AUC of 0.974 (95% CI 0.967-0.980) in the training set, 0.935 (95% CI 0.915-0.954) in the internal testing set, and 0.924 (95% CI 0.902-0.945) in the external validation set, outperforming traditional models and other deep learning models (P < 0.05). Radiologists aided by the MVIT-MLKA model showed significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared to those without model assistance (P < 0.05).

39837756,[Content and quality of web-based health information for the prevention and prediction of food allergies in children: A systematic evaluation].,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Web-based health information can support health-related decisions if it is of high quality, i. e. accurate, understandable and barrier-free. Our study systematically searched for German-language, web-based health information on the prevention and prediction of food allergies in children and assessed their content and quality.<h4>Methods</h4>In July 2022, four researchers conducted a systematic Google search for German-language web-based health information (HI) on the prediction and prevention of food allergies in children. They searched independently of each other with a predefined search algorithm. Two independent reviewers analyzed the data using qualitative and quantitative content analysis (step/analysis 1) and assessed the quality of HI (step/analysis 2) using a comprehensive criteria catalog (transparency, text design, content, language, presentation of frequencies and statistical information, visualization, and accessibility).<h4>Results</h4>The systematic search yielded 59 websites, which were provided by nine sectors. The most frequent sectors were ""Health portals and expert opinions"" and ""Guidelines/scientific and medical specialized information"" (22 % each). The content analysis (step 1) showed, among other things, that the topic of prediction was only implicitly addressed. 49 materials (83 %) contained guideline-compliant information. However, there were also 26 materials (44 %) whose content was not in line with the current S3 guideline on allergy prevention. Quality assessment (step 2) revealed that only a small number of the 43 HI received good or very good ratings regarding the transparency (n = 3, 7 %) and content (n = 9, 21 %) criteria. The criterion concerning frequencies and statistical information was rated good or very good quality in only 11 HI (26 %). Almost all HI met the quality criteria for language (n = 38, 88 %), text design (n = 43, 100 %), and visualization (n = 43, 100 %). None of the evaluated HI was given a good or very good rating in terms of accessibility criteria. The analysis by sector revealed only minor differences (Mean of the seven criteria: 56-69 %).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The quality of the available web-based health information on the prevention and prediction of food allergies in children is highly heterogeneous. There is need for improvement in terms of accessibility, content (e. g., selective presentation of prevention measures), and transparency (e. g., missing details of contacts). Further research is needed for expanding the user perspective and analyzing social media in the context of prediction and prevention of food allergies in children.",Hörold M; Rohr M; Beyer M; Bauer T; König M; Gerhardinger K; Apfelbacher C; Brandstetter S,"Institut für Sozialmedizin und Gesundheitssystemforschung, Medizinische Fakultät, Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Deutschland.

39832267,Enhancing panoramic dental imaging with AI-driven arch surface fitting: Achieving improved clarity and accuracy through an optimal reconstruction zone.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to develop an automated method for generating clearer, well-aligned panoramic views by creating an optimized three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction zone centered on the teeth. The approach focused on achieving high contrast and clarity in key dental features, including tooth roots, morphology, and periapical lesions, by applying a 3D U-Net deep learning model to generate an arch surface and align the panoramic view.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study analyzed anonymized cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans from 312 patients (mean age 40 years; range 10-78; 41.3% male, 58.7% female). A 3D U-Net deep learning model segmented the jaw and dentition, facilitating panoramic view generation. During preprocessing, CBCT scans were binarized, and a cylindrical reconstruction method aligned the arch along a straight coordinate system, reducing data size for efficient processing. The 3D U-Net segmented the jaw and dentition in two steps, after which the panoramic view was reconstructed using 3D spline curves fitted to the arch, defining the optimal 3D reconstruction zone. This ensured the panoramic view captured essential anatomical details with high contrast and clarity. To evaluate performance, we compared contrast between tooth roots and alveolar bone and assessed intersection over union (IoU) values for tooth shapes and periapical lesions (#42, #44, #46) relative to the conventional method, demonstrating enhanced clarity and improved visualization of critical dental structures.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed method outperformed the conventional approach, showing significant improvements in the contrast between tooth roots and alveolar bone, particularly for tooth #42. It also demonstrated higher IoU values in tooth morphology comparisons, indicating superior shape alignment. Additionally, when evaluating periapical lesions, our method achieved higher performance with thinner layers, resulting in several statistically significant outcomes. Specifically, average pixel values within lesions were higher for certain layer thicknesses, demonstrating enhanced visibility of lesion boundaries and better visualization.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The fully automated AI-based panoramic view generation method successfully created a 3D reconstruction zone centered on the teeth, enabling consistent observation of dental and surrounding tissue structures with high contrast across reconstruction widths. By accurately segmenting the dental arch and defining the optimal reconstruction zone, this method shows significant advantages in detecting pathological changes, potentially reducing clinician fatigue during interpretation while enhancing clinical decision-making accuracy. Future research will focus on further developing and testing this approach to ensure robust performance across diverse patient cases with varied dental and maxillofacial structures, thereby increasing the model's utility in clinical settings.<h4>Advances in knowledge</h4>This study introduces a novel method for achieving clearer, well-aligned panoramic views focused on the dentition, providing significant improvements over conventional methods.",Kim N; Park H; Jung YH; Hwang JJ,"Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, Korea.",Dento maxillo facial radiology,2025-01-20,10.1093/dmfr/twaf006,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
39838176,Clinical application of 3D slicer reconstruction and 3D printing localization combined with neuroendoscopy technology in VPS surgery.,"To explore techniques, advantages and disadvantages of 3D Slicer reconstruction and 3D printing localization technology combined with transcranial neuroendoscopy in ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. Retrospective analysis of clinical data of patients with hydrocephalus treated by ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery using 3D Slicer reconstruction and 3D printing positioning technology combined with transcranial neuroendoscopy in our hospital from October 2021 to March 2023. A total of 33 patients with complete data were collected, including 19 males and 14 females, aged 10-81 years. Pre operative use of 3D Slicer reconstruction and 3D printing localization, and intraoperative use of neuroendoscopy assisted catheterization to complete ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. The drainage tube position was confirmed by brain CT and 3D Slicer reconstruction after operation, of which 30 cases were located in the frontal horn or center of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle, and 3 cases were located in the frontal horn or center of the contralateral lateral ventricle. All patients were successfully catheterized and well positioned. According to the unique ventricular system characteristics of each hydrocephalus patient, the 3D Slicer reconstruction technology was used to determine the individualized puncture point and direction, measure the puncture depth, accurately locate the puncture through the 3D printing guide plate, and accurately send the tip of the ventricular catheter into the frontal or central part of the lateral ventricle with the assistance of neuroendoscopic visualization, which improved the success rate of the operation and reduced the risk of tube blockage. At the same time, our team has newly developed a puncture point (""Cai's point""), which has a puncture path in a non-vascular area and can reduce the risk of puncture bleeding. However, further prospective clinical research is needed to determine its routine location.",Zhou L; Lei P; Song P; Li Z; Zhang H; Wei H; Gao L; Hua Q; Ye H; Chen Q; Zhang S; Cai Q,"Department of Neurosurgery, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, No. 238, Jiefang Road, Wuchang District, Wuhan, 430060, Hubei, China.",Scientific reports,2025-01-21,10.1038/s41598-025-86731-3,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Hydrocephalus; Neuroendoscope; Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt; 3D Printing; 3D Slicer
39849353,Construction and evaluation of a triage assessment model for patients with acute non-traumatic chest pain: mixed retrospective and prospective observational study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Acute non-traumatic chest pain is one of the common complaints in the emergency department and is closely associated with fatal disease. Triage assessment urgently requires the use of simple, rapid tools to screen patients with chest pain for high-risk condition to improve patient outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>After data preprocessing and feature selection, univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify potential predictors associated with acute non-traumatic chest pain. A nomogram was built based on the predictors, and an internal evaluation was performed using bootstrap resampling methods. The model was also externally validated in this center. Furthermore, the model results were risk-stratified using the decision tree analysis to explore the corresponding triage level. Subsequently, we developed an online visualization tool based on the model to assess the risk of high risk in patients with chest pain.<h4>Results</h4>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, smoking, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, pain site, concomitant symptoms, and electrocardiograph, all of which are independent predictors of high-risk chest pain patients. The AUC of our model in the development and validation groups was 0.919 (95%CI: 0.891 ~ 0.974) and 0.904 (95%CI: 0.855 ~ 0.952). Moreover, our model demonstrated better outcomes in terms of accuracy/sensitivity in both cohorts (81.9%/85.2% and 94.8%/78.5%). The calibration curve shows a high degree of agreement between the predicted and actual probabilities. Decision curve analysis clarified that our model had higher net gains across the entire range of clinical thresholds. Afterward, we developed an online tool, which is used in the triage link to facilitate nurses to screen people with high-risk chest pain.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We proposed an accurate model to predict the high-risk populations with chest pain, based on which a simple and rapid online tool was developed and provided substantial support for its application as a decision-making tool for the emergency department.<h4>Registration</h4>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee Board of Fujian Provincial Hospital.<h4>Clinical trial registration number</h4>ChiCTR2200061918.",Zhou X; Jian G; He Y; Huang Y; Zhang J; Wang S; Wang Y; Zheng R,"The School of Nursing, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.",BMC emergency medicine,2025-01-23,10.1186/s12873-025-01176-1,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Chest pain; Risk stratification; Triage; Risk Prediction Model
39746309,Real-time CBCT imaging and motion tracking via a single arbitrarily-angled x-ray projection by a joint dynamic reconstruction and motion estimation (DREME) framework.,"<i>Objective.</i>Real-time cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides instantaneous visualization of patient anatomy for image guidance, motion tracking, and online treatment adaptation in radiotherapy. While many real-time imaging and motion tracking methods leveraged patient-specific prior information to alleviate under-sampling challenges and meet the temporal constraint (<500 ms), the prior information can be outdated and introduce biases, thus compromising the imaging and motion tracking accuracy. To address this challenge, we developed a framework<u>d</u>ynamic<u>re</u>construction and<u>m</u>otion<u>e</u>stimation (DREME) for real-time CBCT imaging and motion estimation, without relying on patient-specific prior knowledge.<i>Approach.</i>DREME incorporates a deep learning-based real-time CBCT imaging and motion estimation method into a dynamic CBCT reconstruction framework. The reconstruction framework reconstructs a dynamic sequence of CBCTs in a data-driven manner from a standard pre-treatment scan, without requiring patient-specific prior knowledge. Meanwhile, a convolutional neural network-based motion encoder is jointly trained during the reconstruction to learn motion-related features relevant for real-time motion estimation, based on a single arbitrarily-angled x-ray projection. DREME was tested on digital phantom simulations and real patient studies.<i>Main Results.</i>DREME accurately solved 3D respiration-induced anatomical motion in real time (∼1.5 ms inference time for each x-ray projection). For the digital phantom studies, it achieved an average lung tumor center-of-mass localization error of 1.2 ± 0.9 mm (Mean ± SD). For the patient studies, it achieved a real-time tumor localization accuracy of 1.6 ± 1.6 mm in the projection domain.<i>Significance.</i>DREME achieves CBCT and volumetric motion estimation in real time from a single x-ray projection at arbitrary angles, paving the way for future clinical applications in intra-fractional motion management. In addition, it can be used for dose tracking and treatment assessment, when combined with real-time dose calculation.",Shao HC; Mengke T; Pan T; Zhang Y,"The Medical Artificial Intelligence and Automation (MAIA) Laboratory, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States of America.",Physics in medicine and biology,2025-01-21,10.1088/1361-6560/ada519,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),X-ray; Motion model; Motion Estimation; Real-time Imaging; Deep Learning; Dynamic Cbct Reconstruction

Despite significant advancements in the past century, traditional <sup>1</sup>H MRI still faces sensitivity limitations that hinder its further development. To overcome this challenge, hyperpolarization methods have been introduced, disrupting the thermal equilibrium of nuclear spins and leading to an increased proportion of hyperpolarized spins, thereby enhancing sensitivity by hundreds to tens of thousands of times. Among these methods, hyperpolarized (HP) <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI, also known as ultrasensitive <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI, stands out for achieving the highest polarization enhancement and has recently received clinical approval. It effectively tackles the challenge of weak MRI signals from low proton density in the lungs.

39838221,Automatic skeletal maturity grading from pelvis radiographs by deep learning for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional spine deformity governed of the spine. A child's Risser stage of skeletal maturity must be carefully considered for AIS evaluation and treatment. However, there are intra-observer and inter-observer inaccuracies in the Risser stage manual assessment. A multi-task learning approach is proposed to address the low precision issue of manual assessment. With our developed multi-task learning approach, the iliac area is extracted and forwarded to the improved Swin Transformer for Risser stage assessment. The spatial and channel reconstruction convolutional Swin block is adapted to each stage of the Swin Transformer to achieve better performance. The Risser stage assessment based on iliac region extraction had an overall accuracy of 81.53%. The accuracy increased in comparison to ResNet50, ResNet101, Uni-former, Next-ViT, ConvNeXt, and the original Swin Transformer by 5.85%, 4.6%, 3.6%, 2.7%, 2.25%, and 1.8%, respectively. The Grad-CAM visualization is used to understand the interpretability of our proposed model. The results show that the proposed multi-task learning strategy performs well on the Risser stage assessment.

39846479,Fundamental Understanding of Bio-Nano Interface of Lysozyme on &lt;i&gt;Psidium guajava&lt;/i&gt; Polyphenol Coated Silver Nanoparticles: Mechanistic Insights into the Effect of Protein Corona on the Antibacterial Efficacy.,"Recent times have witnessed revolutionary progress in the design and development of functionalized nanomaterials as promising tools for biomedicinal applications. However, the gap in the fundamental understanding of the ""biological responses"" of the nanomaterials after the formation of ""protein-corona"" when it is exposed to the body system has drawn a thin line from its discoveries to real clinical trial. In this article we have synthesized two different silver NPs capped with the polyphenols of <i>Psidium guajava</i> (guava) leaf extract and the other with one of its major polyphenolic groups, morin. Then, the formation of ""bio-nano interface"" of these synthesized AgNPs were illustrated in detail by taking the model carrier protein hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). The formation of protein corona of HEWL on the surface of the AgNPs was revealed by the increase in the hydrodynamic size and the negative ξ-potential values as well as from the visualization of an ∼1 nm thick light gray layer of HEWL in the TEM micrographs. The binding interaction of surface adsorbed HEWL with the AgNPs was analyzed with various photophysical and molecular dynamics simulation (MD) techniques. HEWL interacted with these polyphenol-assisted AgNPs with moderate binding affinity (<i>K</i><sub>b</sub> ∼ 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) in a spontaneous manner with the structural integrity in its native conformation. Though several covalent forces are responsible for protein-NP interaction, electrostatic and hydrophobic forces of attraction played the major role in the complexation of HEWL with Guava L.-AgNPs and Morin-AgNPs, respectively. The lysozyme protein-corona on the synthesized polyphenol-assisted AgNPs altered their biological response as revealed from the reduction of antibacterial activity against pathological Gram-positive (<i>E. faecalis</i>) as well as Gram-negative (<i>E. coli</i>) bacterial strains <i>in vitro</i>.",Baruah K; Singh AK; Lyndem S; Kumari K; Jha AN; Singha Roy A,"Department of Chemical and Biological Sciences, National Institute of Technology Meghalaya, Shillong 793003, India.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2025-01-23,10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c04832,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
39840785,Does Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak in Pituitary Surgery Affect Patient Reported Quality of Life?,"<h4>Background</h4>Endoscopic techniques allow for improved visualization and tumor debulking of pituitary adenomas. More thorough tumor resection, however, can be associated with higher rates of CSF leaks. We set out to determine if CSF leaks influenced patient perceived quality of life outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study included 152 patients who underwent endoscopic pituitary tumor resection over a 10-year period. QoL was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire and completed before surgery, 6 weeks and 6 months post-operatively. Statistical analysis was conducted using a equivalence test and a two-way mixed model ANOVA to assess intraoperative CSF leak, postoperative CSF leak, redo surgery, and the use of a lumbar drain.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 152 patients, 98 had a potential intraoperative CSF leak. Intra- and postoperative CSF leaks did not significantly impact patient reported QoL outcomes at 6 months following surgery. There was clinical equivalence in mental scores as early as 6 weeks and 6 months for physical scores. There was no statistically significant difference in physical (p-value = 0.975) and mental (p = 0.204) scores for patients who experienced a postoperative CSF leak. There was no statistically significant difference in QoL in the mental and physical scores for patients that received a lumbar drain (physical score p = 0.832; mental score p = 0.915) or redo surgery (physical score p = 0.830; mental score p = 0.204).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This article demonstrates that CSF leaks do not impact patient-reported QoL outcomes at 6 months post-surgery. This will allow surgeons to better provide insight and counsel patients regarding the relevance of CSF leaks in the setting of pituitary procedures.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>III Laryngoscope, 2025.",Duggal C; Detombe S; Lefteris A; Van Uum S; Sowerby L; Duggal N; Rotenberg B,"Department of Otolaryngology- Head & Neck Surgery, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.",The Laryngoscope,2025-01-22,10.1002/lary.32007,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Skull Base Surgery; Pituitary Surgery; Cerebrospinal Fluid (Csf) Leak; Endoscopic Endonasal Surgery (Ees); Sf‐36 Quality Of Life (Qol) Questionnaire
39843313,Transvestibular Chondrolarynoplasty-Experimental Study in Cadavers.,"<h4>Background</h4>The neck, and specifically the prominence of the thyroid cartilage, can be considered a marker of male gender, which is often unwanted by transgender women. Chondrolaryngoplasty is traditionally performed using an open transcervical approach, which, while effective, leaves visible scars that can compromise patient satisfaction. Recent advancements, such as the transoral endoscopic vestibular approach (TOEVA), have emerged as promising alternatives, eliminating external scars and improving esthetic outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Endoscope-guided transoral buccal dissections of five human cadavers' necks were performed to visualize and expose the thyroid cartilage, followed by the chondrolaryngoplasty procedure by the same route. The technique involved three oral vestibule incisions for trocar placement, subplatysmal dissection, and resection of the thyroid cartilage prominence using laparoscopic instruments. A specially designed endoscopic rasp was utilized to refine cartilage contours.<h4>Results</h4>Chondrolaryngoplasty using a transoral approach proved feasible, allowing the thyroid prominence to be reduced without an apparent scar. Visualization and instrument manipulation were successful in three cases, with adaptations required in two cases due to rigor mortis altering anatomical positioning. Complications included two minor skin perforations and instrument breakage in a case with calcified cartilage, necessitating alternative tools. There were some complications related to cadaveric phenomena.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Performing the procedure on cadavers presented some limitations related to cadaveric phenomena, such as skin stiffness and loss of elasticity, as well as difficulties with mobility, making the surgical procedure difficult. Despite these challenges, the procedure achieved satisfactory esthetic outcomes, with precise cartilage reduction and no visible scars. The procedure proved to be viable, achieving the goal of reducing the prominence of the thyroid cartilage while avoiding an apparent scar.

39833908,NKX6.3 modulation of mitotic dynamics and genomic stability in gastric carcinogenesis. ,"Gastric cancer remains a significant global health challenge, characterized by poor prognosis and high mortality rates. Mitotic integrity and genomic stability are crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. The transcription factor NKX6.3 has emerged as a potential regulator of these processes in gastric epithelial cells, prompting an investigation into its role in gastric cancer development. We employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques to elucidate the impact of NKX6.3 depletion on mitotic dynamics and genomic stability in gastric epithelial cells. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were conducted to assess the expression of mitosis-related genes and proteins. Flow cytometry was utilized to evaluate cell cycle distribution, while immunofluorescence microscopy enabled the visualization of mitotic abnormalities. Statistical analyses, including Student's t-test and ANOVA, were performed to determine the significance of our findings. Our results demonstrate that NKX6.3 depletion leads to significant mitotic defects, characterized by increased chromosome misalignment and lagging chromosomes during anaphase. These abnormalities corresponded with elevated levels of genomic instability markers, indicating compromised genomic integrity. Furthermore, the loss of NKX6.3 resulted in altered expression of key regulatory proteins involved in mitosis and DNA repair pathways, suggesting a mechanistic link between NKX6.3 and the maintenance of genomic stability in gastric epithelial cells. Depletion of NKX6.3 resulted in accelerated cell cycle progression and the formation of abnormal mitotic figures, leading to genomic instability characterized by increased DNA content and structural abnormalities. In both in vitro and xenograft models, the depletion of NKX6.3 significantly upregulated AurkA and TPX2, which correlated with gains in DNA copy number. An inverse relationship was observed between NKX6.3 expression and the levels of AurkA and TPX2 in human gastric cancer tissues. This study highlights the essential role of NKX6.3 in regulating mitotic integrity and genomic stability in gastric carcinogenesis. The findings suggest that targeting NKX6.3 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for improving treatment outcomes in gastric cancer by restoring mitotic fidelity and genomic stability.

39838364,Robust circulating microRNA signature for the diagnosis and early detection of pancreatobiliary cancer.,"<h4>Background</h4>A new circulating biomarker superior to carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is needed for diagnosing pancreatobiliary cancer (PBca). The aim of this study was to identify serum microRNA (miRNA) signatures comprising reproducible and disease-related miRNAs.<h4>Methods</h4>This multicenter study involved patients with treatment-naïve PBca and healthy participants. The optimized serum processing conditions were evaluated using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization. Serum miRNA candidates for disease association were selected using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). A miRNA signature combining multiple serum miRNAs was tested in exploratory, validation, and independent validation sets. The synthesis and secretion of diagnostic miRNAs were evaluated using human pancreatic cancer cells.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 284 (150 healthy and 134 PBca) of 827 serum samples were processed within 2 h of blood collection before freezing, distributed in the same area as that in the t-SNE map, and assigned to an exploratory set. The 193 optimized samples were assigned to either the validation (50 healthy, 47 PBca) or independent validation (50 healthy, 46 PBca) set. Index-1, a combination of five serum miRNAs (hsa-miR-1343-5p, hsa-miR-4632-5p, hsa-miR-4665-5p, hsa-miR-665, and hsa-miR-6803-5p) with disease association in WGCNA, showed a sensitivity and specificity of > 80% and an AUC outperforming that of CA19-9 in the exploratory, validation, and independent validation sets. The AUC of Index-1 was superior to that of CA19-9 (0.856 vs. 0.649, p = 0.038) for detecting T1 tumors. miR-665, a component of Index-1, was expressed in human pancreatic cancer cells, and its transfection inhibited cell growth.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The serum miRNA signature Index-1 is useful for detecting PBca and could facilitate the early diagnosis of PBca.

To develop a deep learning framework to synthesize [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images from real [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET images and leverage their cross-modal correlation to distinguish PD from normal control (NC).<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a deep learning framework to synthesize [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images from real [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET images, and leveraged their cross-modal correlation to distinguish PD from NC. A total of 604 participants (274 with PD and 330 with NC) who underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET scans were included. The quality of the synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images was evaluated through quantitative comparison with the ground-truth images and radiologist visual assessment. The evaluations of PD diagnosis performance were conducted using biomarker-based quantitative analyses (using striatal binding ratios from synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images) and the proposed PD classifier (incorporating both real [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images).<h4>Results</h4>Visualization result shows that the synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images resemble the real ones with no significant differences visible in the error maps. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated that synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images exhibited a high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR: 25.0-28.0) and structural similarity (SSIM: 0.87-0.96) across different unilateral striatal subregions. The radiologists achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 91.9% (± 2.02%) based on synthetic [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET images, while biomarker-based quantitative analysis of the posterior putamen yielded an AUC of 0.912 (95% CI, 0.889-0.936), and the proposed PD Classifier achieved an AUC of 0.937 (95% CI, 0.916-0.957).<h4>Conclusion</h4>By bridging the gap between [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT, our deep learning framework can significantly enhance PD diagnosis without the need for [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT tracers, thereby expanding the reach of advanced diagnostic tools to clinical settings where [<sup>11</sup>C]CFT PET imaging is inaccessible.",Shen Z; Wang J; Huang H; Lu J; Ge J; Xiong H; Wu P; Ju Z; Lin H; Zhu Y; Yang Y; Liu F; Guan Y; Sun K; Wang J; Wang Q; Zuo C,"School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,2025-01-20,10.1007/s00259-025-07096-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Diagnosis; Parkinson’s Disease; [18F]fdg Pet; [11C]cft Pet; Cross-modality Image Synthesis
39838909,Medial Meniscotibial Ligament Deficiency Increases Medial Meniscus Extrusion and Posterior Root Forces.,"<h4>Background</h4>There is growing evidence that medial meniscotibial ligament (MTL) deficiency and medial meniscus extrusion may precede the development of some medial meniscus posterior root (MMPR) tears. However, no study has investigated the biomechanical consequences of MTL deficiency on the MMPR.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>(1) MTL deficiency leads to increased medial meniscus extrusion, (2) increased medial meniscus extrusion is correlated with increased compression and shear forces at the MMPR, and (3) MTL repair restores medial meniscus extrusion and MMPR forces to native levels.<h4>Study design</h4>Controlled laboratory study.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifteen pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were tested. Specimens were organized into 3 groups according to a balanced incomplete block design: (1) native, (2) MTL deficiency, and (3) MTL repair. For the MTL deficiency group, a 3-cm deficiency in the MTL was developed under direct arthroscopic visualization. Specimens in the MTL repair group underwent a 2-anchor repair that compressed the joint capsule to the proximal tibia. All specimens were biomechanically tested in full extension with a tensile testing machine. The specimens underwent cyclic loading for 10,000 cycles at 1 Hz and compression of 20 to 500 N, with a 500-N compressive force applied for 30 seconds after the 0th, 100th, 1000th, and 10,000th cycles. Ultrasound was used to measure medial meniscus extrusion. Shear and compressive forces at the MMPR were measured with a 3-axis sensor installed inferior to the MMPR tibial attachment.<h4>Results</h4>Medial meniscus extrusion was significantly increased in the MTL deficiency group compared with the native group (0th: 1.6 ± 0.1 mm vs 1.2 ± 0.1 mm, <i>P</i> < .05; 100th: 2.2 ± 0.2 mm vs 1.5 ± 0.2 mm, <i>P</i> < .05; 1000th: 2.8 ± 0.2 mm vs 1.8 ± 0.2 mm, <i>P</i> < .05; 10,000th: 3.5 ± 0.3 mm vs 2.1 ± 0.2 mm, <i>P</i> < .05). Compression root force was significantly increased in the MTL deficiency group compared with the native group at all cyclic loading points (0th: 21.7 ± 12.8 N vs 13.6 ± 2.4 N, <i>P</i> < .05; 100th: 18.9 ± 11.0 N vs 12.1 ± 7.5 N, <i>P</i> < .05; 1000th: 16.5 ± 9.9 N vs 11.2 ± 7.5 N, <i>P</i> < .05; 10,000th: 12.6 ± 8.6 N vs 9.0 ± 6.9 N, <i>P</i> < .05). Root shear force was significantly increased in the MTL deficiency group compared with the native group at the 0th (17.5 ± 2.5 N vs 13.6 ± 2.4 N, <i>P</i> < .001) and 100th (16.2 ± 2.6 N vs 12.1 ± 2.2 N, <i>P</i> < .001) cycles. Medial meniscus extrusion, root shear force, and compression root force of the MTL repair group were not significantly different from the native group for all cyclic loading points.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Medial MTL deficiency led to increased medial meniscus extrusion as well as greater compression and shear forces at the MMPR compared with the intact and repaired MTL states, suggesting that MTL deficiency may predispose the MMPR to injury in a cadaveric model.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>MTL deficiency predisposes one to medial meniscus extrusion and MMPR tears. Subsequently, MTL repair can potentially correct medial meniscus extrusion and normalize forces at the MMPR.",Anderson MJJ; Hollenbeck JFM; Drumm AH; Whicker EA; Brown JR; Garcia AR; Apostolakos JM; Buchalter WH; Cortes N; Whalen RJ; Vidal AF; Provencher MT,"The Steadman Clinic, Vail, Colorado, USA.",The American journal of sports medicine,2025-01-22,10.1177/03635465241309671,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Meniscal Extrusion; Meniscus Root Tear; Meniscotibial Ligament Injury; Meniscotibial Ligament Repair
39847731,Development and Implementation of Oral Anticancer Agent Tools for a Thematic Quality Improvement Program: A Collaboration Between Hematology Oncology Pharmacist Association and ASCO Quality Training Program.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The Hematology Oncology Pharmacist Association Oral Chemotherapy Collaborative (HOPA OCC) developed practice-based tools to use in program development and improvement for the management of patients receiving oral anticancer agents (OAAs).<h4>Methods</h4>These tools include a baseline OAA program assessment, clinical OAA adherence tool, and OAA dashboard. HOPA OCC distributed these tools to teams participating in the 6-month HOPA ASCO Quality Training Programs (QTPs). Barriers in the delivery of OAA services across practice sites were determined through the use of baseline assessments, and the following domains were evaluated: (1) side-effect monitoring, (2) adherence monitoring, (3) use of patient-reported outcomes, (4) social determinants of health, and (5) collaborative practice agreements for oncology pharmacists. The OAA adherence tool offers clinical patient adherence questions and guidance for supporting adherence in practice. Finally, the dashboard includes multiple metrics that may be helpful for practices to measure their program outcomes. HOPA OCC used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to assess tool usefulness by the QTP participants.<h4>Results</h4>Barriers to implementation include deficits in information technology, resources, and competing priorities.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Standardized OAA tools can inform and support quality improvement initiatives and improve the care of patients receiving OAAs.",Nachar V; Adams Curry M; Kostoff D; Wood A; Farris KB; Muluneh B; Morris A; Keng M; Guerrier V; Mackler ER,"University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI.",JCO oncology practice,2025-01-23,10.1200/op-24-00475,1.5,dashboard(abstract),
