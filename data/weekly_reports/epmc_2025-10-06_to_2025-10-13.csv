41068563,Complex structural variant visualization with SVTopo.,"<h4>Background</h4>Structural variants are genomic variants that impact at least 50 nucleotides. Structural variants can play major roles in diversity and human health. Many structural variants are difficult to interpret and understand with existing visualization tools, especially when comprised of inverted sequences or multiple breakend pairs.<h4>Results</h4>We present SVTopo, a tool to visualize germline structural variants with supporting evidence from high-accuracy long reads in easily understood figures. We include examples of 101 visually complex structural variants from seven unrelated human genomes, manually assigned to ten categories. These demonstrate a broad spectrum of rearrangement and showcase the frequency of complex structural variants in human genomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SVTopo shows breakpoint evidence in ways that aid reasoning about the impact of multi-breakpoint rearrangements. The images created aid human reasoning about the result of structural variation on gene and regulatory regions.",Belyeu JR; Rowell WJ; Lake JA; Holt JM; Kronenberg Z; Saunders CT; Eberle MA,"Computational Biology, PacBio, 305 O'Brien Drive, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA. jbelyeu@pacb.com.",BMC genomics,2025-10-09,10.1186/s12864-025-12088-6,11.5,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract)",Long-read Sequencing; Genome Visualization; Structural Variant; Complex Sv
41070960,Improved Detection of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid-Induced Fluorescence in Gliomas Using a Novel Handheld Device.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) with 5-aminolevulinic acid enables improved intraoperative visualization of gliomas but is currently limited by the long distance between the light source and tissue of interest. We introduce a novel handheld device (NHD) with a light source at the tip that enables in situ delivery of light to the surgical field; we hypothesized that this close-proximity light source would improve visualization of gliomas. We investigated the feasibility of the NHD for FGS and compared the quality of fluorescence with an existing microscope or exoscope (collectively termed ""scope"") in Vivo (within the surgical field) and ex Vivo (outside the surgical field).<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a prospective clinical study of 18 glioma patients who underwent FGS. During each surgery, 3 areas of tumor were inspected in Vivo and ex Vivo using the scope alone or the scope and the NHD. Fluorescence intensity was scored as none, weak, or strong, and fluorescence character was scored as none, patchy, or uniform. These qualitative descriptions were converted to ordinal scores and compared using Mann-Whitney tests. Fluorescence was further quantified in ImageJ and compared using paired t tests. A neuropathologist performed histopathology studies to verify tumor cell presence and quantify tumor cellularity. Relationships between fluorescence and cellularity were analyzed using Kruskal-Willis tests.<h4>Results</h4>The NHD increased rates of positive fluorescence detection compared with the scope in Vivo and ex Vivo. The NHD significantly improved fluorescence intensity and character in Vivo and ex Vivo, with a mean 2.8-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in Vivo. There was a trend toward increasing tumor cellularity with increasing fluorescence intensity and character.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The NHD was feasible to use and provided clinically meaningful improvements in fluorescence visualization compared with existing intraoperative technology.",Huq S; Kallos JA; Boggs K; Diamond K; Scanlon S; Bin-Alamer O; Rivera D; Pearce TM; Hadjipanayis CG,"Center for Image-Guided Neurosurgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.","Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2025-10-10,10.1227/ons.0000000000001798,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Fluorescence; Glioma; Visualization; Handheld; Aminolevulinic Acid

41074697,The role of enhanced stent visualization imaging in percutaneous coronary intervention: a systematic review of efficacy and clinical outcomes.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is central to its management, and optimal stent deployment is critical. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and clinical outcomes associated with enhanced stent visualization (ESV) systems - x-ray-based fluoroscopic tools such as StentBoost and CLEARstent - in PCI.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search of PubMed, PubMed Central, and Cochrane Library was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria comprised all study types evaluating ESV use in PCI, excluding case reports and non-English articles. Study quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa tool.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve studies involving ESV were included. ESV improved detection of stent expansion and deployment versus standard angiography and showed strong agreement with OCT and IVUS. ESV-guided PCI was associated with reduced rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), particularly in long-term follow-up. Radiation exposure was modestly increased but deemed acceptable.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ESV systems enhance stent deployment accuracy and clinical outcomes in PCI, offering a cost-effective and accessible alternative to OCT and IVUS. Evidence supports routine integration of ESV in PCI workflows, although further large-scale trials are warranted.<h4>Registration</h4>PROSPERO identifier is CRD420251020834.",Sant Bakshsingh V; Bundhoo SS; Protty MB,"Grange University Hospital, Cwmbran, UK.",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,2025-10-11,10.1080/14779072.2025.2574262,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Coronary angiography; Percutaneous coronary intervention; coronary artery disease; Fluoroscopy; Stentboost; Stent Boost; Clearstent; Clear Stent

41072466,A novel 3-dimensional-printed construct provides adequate cranial abdominal visualization for lift laparoscopy in a canine cadaver model.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To create a novel construct for lift laparoscopy in dogs and to determine the maximum lift capacity of the construct and lift force required for maximal cranial abdominal visualization.<h4>Methods</h4>A 3-D-printed ring (3DPR) was designed for a study conducted from December 1, 2023, to January 20, 2024, to articulate with 2 sizes of a commercially available polyurethane wound retractor (PWR). The PWR and 3DPR were attached to a hanging trapeze following insertion into miniature laparotomies on the ventral abdomen. In 8 cadavers, load was applied to the construct to determine its maximum tensile capabilities. In 6 cadavers, laparoscopic images of the diaphragm were attained at different abdominal wall lift forces based on the percentage of body weight. Diaphragmatic visibility was scored, and diaphragmatic surface area was calculated to determine lift force for maximal cranial abdominal visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Visible diaphragmatic surface area was greatest during body wall lifting at 15% body weight (median, 162.56 cm2; IQR, 132.88 to 212.38 cm2) compared to 20% body weight (median, 139.26 cm2; IQR, 105.23 to 155.10 cm2). Median failure force was greater for small (18.01; IQR, 15.51 to 23.00 kilogram-force) versus extra-small (11.65; IQR, 9.63 to 13.00 kilogram-force) 3DPR/PWR constructs. Median failure force for both 3DPR/PWR construct sizes occurred at > 43% of the body weight.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings of this study demonstrate the preclinical feasibility of a novel construct for cranial abdominal lift at low tensile loads in canine cadavers.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>The construct reported here may represent an effective lift laparoscopy alternative to capnoperitoneum for cranial abdominal procedures in dogs at risk of complications during abdominal insufflation.",Lubanski JM; Case JB; Perez TJ; Williams R; Biedrzycki AH; Hanlon J; Solari FP; Bertran J,"Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.",American journal of veterinary research,2025-10-10,10.2460/ajvr.25.06.0224,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",minimally invasive surgery; 3-d Printing; Abdominal Wall Lifting; Polyurethane Wound Retractors; Lift Laparoscopy
41058327,"Sprayable pH-sensitive near-infrared fluorophore for rapid, bright, specific, and safe visualization of human thyroid cancer in orthotopic mouse models.","<h4>Background</h4>Surgery is the primary treatment for thyroid cancer. However, incomplete resection of thyroid cancer can result in local, regional, and distant recurrences that are life threatening. We hypothesized that a topically applied, pH-sensitive near-infrared fluorophore in spray form (PH10) could offer rapid labeling of thyroid tumors, enabling better visualizion of the tumor and its margins.<h4>Methods</h4>Cellar uptake inhibition and cytotoxicity studies using PH10 were performed on TPC-1 papillary and TT medullary thyroid cancer cells. Subcutaneous or orthotopic tumors were established by injecting TPC-1 cells in the flanks or thyroid glands of nude mice, respectively, and sprayed with PH10. Fluorescence of the tumor was compared to surrounding tissues. Tumors were harvested for pathologic analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The organic anion transporter peptide mediated uptake of PH10 in TPC-1 and TT cells was determined. PH10 exhibited an IC50 value of 13.18 and 17.28 μM in TPC-1 and TT cells, respectively. Both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors displayed strong near-infrared fluorescence upon spraying PH10 at a concentration of 10 μM on the tumor sites, within 1 minute, contrasting with surrounding tissues. The effective PH10 dose for tumor visualization was well below the IC50. The average tumor to background ratios were 5.5 (±1.47) for subcutaneous tumors (n = 5) and 9.4 (±2.59) for orthotopic tumors (n = 5). Hematoxylin and eosin staining confirmed the tumor characteristics.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The pH-sensitive near-infrared fluorophore PH10 brightly, rapidly, specifically, and safely labeled thyroid cancer in mouse models by spraying, demonstrating future clinical promise as a useful agent for improved visualization of thyroid cancer.",Jaiswal S; Yamashita A; Lee S; Amirfakhri S; Ser J; Kashiwagi S; Lin G; Hoffman RM; Henary M; Choi HS; Bouvet M,"Department of Surgery, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA; Department of Surgery, VA San Diego Healthcare System, La Jolla, CA.",Surgery,2025-10-06,10.1016/j.surg.2025.109703,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",
41053381,A novel biliary-specific near-infrared fluorescent dye (BL-760) enhances visualization of the biliary tree in a swine inflammatory model of bile duct obstruction.,"<h4>Background</h4>Bile duct injury (BDI) is a morbid complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to poor recognition of the anatomy and inadequate visualization of the extra-hepatic biliary ducts. Near-infrared indocyanine green (ICG) is the most commonly used non-invasive option to assist with identification of the extra-hepatic biliary structures. However ICG is limited by its slow onset of action and lack of specificity for the biliary tree. In light of these limitations our team previously reported bile-label 760 (BL-760), a pre-clinical near-infrared dye, as a novel tool for intraoperative identification of biliary structures. This study builds upon our previous work and assesses the intraoperative detection of the extra-hepatic biliary ducts in a swine model of biliary obstruction using intravenously administered BL-760.<h4>Methods</h4>A survival swine study utilizing BL-760 was performed in two 30 kg female Yorkshire swine. Each swine underwent two surgeries. In the initial surgeries, laparoscopic clipping of an extra-hepatic biliary duct was performed under BL-760 guidance. The cystic duct (CD) was clipped in Swine #1 and the common bile duct (CBD) was clipped in Swine #2. On the third postoperative day, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in each swine under BL-760 guidance. Target-to-background ratios (TBRs) of the extra-hepatic biliary ducts to the liver were measured using ImageJ.<h4>Results</h4>The surgeries were performed without complication. The TBR in the initial surgeries were 2.42 (Swine #1) and 3.22 (Swine #2) for the CBD, without the need for surrounding dissection. In the second surgeries, the gallbladders were clearly inflamed without perforation, and the CBDs were visualized with BL-760 with a TBR of 2.83 (Swine #1) and 2.60 (Swine #2).<h4>Conclusions</h4>BL-760 demonstrates high specificity for the biliary tree in an obstructive biliary model. BL-760's rapid, enhanced visualization has the potential to improve the accuracy of identifying biliary anatomy and enhance cholecystectomy safety.",Halpern AI; Yang KM; Ali KM; Ning B; Schnermann MJ; Sandler AD; Cha RJ,"Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation, Children's National Hospital, 111 Michigan Avenue, Washington, DC, 20010, USA. ahalpern@childrensnational.org.",Surgical endoscopy,2025-10-06,10.1007/s00464-025-12252-9,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Cholecystectomy; Indocyanine green; Bile Duct Injury; Near-infrared Dye; Bl-760
41070937,A Scientometric Analysis of the Global Epidemiology of Childhood Vaccine Hesitancy Among Turkish Parents.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Vaccine hesitancy among parents is a significant threat to global health, contributing to the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

41070841,Leveraging Electronic Health Record Tools and Social Work to Improve Advance Care Planning Documentation in Older Adults With Cancer.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Despite its proven benefits, many older adults with cancer do not engage in advance care planning (ACP). Although ACP is beneficial for all patients, older adults often have different priorities compared with younger patients and have higher rates of cancer-related mortality. A default ACP intervention for older adults could increase completion of ACP documents and promote goal-concordant cancer care.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a quality improvement pilot in a community oncology practice targeting patients age 65 years and older with a documented geriatric assessment. An electronic health record (EHR) dashboard was used to flag patients without ACP documents on file. We implemented a default offer of an ACP-focused social work visit during already-scheduled oncology visits. Any ACP documentation was defined as an advance directive (AD), physician orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST), durable power of attorney, living will, or structured ACP note. The proportion of patients with ACP documents on file was obtained at baseline and 9 months.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 142 patients were included in the analytic cohort. Over 9 months, the proportion of patients with any ACP documents on file increased from 32% to 65%. AD completion increased from 21% to 53%, POLST completion increased from 15% to 31%, and patients with an ACP note on file increased from 17% to 23%. Patients of White race were more likely to have ACP documents on file (<i>P</i> = .006), as were patients with lower performance status (<i>P</i> = .009). There were no significant differences between those who completed ACP documentation and those who did not in terms of age, sex, marital status, cancer diagnosis, or stage.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A social worker-led, EHR-embedded ACP intervention more than doubled ACP documentation. This multidisciplinary approach may represent a scalable strategy to promote goal-concordant care in older adults with cancer.",Reed-Guy L; Ani J; Raghavendran K; Zuber C; Collins M; Kennedy M; Goldman N; Cahill C; Dougherty D; Gabriel P; Singh A; Boisseau L; Sedhom R,"Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.",JCO oncology practice,2025-10-10,10.1200/op-25-00789,5.4,"dashboard(abstract); electronic health record(title,abstract)",
41071450,Evaluation of image quality in pediatric portable chest radiographs using AI-based noise reduction and edge enhancement.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To evaluate the image quality of pediatric portable chest radiographs processed using a deep learning-based noise reduction (NR) algorithm implemented in clinical radiography systems, which is designed to reduce image noise without altering radiation dose, both alone and with edge enhancement.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective visual grading analysis included 101 pediatric patients (median age: 33 days; median weight: 2844 g) who underwent portable chest radiography. Each image was processed using four techniques: (1) standard (no processing), (2) edge enhancement only, (3) NR only, and (4) NR with edge enhancement. Image quality was assessed using five criteria: visualization of proximal bronchi, small peripheral airways, vertebrae, image noise, and overall image quality. In an anonymous, randomized review, two pediatric radiologists rated each criterion using a 5-point Likert scale. Statistical comparisons were conducted between processing methods.<h4>Results</h4>Images processed with NR and edge enhancement (NR + /Filter +) achieved the highest mean scores across all criteria. Structural visibility-particularly of small peripheral airways, proximal bronchi, and vertebrae-showed significant improvement with edge enhancement (p < 0.0001). No significant difference in image noise was observed between NR-only and NR + /Filter + groups (p = 0.482).<h4>Conclusion</h4>AI-based noise reduction significantly improves image quality by reducing noise. Although edge enhancement does not further suppress noise, it improves the visibility of delicate anatomical structures. This combined approach may enhance diagnostic confidence in neonatal chest radiography, particularly under low-dose conditions.",Fujikawa A; Matsuoka S; Saito Y; Arizono S; Nakamura K; Kato A; Tanuma T; Mimura H,"Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki City, Kanagawa, ZIP 216-8511, Japan. a2fujikawa@marianna-u.ac.jp.",Japanese journal of radiology,2025-10-10,10.1007/s11604-025-01887-2,4.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw),Artificial intelligence; Noise Reduction; Image Quality Assessment; Edge Enhancement; Low-dose Imaging; Neonatal Chest Radiography
41075573,Novel staining-microscopy workflow visualizes microfibers in soil-plant systems: Implications for sustainable agriculture and food safety.,"Microfibers (MFs), primarily originating from sewage sludge and laundry effluents, are the most prevalent form of microplastics (MPs) in agricultural soils. While their ecological effects have been explored, the visualization, crop-level accumulation, and potential transport mechanisms of MFs within soil-plant systems remain poorly understood. This study combines 1,3,6,8-pyrene tetrasulfonic acid (PTSA) fluorescent staining with a sequential multimodal microscopy workflow to effectively track the distribution, adsorption, accumulation, and uptake of MFs under realistic soil cultivation conditions. Three edible vegetables-lettuce, Chinese cabbage, and cherry radish-were used to evaluate species-specific response patterns. The results revealed clear differences in MF interactions across species: lettuce exhibited strong MF adsorption on root surfaces and subsequent penetration via crack-entry and apoplastic pathways without entering cells. In contrast, Chinese cabbage and cherry radish showed limited MF adsorption and no uptake. These patterns were associated with root permeability and antioxidative capacities, indicating that plant functional traits play a critical role in determining the transport capacity of MPs. Beyond introducing a novel method for MF visualization in complex terrestrial matrices, this study provides new insights into the risks posed by MFs to soil-plant systems. The findings also highlight potential threats to food safety and underscore the need to establish plant-specific thresholds and pollution mitigation strategies to support sustainable agriculture and protect public health.",Chen Z; Carter LJ; Banwart SA; Roychoudhry S; Pramanik DD; Kay P,"School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, United Kingdom; School of Geography, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, United Kingdom.

41055264,Engineered Magnetic Resonance Nanoprobes for Visualizing Tumor Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 Level and Enhancing Synergistic Radio Immunotherapy.,"Visualizing tumor programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and synchronously using this target for effective tumor therapy present great prospects for clinical application. In this study, a gadolinium-hybridized platinum nanoplatform with dimeric PD-L1-antagonistic affibody (Z<sub>PD-L1</sub>) (GPPZ) was constructed. Leveraging the specific binding between Z<sub>PD-L1</sub> and the tumor surface, Z<sub>PD-L1</sub> could endow this nanoplatform with efficient PD-L1 targeting, enabling the efficient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visualization of PD-L1 expression. GPPZ, through its catalase- and peroxidase-like activities, can catalyze the production of O<sub>2</sub> and the production of •OH, respectively, sensitizing radiotherapy and enhancing immunogenic cell death. In addition, Z<sub>PD-L1</sub> can also terminate T cells' immune suppression by effectively inhibiting interactions of PD-1/PD-L1 to further enhance tumor immunotherapy. Systemic delivery of GPPZ resulted in MRI contrast enhancement of tumors with high levels of PD-L1 expression. Importantly, no obvious side effects can be observed in both histological and hematology examination. Therefore, this nanoplatform demonstrated promise for enhanced MRI visualization of tumor PD-L1 level and synergistic radio immunotherapy.",Sun X; Gong Y; Ge H; Ma G; Yang T; Mu M; Zhang L; Wang C; Shen B; Dai X; Wu Z; Zhang X; Fan Q; Sun H,"Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250117, China.",ACS nano,2025-10-07,10.1021/acsnano.5c04774,4.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract)",MRI; Nanoprobes; Ferroptosis; Radio-immunotherapy; Dimeric Pd-l1 Affibody
41073438,Integrative functional genomics analysis of Kaposi sarcoma cohorts.,"Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an AIDS-defining cancer and a significant global health challenge caused by KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). NGS-based approaches have profiled KS lesions in a minimal number of studies compared with other neoplastic diseases. Here we present a compiled and harmonized dataset of 131 KS and non-tumor cutaneous samples in the context of their predicted pathway activities, immune infiltrate, KSHV and HIV gene expression profiles, and their associated clinical data representing patient populations from Argentina, United States (USA), and Sub-Saharan Africa cohorts. RNA-seq data from 9 Argentinian KS lesions were generated and integrated with previously published datasets derived from the USA and sub-Saharan African cohorts from Tanzania, Zambia, and Uganda. An unsupervised analysis of 131 KS-related samples allowed us to identify four KS clusters based on their host and KSHV gene expression profiles, immune infiltrate, and the activity of specific signaling pathways. The compiled RNA-seq profile is shared with the research community through the UCSC Xena browser for further visualization, download, and analysis ( https://kaposi.xenahubs.net/ ).

41062104,Clinical application of anterior segment optical coherence tomography in ocular emergencies: A comprehensive review.,"This narrative review explored the comprehensive clinical applications of anterior segment optical coherence tomography in cases of ocular trauma and emergencies, with a focus on its diagnostic, therapeutic, and future implications. A literature search was conducted via PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using relevant keywords, yielding 86 articles for inclusion. However, no formal systemic review or meta-analysis was performed. These studies highlight the role of anterior segment optical coherence tomography as a high-resolution, noncontact imaging modality that enables detailed assessment of anterior segment injuries, even in cases with compromised visualization due to corneal opacity or hyphema. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography facilitates accurate diagnosis of corneal lacerations, intraocular foreign bodies, traumatic cataracts, and angle abnormalities, contributing significantly to surgical planning. Moreover, anterior segment optical coherence tomography angiography provides novel insights into anterior segment vasculature; for instance, it helps detect limbal ischemia in chemical injuries. Despite its numerous benefits, anterior segment optical coherence tomography is limited by its inability to image structures posterior to the iris and its reliance on patient cooperation for accurate imaging. Overall, anterior segment optical coherence tomography has transformed the evaluation and management of ocular emergencies by enhancing structural visualization and improving clinical decision-making. Future innovations, including enhanced penetration depth and integration of artificial intelligence, are expected to further expand its diagnostic and therapeutic potential.",Asadigandomani H; Momeni A; Nusair O; Daneshvar K; Esmaeilkhanian H; Ghochani G; Ahmadi P; Razavi A; Esfandiari H; Soleimani M,"Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Francisco, USA.",The Journal of international medical research,2025-10-08,10.1177/03000605251382298,3.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract),Traumatic cataract; Foreign Body; Ocular Trauma; Infectious Keratitis; Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography; Corneal Laceration

41069141,Effect of Mobile Augmented Reality Counseling on Improving Shared Decision-Making in Thoracic Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Crossover Trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>Augmented reality (AR) superimposes virtual objects onto the real-world environment, allowing users to interact in real-time. Since AR has become widely used, it also leverages the efficiency advantages of smartphones or tablets to enable mobile augmented reality (MAR) experiences. AR has been adopted in many industries, and literature has highlighted its applications in academic and clinical settings, particularly for enhancing visualization, communication, and learning.<h4>Objective</h4>This study investigates the potential of mobile augmented reality as mHealth tools to enhance shared decision-making (SDM) in thoracic surgery by increasing patient understanding and engagement during medical consultations.<h4>Methods</h4>A randomized crossover clinical trial was conducted at Tri-Service General Hospital in Taiwan. Participants scheduled for thoracic surgery were enrolled and randomized in a crossover design. The MAR intervention incorporated patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) anatomical models that were reconstructed from CT imaging to facilitate understanding and support SDM. The impact of each counseling approach on SDM was evaluated using post-intervention questionnaires.<h4>Results</h4>A total of forty-seven participants were effectively incorporated into the research. After analyzing the data, we found that patients in the MAR group showed significantly higher scores compared to those in the traditional counseling group (p < 0.05) during the SDM process. Moreover, patients reported higher satisfaction levels and found the visual objects helpful in understanding tumor location and surgical procedures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study demonstrates that MAR counseling significantly enhances patients' comprehension of thoracic conditions and increases their active engagement in the SDM process. The integration of patient-specific 3D anatomical models into MAR technology provided an intuitive method for critical medical information. This digital approach not only enhances personalization in medical communication but also reinforces patient education in their own healthcare conditions. The findings suggest that MAR counseling represents a promising approach for promoting patient-centered care in thoracic surgery and has potential applications across various clinical domains.<h4>Clinicaltrial</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT07062393. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07062393.",Chen YS; Hsu YC; Romalee W; Wang DH; Lai J; Huang TW; Lin KH,"Surgery, Tri-Service General Hospital, School of Medicine, National Defense Medical University, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, TW.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2025-10-09,10.2196/79632,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

41060350,"Transabdominal ultrasound for positive, negative, and equivocal ovarian and tubal torsion in girls.","<h4>Background</h4>Adnexal torsion diagnosis in children relies heavily on ultrasound, but existing literature lacks standardization of technique and handling of equivocal results.<h4>Purpose</h4>To assess the accuracy of transabdominal ultrasound (US) in diagnosing adnexal torsion in pediatric patients and evaluate optimal clinical decision-making for equivocal US reads.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Retrospective review of pelvic US exams and surgical data for girls aged 1-18 years from 2015 to 2019 at a pediatric quaternary care hospital. US reports were coded as positive, negative, or equivocal for torsion. Surgical findings were used to confirm final diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated under various scenarios for handling equivocal reads.<h4>Results</h4>This study included 4,396 ultrasound exams from 3,707 patients (median age, 15.2 years [IQR: 12.8-16.8]). Ovarian visualization rate was 97-98%. US was read as positive for torsion in 1% of adnexae, negative in 95%, and equivocal in 4%. Among 179 surgical cases, torsion was present in 52%. Sensitivity of US for torsion was highest (86.0%) when equivocal cases were considered positive (EqP), but PPV was lowest (29.9%) under this condition. Area under the ROC curve was greatest (0.8651) when equivocal US were counted as positive. US reads were more likely to be true positive for isolated ovarian torsion compared to when tubal torsion was present (p = 0.003).<h4>Conclusion</h4>A standardized transabdominal US protocol yields high ovarian visualization rates, and treating equivocal reads as positive can optimize diagnostic accuracy when combined with clinical decision-making. US maybe be less accurate in detecting tubal torsion compared to isolated ovarian torsion, but this finding should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size.

41056248,The rising burden of female cancer in Ethiopia (2000-2021) and projections to 2040: Insights from the global burden of disease study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Female cancers-breast, cervical, ovarian, and uterine-pose significant public health and socio-economic challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Ethiopia. However, detailed and geographically disaggregated data are limited, hindering effective policymaking. To address this gap, our study utilizes the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) methodology to analyze 21 years (2000-2021) of national and sub-national trends and risk factors for these cancers in Ethiopia, with projections to 2040, to support targeted cancer control and health system strengthening.<h4>Methods</h4>Using the 2021GBD data, we analyzed the national and sub-national prevalence, incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) for female specific cancer in Ethiopia. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was employed for projecting epidemiological trajectories through 2040. All statistical analyses and data visualization were performed using Python.<h4>Results</h4>In 2021, the Ethiopian incidence of female breast, cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancer was 7,308 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 5,794-9,199), 7,884 (95% UI: 5,759-11,765), 2,054 (95% UI: 1,034-2,929), and 669 (95% UI: 422-1,126), respectively. Cervical cancer accounts for the highest number of DALYs, 162,776 (95% UI: 119,900-239,116), followed by breast, ovarian, and uterine cancer at 155,931 (95% UI: 123,015-196,249), 40,430 (95% UI: 19,885-57,414), and 8,882 (95% UI: 5,579-15,240), respectively. Projections to 2040 indicate a continued rise in incidence for all female cancers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Breast and ovarian cancers are emerging public health crises in Ethiopia, with significant increases in prevalence, incidence, and DALYs. While the cervical cancer burden is declining, rising YLDs indicate a growing need for long-term care. The projected rise in female cancer incidence calls for urgent, targeted interventions focused on early diagnosis, age-appropriate screening, and improved cancer care services to reduce the adverse impact on Ethiopian women's health.",Adisu MA; Habtie TE; Kitaw TA; Gessesse AD; Woreta BM; Derso YA; Zemariam AB,"Department of Pediatrics and child health Nursing, College of Health science, Woldia University, Woldia, Ethiopia.",PloS one,2025-10-07,10.1371/journal.pone.0333787,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41061915,Four-dimensional (4D) virtual simulation for predicting soft tissue support and vertical dimension of occlusion in full-arch implant therapy - A proof of concept.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To describe a proof-of-concept digital workflow for four-dimensional (4D) virtual simulation of facial soft tissue support in edentulous patients, based on a real clinical case.<h4>Methods</h4>A non-invasive digital workflow was developed using intraoral, extraoral, and laboratory scans. These datasets were merged into a simulation three-dimensional (3D) model using finite element methods. Skeletal structures were represented by surface meshes, and soft tissues by volumetric tetrahedral elements. Simulations predicted changes in lip support, occlusal vertical dimension, and facial esthetics. The workflow required no additional radiographic imaging and utilized standard clinical scanning tools.<h4>Results</h4>The technique was demonstrated on a fully edentulous patient and proved clinically feasible. Accurate alignment of intraoral and facial scans enabled dynamic visualization of soft tissue changes, supporting both fixed and removable prosthetic scenarios. The patient could preview functional and esthetic outcomes before treatment initiation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This approach improves treatment predictability, supports interdisciplinary collaboration, and reduces reliance on conventional methods. It enhances personalized prosthodontic planning, streamlines communication between clinician, technician, and patient, and shortens chairside time-aligning with the growing demand for patient-centered care.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using 4D virtual simulation to visualize soft tissue changes in edentulous patients before treatment.

41065616,Photon-Counting Computed Tomography in Cardiac Imaging.,"Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. However, conventional CT technologies are limited by spatial resolution, artifact susceptibility, and radiation exposure. Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) introduces substantial technological improvements over conventional CT. This includes improved spatial and contrast resolution, energy discrimination, and reduction of various artifacts. As a result, PCCT enables superior coronary lumen and plaque evaluation, even in complex cases with severe calcification or smaller coronary stents. Beyond the coronary arteries, PCCT offers improved visualization of cardiac anatomy and myocardial tissue characterization with the potential to reduce downstream testing, improve diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes. PCCT is poised to become the dominant technology for cardiovascular CT; however, challenges such as high costs, increased data demands, and a need for more validation, standardized image acquisition, and post-processing protocols remain. This review explores the technical principles of PCCT, its advantages over conventional CT, and its current and potential future applications in cardiac imaging, highlighting opportunities for future research.",Shiyovich A; Singh A; Blair CV; Cardoso R; Huck D; Peng G; Shaw LJ; Leipsic JA; Gräni C; Antoniades C; Maurovich-Horvat P; Williamson EE; Cademartiri F; Achenbach S; Blankstein R,"Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.",JACC.

41057755,A retrospective analysis of the effects of moderate sedation on the degree of cardia exposure in overweight elderly patients.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gastric cancer is a type of malignant gastrointestinal tumor that poses a serious threat to human life and ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Although cardia-related diseases are rarely reported in the literature on gastrointestinal disorders, cardia lesions are not uncommon in clinical practice. The development of esophageal cancer may be associated with risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma, such as reflux esophagitis, high-fat diet, advanced age, and obesity. During gastroscopy, it is important to note that inadequate visualization of the esophagus may result from various factors, which can affect the diagnosis of esophageal lesions and lead to misdiagnosis or missed diagnoses. Currently, intravenous sedation using a combination of fentanyl and propofol is routinely administered during gastrointestinal endoscopy. The use of propofol in gastroscopy has been shown to improve procedural quality, enhance patient tolerance, and increase the accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis. However, the differences in esophageal exposure between moderate and deep sedation still require further clinical validation.<h4>Methods</h4>This study was a single-center retrospective clinical study. One hundred and twenty elderly overweight patients who underwent sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at our Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Center from May 2020 to August 2023 were retrospectively collected and divided into a moderate sedation group (Group A) and a deep sedation group (Group B) according to the anesthesia method. Primary outcome index: compare the sedation success rate and cardia exposure degree between the two groups. Secondary outcome indicators: compare the incidence of hypoxia during sedation between the two groups. Comparison of sedation recovery time, pain [visual analog scale (VAS)] and patient satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 120 patients aged 60-75 years with body mass index ≧ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were enrolled. The general data of the patients in the two groups were comparable (P > 0.05).The sedation success rate was comparable in Groups A and B (94.83% vs. 96.78%, P = 0.594).The degrees of cardia exposure in group A and group B were compared. The degrees of cardia exposure in Group A with scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 12 cases (20.69%), 13 cases (22.41%), 19 cases (32.76%), and 14 cases (24.14%), respectively. The degrees of cardia exposure in group B were 21 cases (33.87%), 19 cases (30.65%), 18 cases (29.03%), and 4 cases (6.45%), respectively. Compared with group B, group A had a higher degree of cardia exposure, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.029). The total perioperative adverse reactions were relatively lower in group A compared with group B, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.049).The incidence of hypoxia (2%vs11%) and sedation recovery time (10.08 ± 2.18vs.15.38 ± 3.25) were significantly smaller in group A than in group B, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05).The satisfaction with endoscopy was higher in both groups ( 98.28%vs.96.78%, P = 1.000), the difference was not statistically significant.The exposure of the cardia during gastroscopy was not significantly associated with patient gender, comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), or gastric or bile reflux, but was significantly associated with the depth of anesthesia (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Both moderate and deep sedation are applicable for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in elderly overweight patients. However, moderate sedation is more suitable than deep sedation for those with unstable cardiopulmonary function. Compared with deep sedation, moderate sedation provides better cardia exposure, a lower incidence of hypoxia, faster recovery time, improved safety, and comparable patient satisfaction, making it worthy of clinical promotion.",Qi L; Zhou Z; Peng K; Yu N; Wang L; Ji X; Zhang Y,"Department of Anesthesiology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong Province, 266061, China.",BMC anesthesiology,2025-10-07,10.1186/s12871-025-03387-2,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Elderly; Propofol; Overweight; Deep Sedation; sufentanil; Moderate Sedation; Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy; Cardia Exposure

41073793,Postoperative assessment of fracture reduction and osteosynthesis materials using photon-counting detector CT in maxillofacial trauma - a pilot study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To assess postoperative fracture reduction and visualization of titanium-based and bioresorbable osteosynthesis materials in maxillofacial trauma surgery using ultra-high-resolution photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) compared with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).<h4>Methods</h4>Fractures were induced in six cadaveric pig mandibles at the angle, body, and parasymphysis and were stabilized using various titanium and bioresorbable plate systems. Specimens were scanned with CBCT and dose-matched PCD-CT in the ultra-high resolution mode, applying standard and low-dose protocols. Two observers assessed fracture reduction and implant delineation using a 5-point visual analog scale. Fracture gap and osteosynthesis materials were quantitatively measured and compared to ground-truth values. Descriptive statistics and inter-reader agreement (weighted κ) were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>PCD-CT enabled excellent assessment of fracture reduction and visualization of osteosynthesis materials, with perfect inter-observer agreement (Median = 5, IQR, 5-5; κ = 1.0, p < 0.001), whereas low-dose CBCT showed reduced image quality and lower reproducibility (Median = 4, IQR, 4-4; κ = 0.92; p < 0.001). Bioresorbable plates were not directly visible using either scanner, but the associated screw drill holes were reliably delineated. PCD-CT achieved the smallest measurement deviations of fracture gap and osteosynthesis materials compared with ground truth, and with superior reproducibility (κ = 0.74-0.84; ICC = 0.95-0.99; all p < 0.001), outperforming CBCT across most parameters.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ultra-high resolution PCD-CT combines superior visualization and precise measurements compared with CBCT even at low radiation dose. With further clinical validation, these findings highlight PCD-CT's strong potential for perioperative imaging in maxillofacial trauma, particularly benefiting younger patients who require repeated scans.",Al-Haj Husain A; Mergen V; Sandhu S; Wagner MEH; Demmert TT; Alkadhi H; Burian E; Flohr T; Stadlinger B; Kessler P; Lie SAN; Essig H,"Department of Cranio-Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Rämistrasse 100, Zurich, 8091, Switzerland. adib.al-hajhusain@usz.ch.",Oral and maxillofacial surgery,2025-10-11,10.1007/s10006-025-01470-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Fractures; Surgical procedure; Maxillofacial Surgery; Photon-counting Detector Computed Tomography; Cone-beam Computed tomography
41052938,Advantages of 12° Endoscope in Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic Surgery for Lumbar Disc Herniation.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study introduces the application of a 12° endoscope in unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) decompression surgery for lumbar disc herniation and discusses its advantages in UBE procedures.<h4>Methods</h4>From December 2019 to December 2020, 75 patients (33 men and 42 women) were treated with UBE decompression using a 12° endoscope. Patient ages ranged from 26 to 78 years (mean 53.2). Pre- and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for low back and leg pain were recorded. Surgical outcomes were evaluated using MacNab criteria, with operative time and complications documented.<h4>Results</h4>The 12° endoscope demonstrated superior maneuverability with a distortion-free visual field. Compared with 30° endoscopes, it showed better applicability within the anatomical working triangle while providing broader visualization than 0° endoscopes. This enabled effective decompression of the superior articular process medial edge, nerve root canal, and lateral recess. Low back pain VAS scores decreased from 7.3 ± 1.3 to 1.9 ± 1.2 (<i>P</i> < 0.001), while leg pain scores improved from 8.1 ± 1.8 to 1.6 ± 1.0 (<i>P</i> < 0.001). At the 12-month follow-up, MacNab criteria outcomes were excellent in 65.3%, good in 25.3%, and unsatisfactory in 9.3% of cases (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> test, <i>P</i> = 0.002).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The 12° endoscope demonstrates clinical value as a feasible, safe, and effective option for UBE surgery in lumbar disc herniation treatment.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Key clinical advantages of the 12° endoscope include direct visualization of key anatomical structures, minimized bone resection (particularly at the medial spinous process base), and a reduction in instrument crowding. These technical benefits contribute to effective decompression, improved patient outcomes (as measured by VAS and MacNab criteria), and potentially a shorter learning curve for surgeons adopting the UBE technique.<h4>Level of evidence: 3</h4>",Wu W; Xie Y; Xue Y; Cui M; Zeng X; Zhang Y; Yang C; Wu Y,"Department of Orthopedics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",International journal of spine surgery,2025-10-06,10.14444/8771,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Lumbar disc herniation; Minimally Invasive Spinal Surgery; Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy; 12° Endoscope
41056268,Networks for treatment selection in psychotherapy: providing a manual for process-based perceived causal networks.,"Idiographic networks offer a transdiagnostic approach to case conceptualization and may aid in selecting the treatment focus. We provide a practical manual for constructing idiographic paper-pencil networks. These networks focus on a single main problem, delineate the maladaptive processes that perpetuate it, and thereby inform treatment recommendations. We tested the feasibility and clinical utility of the network construction. Eight therapists applied a manual to construct idiographic paper-pencil networks with twelve patients. Both therapists and patients assessed the feasibility of the manual, the clarity of the network visualization, and the perceived clinical utility of the networks. Additionally, they evaluated changes in common therapeutic factors due to network construction. Therapists and patients rated the manual as highly feasible, viewed the network visualizations favorably, and assessed the clinical utility of the networks positively. Both therapists and patients reported improvements in treatment expectations, therapeutic alliance, and therapy motivation due to network construction. This study provides a manual for developing idiographic process-based networks during the initial psychotherapy session. Both therapists and patients evaluated the manual and the resulting networks positively, suggesting their potential to enhance case conceptualization and treatment selections in psychotherapy.",Seewald A; Schummer SE; Franz S; Franz M; Rief W,"Department of Psychology, Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy, University of Marburg, Gutenbergstr. 18, Marburg 35032, Germany.",Cognitive behaviour therapy,2025-10-07,10.1080/16506073.2025.2568000,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Feasibility; Network Theory; Common Factors; Personalized Treatment; Pecan; Perceived Causal Network
41067421,Comparative Evaluation of Photon-Counting Detector CT and Cone-Beam CT in the Assessment of Simulated Mandibular Trauma.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>This ex vivo study aimed to compare photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) at matched standard- and low-dose radiation levels for evaluating perioperative imaging parameters relevant to mandibular fracture stabilization with osteosynthesis plates.<h4>Material and methods</h4>Thirty-three osteosynthesis fixations were performed on six porcine mandibles with simulated fractures in the angle, body, and parasymphysis regions. Three types of plate systems (titanium microplates, titanium reconstruction plates, and bioresorbable copolymers) were used, each with varying plate thicknesses. Three blinded observers independently evaluated overall image quality, artifact severity, fracture line visibility, and visualization of peri-osteosynthesis structures using 5-point visual analog scales. Descriptive statistics and inter-reader agreement (Krippendorff's alpha) were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>PCD-CT consistently demonstrated superior overall image quality, reduced artifact severity, and better visualization of fracture lines and peri-osteosynthetic structures compared to CBCT, particularly using low-dose settings. Bioresorbable plates caused no artifacts in either modality. Inter-observer agreement was good to excellent across all parameters (Krippendorff's α = 0.72-1.0).<h4>Conclusion</h4>PCD-CT outperformed CBCT in visualizing mandibular fracture stabilization with various osteosynthesis materials, particularly under low-dose conditions, demonstrating high reliability among observers. These findings indicate that PCD-CT may offer diagnostic advantages in the perioperative setting; however, further clinical studies are needed to confirm its role in imaging oral and maxillofacial trauma.",Sandhu S; Husain AA; Mergen V; Demmert TT; Alkadhi H; Flohr T; Burian E; Stadlinger B; Kessler P; Essig H; Wagner MEH,"Department of Cranio-Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

However, traditional methods remain limited by low sensitivity and the precise quantification remains a challenge. A dual-mode microfluidic analysis chip was constructed here that included clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas12a quantification and immunofluorescence visualization. Quantification of the PD-L1 protein on the surface of CTCs (20 to 10<sup>7</sup> cell/mL) was achieved selectively and sensitively by amplifying the nucleic acid target to generate a strong fluorescent signal, even with very low levels of target cells.

41076352,"A low-cost, easy-to-implement optical add-on to convert a retinal OCT into a ultra-high-resolution corneal OCT.","<h4>Purpose</h4>Commercial anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems typically offer sufficient axial resolution to distinguish corneal layers. However, their lateral resolution (∼15-20 µm) is limited, restricting the visualization of fine microstructural features, relevant for noninvasive diagnosis of corneal pathologies. We present a low-cost, easy-to-implement optical add-on that substantially improves the lateral resolution of a standard retinal OCT system, enabling high-fidelity corneal imaging.<h4>Methods</h4>Custom-designed optical modules were developed for the standard objective lens of an investigational retinal OCT device. The system design, incorporating a single achromatic lens, was optimized through optical simulations to achieve a higher numerical aperture and reduced focal length. The lateral resolution was evaluated both theoretically, via point spread function, and experimentally using a 1951 United States Air Force (USAF) resolution target. A compact prototype, presented here, was tested on a commercial SPECTRALIS OCT2, compared with the commercial Anterior Segment Module (both Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), and tested in vivo on two human subjects, including one with suspected epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD).<h4>Results</h4>The prototype achieved a lateral resolution of 3.1µm in the experiment, closely matching the results of the optical simulation. This resolution is markedly better than the 15.6µm achieved with the commercial corneal OCT, albeit at a cost of a reduced field of view (2.62mm vs. 8.29mm). In vivo imaging confirmed enhanced visualization of epithelial microstructures in both healthy and pathological corneas, despite a reduced depth of focus resulting from the higher numerical aperture.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed add-on enabled ultra-high-resolution corneal imaging on a standard SPECTRALIS OCT2 platform without the need for major hardware modifications, such as an increased reference arm or dispersion compensation. This low-cost, easy-to-implement approach offers diagnostic value for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of subtle corneal irregularities, particularly in conditions such as EBMD, where a high lateral resolution is critical for clinical decision-making.",Stange F; Bohn S; Gottschlich A; Korn T; Stachs O; Sperlich K,"Department of Ophthalmology, Rostock University Medical Center, 18057 Rostock, Germany; Institute of Physics, University of Rostock 18059 Rostock, Germany.",Zeitschrift fur medizinische Physik,2025-10-10,10.1016/j.zemedi.2025.09.004,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cornea; High-resolution; Oct; Anterior Segment; Ebmd

However, effective visualization of HCC-related molecular changes requires advanced nanoscale contrast agents with surface modifications for specific biomarker binding. Iron-platinum nanoparticles (FePt NPs) are widely used for <i>T</i>2-weighted MRI contrast but are rapidly degraded by macrophages, limiting their accumulation and signal enhancement <i>in vivo</i>. To address this issue, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can encapsulate FePt NPs to improve stability and imaging contrast. Additionally, red blood cell membrane (RBC-m) coating enhances tumor tissue accumulation, enabling real-time tracking and diagnosis of HCC. Initial studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this technology in HCC imaging diagnosis, contributing to disease monitoring and treatment evaluation.

41073423,The role of self-esteem between perceived social support and positive Psycap in middle school students based on network analysis and mediation model.,"Positive psycap refers to the individual's psychological state and psychological quality, which plays a vital role in the individual growth and development. This paper uses network analysis and a mediation model to explore the relationship among middle school students' perceived social support, self-esteem, and positive psycap from the perspective of internal and external network structures and mechanisms. In this study, 736 middle school students (350 males) from two middle schools in Hebei Province participated in questionnaire surveys. The results revealed a positive correlation among three variables, especially with a moderately positive correlation between self-esteem and positive psycap scores.​ Network visualization analysis identified key nodes and edges, such as PSSS9, SE10, PPQ5, and PPQ19, as well as strong connections between PSSS3-PSSS9, SE9-SE10, and PPQ5-PPQ19. Stability and accuracy analyses confirmed the reliability of the centrality indices, and the resampling results were highly consistent with the sample.​ Furthermore, the mediation analysis indicated that perceived social support positively predicts positive psycap, and it also positively predicts self-esteem. And self-esteem can positively predict positive psycap. Perceived social support has a significant indirect effect on positive psycap through the mediating role of self-esteem, accounting for 32.4% of the total effect. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying adolescents' psychological health. By fostering their perceived social support and self-esteem, their positive psychological qualities can be promoted, which is crucial for their growth and development.",Chen L; Li Y; Lu X; Miao Q; Zheng Z,"School of Psychology, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China.",Scientific reports,2025-10-10,10.1038/s41598-025-19279-x,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Self-esteem; Network Analysis; Perceived Social Support; Mediation Model; Positive Psycap
41068454,"Moyamoya disease: epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.","Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries and the development of compensatory, fragile collateral vascular networks at the skull. Emerging evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of MMD involves genetic/epigenetic predisposition, dysregulated immune responses, and environmental triggers. Notably, the RNF213 p.R4810K variant has been identified as a key genetic susceptibility factor, particularly in East Asian populations. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression remain incompletely elucidated, primarily due to the limited availability of patient-derived cerebrovascular tissues and the lack of animal models that faithfully recapitulate the full spectrum of human MMD pathology. These constraints have impeded the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Diagnostically, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) continues to serve as the gold standard for diagnosing MMD, enabling detailed visualization of steno-occlusive lesions and characteristic moyamoya vessels. Current clinical management relies predominantly on surgical revascularization to enhance cerebral perfusion, yet this strategy does not alter the fundamental disease process. Recent advances in patient-derived vascular organoids and serum-stimulated cellular models have facilitated drug screening and biomarker identification. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and genetic landscape of MMD, with a focus on recent progress in deciphering its molecular basis. We further discuss the transformative potential of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, particularly when combined with CRISPR-based gene editing, for modeling MMD vasculopathy, investigating the functional impact of RNF213 mutations, and exploring precision repair approaches. These innovative approaches offer novel insights into disease mechanisms and open new avenues for therapeutic intervention in MMD.",Cheng X; Cao Y; Duan J; Zhou M; Ye S; Zhu Y,"Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Science, Anhui University, Hefei, 230601, China.",Molecular biomedicine,2025-10-10,10.1186/s43556-025-00318-y,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Gene Editing; Rnf213; Ipsc-based Cell Therapy; Moyamoya Disease (Mmd)
41076493,Surgical Process Modeling of Workflow and Performance in Image-Guided Bronchoscopy.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Emerging technologies to improve transbronchial sampling of lung lesions include mobile C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) and robotic assistance. Surgical Process Modeling (SPM) was used to quantify performance in such procedures performed using a conventional bronchoscope with guidance via 2D fluoroscopy and radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS) (""Conventional Bronchoscopy"") compared to robot-assisted bronchoscopy with CBCT guidance (""CBCT-Guided RAB"").<h4>Method</h4>Statistical SPMs were implemented for Conventional Bronchoscopy and CBCT-Guided RAB for simulation and analysis of procedural outcomes, including cycle time, radiation dose, and geometric accuracy. The SPMs were parameterized and validated with respect to clinical observation, published literature, and expert input. 9000 simulation runs were computed for each method, analyzing differences in performance and evaluating the influence of body mass index (BMI), lesion location (upper, middle, or lower lobe), and lesion size.<h4>Results</h4>The SPMs exhibited reasonable agreement with retrospective clinical evaluation of cycle time and dose, and variations in geometric accuracy were consistent with clinical literature. CBCT-Guided RAB resulted in a 14% increase in median cycle time (45.3 min) compared to Conventional Bronchoscopy (39.6 min) and increased median dose to the patient by 3.2 × (41.6 Gy cm<sup>2</sup> compared to 12.9 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>). Geometric targeting improved with CBCT-Guided RAB, reducing the rate of geometric miss from 22% under Conventional Bronchoscopy to 2%. 3D visualization of individual runs gave clear depiction of median and outlier performance and a basis for communicating and standardizing complex workflows.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SPMs yielded quantitative performance comparison in lung lesion biopsy by conventional and robot-assisted bronchoscopy. The approach quantified increases in cycle time and dose for CBCT-Guided RAB, accompanied by substantial gains in geometric accuracy. Such modeling provided valuable insight on the benefits of emerging technologies at early stages of implementation and a means to optimize and standardize clinical workflow.",Rypinski TA; Casal RF; Pillai PS; Deva A; Soni B; Sarwar O; Milhorn AC; Jones AK; Chintalapani G; Kleinszig G; Ost DE; Grosu HB; Siewerdsen JH,"Department of Imaging Physics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.",Annals of biomedical engineering,2025-10-11,10.1007/s10439-025-03861-5,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Optimization; Bronchoscopy; Image Guidance; Implementation Science; Surgical Process Model
41061402,Laparoscopic management of sealed gastric perforation caused by an ingested foreign body: A case report.,"<h4>Introduction and importance</h4>Foreign body ingestion is common in prison, psychiatric, and pediatric populations. While most cases resolve without intervention, about 20 % require endoscopic or surgical removal. Perforation, occurring in 1 % of cases, is a serious complication that may spontaneously seal. We report a case of spontaneously sealed gastric perforation managed laparoscopically, emphasizing diagnostic challenges and the potential irrelevance of localizing and repairing such perforations.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 38-year-old male presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and fever for two days. Computed Tomography (CT) revealed a foreign body causing a sealed gastric perforation with an associated abscess. Endoscopic retrieval failed due to non-visualization of the foreign body within the lumen, necessitating laparoscopic removal. Intraoperatively, dense adhesions between the stomach, omentum, and liver capsule suggested that the perforation had sealed spontaneously, making localization of the defect difficult. The foreign body was retrieved, and surrounding collections were drained. Given the dense adhesions, no attempt was made to identify or repair the perforation site, which was presumed sealed. The patient recovered uneventfully and regained full functional capacity within three weeks.<h4>Clinical discussion</h4>Foreign body ingestion is often asymptomatic but can result in peritonitis, obstruction, abscess, or hemorrhage. Diagnosis is challenging and typically requires CT due to the low sensitivity of X-rays. Management depends on clinical severity, with endoscopy preferred initially and surgery for complicated cases. Spontaneous perforation closure is common and may not require localization or repair if the defect is not clearly visible.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Repair may be unnecessary if sealed gastric perforation is adequately drained and the foreign body removed laparoscopically.",Mishra A; Jena SS; Yadav A; Nundy S,"Institute of Surgical Gastroenterology, GI and HPB Onco-Surgery and Liver Transplantation, India.

41048052,Excitation-Matchable Shortwave Infrared Quinolinium Fluorophores: Decoding Spatiotemporal Interactions with Multiplexed Bioimaging.,"Shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000-2000 nm) imaging has emerged as an ideal window for multiplexed imaging at the mammalian level. However, this technology remains largely limited by the lack of a highly tunable ""molecular scaffold core"", which allows for the SWIR dye library to simultaneously meet high brightness, minimal cross-talk, and laser-compatible absorption. Herein, we introduce a diversified quinolinium-based ""scaffold core"" for the generation of the SWIR dye library, allowing excitation-matchable multiplexed imaging for decoding spatiotemporal interactions. This quinolinium domain enables establishing a series of SWIR heptamethine cyanines spanning maximum absorption wavelengths from 975 to 1046 nm. Among them, QC7-NEt<sub>2</sub> and QC7-CN exhibit high brightness and orthogonal excitation at 980 or 1064 nm, matching well the accessible lasers. Using the orthogonal dye pair, we are able to conduct two- and even three-channel excitation-matchable multiplexed imaging with minimal cross-talk for decoding spatiotemporal interactions. These dyes demonstrated dynamic, high-resolution visualization of vasculature, lymph, and intestinal systems, especially for studying the interaction between deep-tissue organs and the surrounding vasculature networks.

Nuclear medicine diagnostic technology has important clinical value for early detection, precise localization and evaluation of treatment effects. To reduce the cost, improve the effectiveness, and increase the scope of use of SPECT radiotracers, a ligand containing cyclohexane as a linker was synthesized, and four <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled FAP inhibitor complexes with different coligands were prepared ([<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-(tricine/TPPTS)-L, [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-(tricine/TPPMS)-L, [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-(tricine/PDA)-L, and [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-(tricine/NIC)-L). <i>In vitro</i> cell experiments revealed that the four complexes specifically bound to cells, and the binding was related to the uptake pathway of FAP; among them, [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]Tc-(tricine/TPPTS)-L showed the best specific uptake.

41068176,Transmission dynamics of mumps epidemic model through stochastic analysis with delay effect.,"Stochastic delayed modeling (stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with delay parameters) has a significant non-pharmaceutical intervention to control transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and its results are close to the reality of nature. Mumps is a viral disease specified with swollen jaws and inflated cheeks. Direct contact with saliva or respiratory drop less from the mouth is the major causes of its outbreak. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), still, 20% of young adult males develop mumps worldwide. No doubt, the vaccination of Mumps exists. The main cause is to study the transmission dynamics of Mumps through stochastic with delay approaches. How is the stochastic delay the best strategy to study the dynamics of disease in a population? For this, we consider the existing deterministic model in literature, with the whole population, divided as susceptible human population S(t), exposed human population E(t), symptomatic infectious I(t), asymptomatic infectious A(t), isolated and treated symptomatic Q(t), recovered humans R(t). After that, we extend the deterministic model into a stochastic delay model (Stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) by using the transition probabilities and non-parametric perturbation ways. The positivity, boundedness, extinction, and persistence of disease study with essential properties of reproduction number rigorously. The mump-free equilibrium (MFE) and mumps existing equilibrium (MEE) are two states, local, and global stability of second order and sensitivity analysis of parameters analyzed to verify the model validations. Due to the highly nonlinear stochastic delay differential equations of the model, we used both standard and nonstandard methods such as Euler Maryama, stochastic Euler, stochastic Runge-Kutta, and stochastic nonstandard finite difference with a delayed sense to visualization of results.

41060759,Transpupillary in vivo two-photon imaging reveals enhanced surveillance of retinal microglia in diabetic mice.,"The retina, located outside the cranium, serves as an ideal structure for investigating information processing within the central nervous system due to its well-organized neurovascular unit comprising diverse cell types, including neurons, glial cells (such as microglia, Müller glia, and astrocytes), pericytes, and vascular endothelial cells. Disrupted retinal homeostasis contributes to various ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinitis pigmentosa. However, noninvasive in vivo imaging methods to study the pathogenesis of these disorders remain limited. Here, we developed a two-photon microscopy technique for real-time, transpupillary in vivo visualization of the retinal neurovascular unit in mice. Our approach integrates systematic head fixation, a custom-made polymethyl methacrylate contact lens, and a glycerin immersion objective lens with an extended working distance and a higher numerical aperture, specifically designed for two-photon microscopy. This method enabled us to visualize dynamic microglial process activity around retinal blood vessels. Our results revealed that retinal microglia exhibit enhanced surveillance under diabetic conditions, which is undetectable by static confocal microscopy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist commonly used for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, reversed the enhanced microglial behaviors in the diabetic retina. Our simple yet effective approach mitigates the need for advanced optical systems like adaptive optics, providing an effective tool for real-time imaging of the retina. This method offers a valuable resource for visual neuroscience research and holds great potential for clinical applications, particularly in the early diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring of retinal diseases.",Sotani N; Kusuhara S; Nishisho R; Kuno H; Shima H; Haruwaka K; Mori Y; Kishi M; Furuyashiki T; Kobayashi K; Wake H; Takumi T; Nakamura M; Tachibana Y,"Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe 650-0017, Japan.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2025-10-08,10.1073/pnas.2426241122,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Retina; Diabetes mellitus; Microglia; Two-photon Microscopy; Liraglutide
41057487,Modified RECIST submodels and ordinal regression model predict neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy response in locally advanced gastric cancer​​.,"This study evaluated predictive models integrating Computed Tomography(CT) and ultrasound(US) to assess neoadjuvant therapy response in locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC). A prospective multicenter trial (n = 75) developed five RECIST 1.1-derived submodels (RECIST_Expansion, UC_RECIST, CT_RECIST, V-RECIST, U-RECIST) and an ordinal regression-based nomogram, using pathological tumor regression grade (TRG) as the reference standard. The geometric approximation model V-RECIST exhibited superior diagnostic performance for TRG 0-2 vs. 3 discrimination (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.951, sensitivity 96.8%/specificity 80.1%) and TRG 0-1 vs. 2-3 classification (AUC = 0.868, sensitivity 85.7%/specificity 80.0%), validated by calibration curves and decision curve analysis. The US-only U-RECIST demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.906/0.811), suitable for preliminary assessment due to its safety and cost-effectiveness. The remaining models-RECIST_Expansion (lymph node evaluation only), UC_RECIST (CT-US combined protocol with gastric lesions as measurable targets), and CT_RECIST (CT-only for no-US settings)-also showed satisfactory accuracy. The ordinal regression model achieved slightly higher AUC values (0.952/0.870) and cross-validation accuracy (0.73) compared to modified RECIST models. These findings highlight the clinical utility of revised RECIST 1.1 models across diverse scenarios, with V-RECIST demonstrating the highest performance, U-RECIST offering radiation-free assessment and cost-effectiveness, and the ordinal model enhancing visualization while preserving diagnostic superiority.",Chen S; Wei S; Ye Z; Wei C; Liu S; Wang Y; Zeng Y; Chen J; Wang X; Jiang J; Chen X; Chen L,"Department of Gastric Surgery, Clinical Oncology School of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Cancer Hospital，NHC Key Laboratory of Cancer Metabolism, No 420 Fuma Road, Jin'an District, Fuzhou, 350000, Fujian Province, China.",Scientific reports,2025-10-07,10.1038/s41598-025-18988-7,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Neo-adjuvant Therapy; Chemoimmunotherapy; Recist; Color Doppler Ultrasound; Nomogram Model; Local Advanced Gastric Cancer (Lagc)
41053934,Endoscopic Management of Primary External Auditory Canal Cholesteatoma: Outcomes and Technical Considerations.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Primary external auditory canal cholesteatoma (PEACC) represents a rare otologic entity, and the optimal role of endoscopic intervention remains undefined. This study evaluated the technical feasibility and clinical outcomes of endoscopic management for this condition.<h4>Patients</h4>Patients diagnosed with PEACC between 2012 and 2022 were enrolled. Posttreatment surveillance was maintained for all participants, ensuring at least 1 year of follow-up.<h4>Intervention</h4>Endoscopic approach and management for PEACC.<h4>Methods</h4>In the nonoperative treatment group, subjects underwent meticulous keratin debris removal and saline irrigation using the endoscope for visualization. Subjects underwent transcanal exclusive endoscopic ear surgery (TEES), endoscopic-assisted surgery, or canal wall-down mastoidectomy with obliteration in the operative treatment group.<h4>Main outcome measurement</h4>Treatment success was defined as a dry, fully epithelialized, self-cleaning ear.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-five patients who completed the treatment protocols were enrolled. PEACC was categorized as stage II, III, and IV in 7, 41, and 17 cases, respectively. Successful nonoperative treatment using the transcanal endoscopic approach was achieved in 41 patients. TEES and endoscopy-assisted surgery was performed in 9 and 8 patients, respectively. Canal wall-down mastoidectomy with obliteration was performed in 7 patients with the far-advanced stage IV. Recurrence was observed in 1 case, necessitating revision surgical intervention.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Endoscopic intervention is the treatment of choice for PEACC. In cases of limited disease, TEES alone typically achieves excellent outcomes, resulting in a dry, clean, and healed external auditory canal, while extensive cases often require a combined endoscopic and open surgical approach for optimal control.",Plodpai Y; Pitathawatchai P; Prayuenyong P,"Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hatyai, Songkhla Province, Thailand.","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",2025-10-07,10.1097/mao.0000000000004650,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Endoscopy; External Auditory Canal; Endoscopy-assisted Surgery; External Ear Cholesteatoma
41072901,"Accuracy and retention of laminate veneers made from zirconia, resin composite, and lithium disilicate using additive and subtractive techniques: An in vitro study.","<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate and compare the trueness and retention of laminate veneers (LVs) fabricated using four different CAD-CAM material-process combinations, including both additive (AM) and subtractive (SM) manufacturing techniques.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>An in vitro study was conducted using a standardized maxillary central incisor preparation. Eighty LVs were fabricated (n=20/group) from: AM resin composite (AM-RC), AM zirconia (AM-Z), SM advanced lithium disilicate (SM-LDS), and SM zirconia (SM-Z). Trueness was assessed using root mean square (RMS) deviation values and color map visualization. Retention was tested after thermomechanical aging. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test were used for statistical analysis (α=0.05).<h4>Results</h4>There were significant differences in trueness and retention among groups (p<0.005). AM-RC showed the highest RMS values (e.g., internal: 38.32 ±2.2 µm) and the lowest retention (689.85 ±30.81 N). No significant differences in trueness or retention were found between SM-Z (internal: 30.12 ±2.4 µm; 782.10 ±34.12 N), SM-LDS (internal: 31.85 ±2.3 µm; 801.90 ±39.43 N), and AM-Z (internal: 32.45 ±2.5 µm; 799.45 ±33.83 N).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The material type and manufacturing method significantly influenced the adaptation and retention of LVs. AM-Z, SM-Z, and SM-LDS demonstrated comparable and clinically acceptable outcomes, while AM-RC showed inferior trueness and retention.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Subtractive lithium disilicate and zirconia, as well as high-performance additive zirconia, exhibited clinically acceptable adaptation and retention, supporting their use in definitive laminate veneers. In contrast, printed resin composite showed inferior performance and should be limited to provisional applications.",Sasany R; Çakmak G; Mosaddad SA,"Department of Prosthodontics, Biruni University, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul, Turkey.

41059268,Comprehensive mixed reality surgical navigation system for liver surgery.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Intraoperative liver deformation and the need to glance repeatedly between the operative field and a remote monitor undermine the precision and workflow of image-guided liver surgery. Existing mixed reality (MR) prototypes address only isolated aspects of this challenge and lack quantitative validation in deformable anatomy.<h4>Approach</h4>We introduce a fully self-contained MR navigation system for liver surgery that runs on a MR headset and bridges this clinical gap by (1) stabilizing holographic content with an external retro-reflective reference tool that defines a fixed world origin, (2) tracking instruments and surface points in real time with the headset's depth camera, and (3) compensating soft-tissue deformation through a weighted ICP + linearized iterative boundary reconstruction pipeline. A lightweight server-client architecture streams deformation-corrected 3D models to the headset and enables hands-free control via voice commands.<h4>Results</h4>Validation on a multistate liver-phantom protocol demonstrated that the reference tool reduced mean hologram drift from 4.0±1.2  mm to 1.1±0.3  mm and improved tracking accuracy from 3.6±1.3 to 2.3±0.8  mm . Across five simulated deformation states, nonrigid registration lowered surface target registration error from 7.4±4.8 to 3.0±2.7  mm -an average 57% error reduction-yielding sub-4 mm guidance accuracy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By unifying stable MR visualization, tool tracking, and biomechanical deformation correction in a single headset, the proposed platform eliminates monitor-related context switching and restores spatial fidelity lost to liver motion. The device-agnostic framework is extendable to open approaches and potentially laparoscopic workflows and other soft-tissue interventions, marking a significant step toward MR-enabled surgical navigation.",Xiang B; Heiselman JS; Miga MI,"Vanderbilt University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Nashville, Tennessee, United States.","Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)",2025-10-06,10.1117/1.jmi.12.5.055001,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Tracking; Image-guided Surgery; Liver Surgery; Augmented Reality; Surgical Navigation; Mixed Reality; Deformation Correction
41051690,The World's First Long-Distance Tele-Robotic Bariatric Surgery Using an Indigenous Robotic Platform: A Landmark Case Series of One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass with the SSI Mantra System.,"<h4>Background</h4>Robotic-assisted surgery has transformed the field of bariatric surgery by enhancing precision, ergonomics, and visualization. Telesurgery, where the surgeon operates remotely via robotic interface, represents the next frontier in expanding access to expert surgical care. The SSI Mantra system, developed in India, is a cost-effective, multi-arm robotic platform now deployed for tele-surgical applications.<h4>Aim</h4>To assess the feasibility, safety, and early outcomes of tele-surgical robotic One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) procedures using the indigenously developed SSI Mantra system.<h4>Method</h4>In this prospective case series conducted in July 2025, ten patients underwent tele-robotic OAGB at Mohak Bariatrics and Robotics Center, Indore. All telesurgeries were performed with the patient cart stationed at Mohak Bariatrics and Robotics Center, Indore, while the robotic consoles were operated remotely two cases from the SSI Headquarters in Gurgaon (900 km away) and eight cases from IRCAD-India, Indore (1.5 km away). A five-port standardized robotic OAGB technique was employed.

41064080,Diagnostic value of super-resolution ultrasound imaging in differentiating benign and malignant BI-RADS-4 breast lesions.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Benign and malignant breast tumors exhibit distinct microvascular morphological patterns and spatial distribution characteristics; however, current clinical imaging modalities cannot comprehensively assess their microvascular network architecture. Super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) imaging addresses this critical gap by providing super-resolved visualization of microvascular topology. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of SRUS imaging in visualizing breast lesion microvasculature and establishing diagnostic models for BI-RADS 4 masses.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 120 breast lesions from 117 patients with conventional ultrasound-confirmed BI-RADS 4 lesions were prospectively enrolled in this study between July 2024 and January 2025. Preoperative conventional ultrasound and SRUS examinations were performed on all included patients. Based on pathological findings, the lesions were categorized as benign (n = 85) or malignant (n = 35). The benign group was further stratified into hypovascular (n = 42) and hypervascular (n = 43) subgroups based on the SRUS enhancement levels. Univariate analysis was performed to screen SRUS parameters, and variables with <i>P</i> < 0.05 were incorporated into multivariate logistic regression models to construct nomogram-based predictive models and validated using ROC analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Max vel (OR = 1.848, 95% CI: 1.205-3.122), curvature (A/E) (OR = 2.162, 95% CI: 1.981-2.323), and complexity level (OR = 1.772, 95% CI: 1.608-1.942) independently predicted malignancy (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). Curvature (A/E) and complexity level were also independent markers for distinguishing malignant lesions from hypervascular benign lesions (curvature (A/E): OR = 1.808, 95% CI: 1.612-1.987; complexity level: OR = 1.952, 95% CI: 1.804-2.181; both <i>P</i> < 0.05). The nomogram prediction models demonstrated high diagnostic efficacy, with AUC values of 0.899 (95% CI: 0.844-0.953) (sensitivity = 94.3%, specificity = 76.5%) for benign compared to 0.816 (95% CI: 0.721-0.910 (sensitivity = 65.1%, specificity = 88.6%) for malignant differentiation. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test indicated adequate model fit (all <i>P</i> > 0.05). The nomogram prediction model demonstrated superior net benefit in predicting breast cancer compared to alternative strategies.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SRUS enables microvascular characterization of breast lesions, with validated nomograms demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy for early cancer detection.",Hou X; Li Z; Liu Y; Gao J; Song T,"Department of Abdominal Ultrasound, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Ultrasound Medicine, Urumqi, China.",Frontiers in oncology,2025-10-06,10.3389/fonc.2025.1662492,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Prediction model; Breast Lesions; Nomogram; Srus; Bi-Rads 4 Category
41053419,Building a coronavirus disease 2019 healthcare registry in an evolving pandemic.,"COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As there were many unknowns about COVID-19, an immediate priority early in the pandemic was to collect high-quality data to understand disease characteristics and epidemiology to inform healthcare resource management. A COVID-19 registry was developed by Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) to support clinical, operational, and research needs. We describe the development process of the SingHealth COVID-19 registry. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and managed by the Singapore Health Services (SingHealth), the largest of three public healthcare clusters in Singapore that includes acute hospitals, national specialty centres, subacute hospitals, and primary health centres, were included in the registry. A combination of laboratory test results and nationally administered electronic disease tags were used to identify COVID-19 patients. A dashboard was built in the Electronic Health Intelligence System (eHIntS), the data repository within SingHealth, linking variables in a minimum data set (MDS) using patient identifiers. Healthcare utilization in different ward types was computed, and 19 comorbidities and 14 complications were derived and coded from raw data sources within eHints for hospitalized patients. The COVID-19 registry contains more than 100 variables across 15 data domains, including raw data in long format (e.g. problem list, movement within hospital) and derived variables (e.g. comorbidities, complications, outcomes). As of December 31, 2023, the COVID-19 registry comprises of 156,262 unique patients of whom, 27,630 were admitted for COVID-19 at least once at one of the SingHealth hospitals. It has provided data for operational, clinical, and research purposes. The SingHealth COVID-19 registry is a model of how a low-cost, automated database can be developed amidst an evolving pandemic, leveraging on pandemic-necessitated standardized clinical workflows for pandemic operations, clinical management and research.",Venkatachalam I; Conceicao EP; Sim JXY; Arora S; Yang Y; Shoon JY; Xu Y; Ong MEH; Chan SL,"Department of Infection Prevention and Epidemiology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore. indumathi.venkatachalam@singhealth.com.sg.",Scientific reports,2025-10-06,10.1038/s41598-025-98723-4,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Disease Registry; Automated Surveillance; Covid-19
41061108,Monitoring People With COVID-19 at Home With the COVIDFree@Home Program: Feasibility Cohort Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>During the COVID-19 pandemic, many with acute infection isolated at home, with a small but significant number requiring hospitalization. At the time, since the pathogen was fairly unknown, clinicians were uncertain about which patients would rapidly deteriorate and need hospitalization. We developed the COVIDFree@Home smartphone app and clinician dashboard to monitor and support people managing at home with acute COVID-19 infection. It was uncertain whether such an app would be used by patients and whether it would support patient care. This knowledge would inform telemedicine and digital health tools being used to deliver care to patients remotely at that time.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to determine the feasibility of using a smartphone app and clinician dashboard for remote clinical monitoring of people with COVID-19 at home.<h4>Methods</h4>A feasibility study set at 3 hospital sites (University Health Network, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, and Trillium Health Partners) between 2020 and 2022 was conducted. Participants newly diagnosed with COVID-19 were asked to enter data into a smartphone app called COVIDFree@Home twice daily for 10 days while isolating at home. Their data, including symptoms, temperature, and oxygen saturation, were monitored on a clinician-facing dashboard. The primary outcome of feasibility was the number of patients who used the app. We also examined patient satisfaction through a survey questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 431 patients were recruited, out of which 229 (56.5%) were females and the average age was 38.9 (SD 12.8) years. There were 376 (87.2%) participants who used the app to report symptoms or oxygen saturation at least once. Among these participants, 373 (99.2%) reported symptoms and 363 (96.5%) reported oxygen saturation. Participants reported symptoms an average of 1.7 (SD 1.1) times per day for a median of 5 (IQR 3-8) days. Oxygen saturation levels were reported 1.5 times per day for a median of 6 (IQR 4-9) days. There were 19 hospitalizations (4.4%) among study participants. Most patients felt comfortable using the app, felt reassured their data was being monitored and did not have privacy concerns.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients with acute COVID-19 infection engaged with a remote home monitoring platform, however, not at the recommended frequency or duration. Remote patient monitoring of acute respiratory infection appears viable and can offer patients reassurance. It has the potential to reduce strain on the health care system during future pandemics, but further evidence is required to demonstrate improved health outcomes.",Gershon AS; Mariakakis A; de Lara E; Munn J; Calligan M; Liaqat D; Liaqat S; Chen J; To T; Lam PW; Simor A; Chan AK; Andany N; Masood S; Daneman N; Chan T; Graham C; Comondore V; de Moulliac A; Tu AY; Wu R,"Department of Medicine, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",JMIR formative research,2025-10-08,10.2196/69140,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Pandemic; Oxygen saturation; Remote Monitoring; Mobile Application; Covid-19
41075550,"Impacts of spills on water quality and treatment plants: A case study using hydrodynamic and water quality modeling in the Nile River, Egypt.","Accidental pollution spills have significant impacts on Water Treatment Plants (WTPs), which frequently require temporary closures to protect public health. While research on the Nile River in Egypt has focused on evaluating overall water quality, relatively few studies have simulated spill accidents and their impacts on water treatment plants. This research fills the gap by modeling phosphate spill scenarios and examining the effects of phosphate spills on water treatment plants (WTPs) along the Nile River Reach Four, including the Deer-Alkaseer, Dairout, and Deir-Mawas WTPs. The Delft3D model was used to simulate hydrodynamic and water quality scenarios under both minimum and maximum flow conditions. The results were calibrated by comparing them with data from gauge and monitoring stations to ensure accuracy. Multiple phosphate spill scenarios were simulated in front of the Deer-Alkaseer with varying spill amounts and durations. The results revealed that spill concentration and duration significantly affect plume characteristics such as concentration levels, time to peak, and travel time. Extended spills with low concentrations resulted in minimal contamination, maintaining them under regulatory thresholds and indicating that shutting down the WTPs would not be necessary. These events can be detected using real-time monitoring systems with water quality sensors. The duration of the spill and flow conditions significantly influenced the time to peak concentration, regardless of the spill concentration. Plume duration increased with higher spill concentrations and longer durations, particularly under minimum flow conditions. Spill scenarios can support a smart dashboard using spill scenarios data to help tiered operational plans for WTPs.",Magdy A; Ramadan E; Moussa A; Negm A,"Water and Water Structures Engineering Dept., Faculty of Engineering, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt.

41051853,"Clinical System for Mood Disorder Care in Córdoba, Colombia: Participatory Design and Scenario-Based Usability Evaluation Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Mood disorders are among the leading causes of disability worldwide and present a growing public health concern. In Córdoba, Colombia, suicide rates have risen significantly in recent years, exposing structural gaps in mental health care delivery. Digital health solutions and telehealth interventions can expand access to early detection, referral, and monitoring of patients in underserved regions. However, their effectiveness depends on rigorous and diverse evaluations to ensure adoption and sustainability.<h4>Objective</h4>This study evaluated the usability of a clinical telehealth system for mood disorder care developed through participatory design, with emphasis on user-centered functionality and workload analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>The system was designed through 2 iterative development cycles, followed by a scenario-based usability evaluation. A functional Domain Ontology was constructed to prioritize 8 core functionalities, including telecounseling, a georeferenced institutional directory, hotline services, patient self-report tools, educational content, forums, and a population dashboard. Thirty participants representing patients, caregivers, clinical staff, and administrative personnel were recruited through convenience sampling. Usability was assessed through cognitive walk-throughs, the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Task Load Index, and the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 34 usability sessions and 223 task-level workload assessments were conducted across 2 evaluation cycles. The system demonstrated high usability, with overall Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire scores of 2.2 in cycle 1 and 2.3 in cycle 2. Interfaces prioritized for patients and clinical staff achieved better evaluations (average 1.9-2.0) than administrative interfaces (average 3.0). Workload analysis indicated improvements between cycles, particularly for patient-centered tasks, with mental workload as the most significant source of cognitive demand. Twenty-three critical issues (9 system errors and 14 design flaws) were identified and corrected between cycles, leading to measurable usability gains.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The participatory and scenario-based approach facilitated early identification of usability challenges and supported iterative refinement of the system. Results suggest that the system is usable, acceptable, and effective in reducing workload for key user groups, particularly patients and clinicians. The findings reinforce the value of participatory methodologies in digital mental health and highlight the need to prioritize patient-facing interfaces.

41052435,"Assessing a Community Health Worker-Facilitated, Digitally Delivered, Family-Centered Diabetes Management Program: Single-Arm Quasi-Experimental Study.","<h4>Background</h4>The high prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and associated complications disproportionately affect low-income Latino populations, who also experience disparities in diabetes self-management (DSM), including poor medication adherence, physical activity, diet, and glycemic control.<h4>Objective</h4>This study examined, through an academic-community partnership, the effectiveness of ¡Salud, Salud! (an evidence-based, family-centered diabetes self-management education and support [DSMES] program) on primary (glycemic control and quality of life) and secondary (social, psychological, and behavioral factors related to T2D management) outcomes among low-income Latino adults with T2D or prediabetes.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 81 adults (mean age 48.90 years, SD 12.57; n=57, 70.4%, female; n=66, 81.5%, Latino) with T2D or prediabetes were enrolled in a 12-week, single-arm quasi-experimental study conducted in two Central Texas Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) locations. ¡Salud, Salud! incorporated individual coaching by community health workers (CHWs), online family-centered DSMES training lessons, and a YMCA family membership. The delivery of ¡Salud, Salud! was supported and facilitated by digital technologies, including a dashboard to deliver intervention content and monitor participants' engagement in intervention activities. Outcomes measured at baseline and 12 weeks (ie, postintervention) included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); quality of life; anthropometrics; self-reported physical activity and diet; mindfulness; perceived stress; and diabetes-related knowledge, self-efficacy, and support. Participant engagement in program activities was assessed via four index variables that underlay multiple dimensions of influences on ¡Salud, Salud! uptake: family engagement and support, participation in self-management education, program support and facilitation, and participation in self-monitoring. Paired t-tests and McNemar chi-square tests were used to examine the change in outcomes from baseline to 12 weeks. The number of program activities participants completed for each engagement index variable was converted to percentages to estimate the mean proportion of activities completed.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 48 (59.3%) participants completed the 12-week posttest. At the end of the program, participants demonstrated a marginally significant reduction in HbA1c (-0.30%, P≤.09) and a significant increase in participants reporting good-to-excellent health from baseline (n=19, 39.6%) to posttest (n=28, 58.3%; P≤.003). There were significant reductions in body weight (-1.30 kg, P=.02), body fat percentage (-1.26%, P=.01), perceived stress (-0.28, P=.02), added sugar intake (-2.15 teaspoons/day, P=.001), and time spent sedentary per week (-70.27 minutes, P=.003) from baseline to posttest. Mindfulness increased significantly (2.21, P=.01). Participant engagement in ¡Salud, Salud! varied, with participants exhibiting a high completion rate in program support and facilitation activities (88%) and a moderate-to-low completion rate in self-management training (66%), self-monitoring (56%), and family engagement and support (49%) activities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>¡Salud, Salud! shows promising preliminary effects on key diabetes-related outcomes.

41063300,Ten mouse organs proteome and metabolome atlas from adult to aging.,"<h4>Background</h4>Aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive molecular alterations across multiple organ systems, significantly influencing disease susceptibility and mortality. Unraveling molecular interactions driving aging is crucial for interventions promoting healthy aging and mitigating senescence. However, the systemic mechanisms governing both inter-organ interactions and organ-specific aging trajectories remain incompletely characterized.<h4>Methods</h4>To investigate the molecular dynamics of aging, we conducted a systematic multi-omics analysis of 400 tissue samples collected from 10 organs (brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, skin, spleen, and stomach) in mice at four distinct life stages: 4, 8, 12, and 20 months (from youth to elderly). Proteomic profiling was performed using data-independent acquisition (DIA) technology, while metabolomic analysis was performed in both positive and negative ion modes. Differential expression analysis of proteins and metabolites was employed to construct a comprehensive multi-organ aging dataset.<h4>Results</h4>Proteomic profiling across ten organs at four age stages identified a total of 14,763 protein groups (PGs). Of these, 18 proteins, including Ighm, C4b, and Hpx, exhibited consistent age-related differential expression patterns across all ten organs. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted the humoral immune response as a primary driver of age-related expression changes. Additionally, this study mapped a set of age-unique proteins, such as Hp, Egf, and Arg, with distinct expression patterns in aging organs. Metabolic analysis identified 3779 metabolites, with key aging-related metabolites such as NAD+, inosine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine showing significant expression changes across multiple organs. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed consistent alterations in purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, and nicotinate/nicotinamide metabolism during multi-organ aging.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides a multi-omics atlas of multi-organ aging, revealing both intra- and inter-organ similarities and heterogeneities. These findings offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying geriatric health decline and serve as a foundational resource for organism-systematic early warning and targeted interventions against aging-associated pathologies.",Wang Q; Xu Z; Ding X; Wang A; Song S; Zhang S; Chen Y; Ding Y; Jiang L; Ding X,"Department of Anesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care Unit, School of Medicine and School of Biomedical Engineering, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.",Genome medicine,2025-10-08,10.1186/s13073-025-01535-4,0.5,data(abstract),Aging; Proteomics; Metabolomics; Multi-Organs
