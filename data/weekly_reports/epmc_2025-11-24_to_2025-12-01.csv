41291759,Artificial intelligence at the gut-oral microbiota frontier: mapping machine learning tools for gastric cancer risk prediction.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health burden, with high mortality due to delayed diagnosis. Advances in microbiome profiling and artificial intelligence (AI) have opened new frontiers in non-invasive cancer risk prediction. However, the methodological landscape of AI-driven microbiome-based GC prediction remains fragmented and poorly standardized.<h4>Objective</h4>To systematically review and critically evaluate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models developed for gastric cancer prediction using microbial and non-invasive biomarkers, spanning gut, gastric mucosal, and oral ecosystems as well as tongue-based imaging proxies. We aimed to map methodological rigor, translational readiness, and biomarker convergence across these domains.<h4>Methods</h4>We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed studies published up to March 2025. Eligible studies applied ML or deep learning models to microbiome datasets for GC diagnosis, risk classification, or treatment response. Data extraction included sample source, sequencing method, taxonomic resolution, ML model type, validation strategy, performance metrics, interpretability tools, and reported microbial taxa. Descriptive synthesis, thematic clustering, and readiness scoring were conducted using structured visual analytics.<h4>Results</h4>Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Sample sources included gastric mucosa, feces, saliva, tongue coating, and tumor tissue. 16S rRNA sequencing was most common, with models primarily trained on genus-level data. Random Forest was the most frequently used algorithm (44.4%), followed by LASSO, LightGBM, and deep learning. AUC values ranged from 0.88 to 0.97 in validated models. However, only 33.3% of studies employed external validation, and interpretability and reporting standards varied widely. A Clinical Readiness Matrix and Validation Quality Assessment highlighted key translational gaps. Recurrent microbial biomarkers included Veillonella, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas.<h4>Conclusion</h4>AI-based microbiome models, including non-invasive diagnostics, show high potential for gastric cancer prediction. Yet, reproducibility, external validation, and reporting transparency remain critical barriers to clinical implementation. Standardized pipelines, multi-omics integration, and prospective validation are needed to transition this field from proof-of-concept to precision oncology.",Azhdarimoghaddam A; Mohammad Bigloo A; Soleimani Meigoli MS; Abdelbaset M; Narimani M; Dadkhah Tehrani F; Asadi Anar M; Abdolvand F; Goudarzi P; Ghazizadeh Y; Mohammadzadeh N; Eini P; Khosravi F; Abouzeid M,"Student Research Committee, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.",Biomedical engineering online,2025-11-25,10.1186/s12938-025-01487-1,12.7,"visual analytics(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,title,abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Gastric cancer; Predictive modeling; Systematic review; Biomarker Discovery; Machine Learning; Microbiome
41299770,The effect of acetyl tributyl citrate on coronary heart disease: a comprehensive computational analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent research suggests a link between acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) exposure and an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).<h4>Objective</h4>This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying ATBC's potential role in CHD pathogenesis.<h4>Methods</h4>Using ""Acetyl tributyl citrate"" as a search term, relevant targets were retrieved from the ChEMBL database. The standard simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) notation of ATBC was submitted to the SwissTargetPrediction database. All the targets obtained were compiled to create a target database for ATBC. Functional enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to explore the potential pathogenic mechanisms of ATBC. The GSE66360 dataset was used as the training dataset, while GSE48060 and GSE60993 served as validation datasets. A total of 107 combinations of eleven machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Elastic Net (Enet), support vector machine (SVM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, Ridge regression, gradient boosting with component-wise linear model (glmBoost), partial least squares regression for generalized linear model (plsRglm), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Naive Bayes, and stepwise generalized linear model (Stepglm), were applied to identify the model with the highest area under the curve (AUC) as the best diagnostic model. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify key hub genes. Single-cell transcriptomic data were employed to locate these hub genes, while molecular docking further validated the binding capacity between ATBC and its hub targets. This included converting the ligand to 3D format, performing molecular docking, and calculating the binding affinity and hydrogen bond formation between the molecules. The binding site with the lowest predicted binding affinity was selected for visualization.<h4>Result</h4>By integrating ATBC targets with CHD core modules, we identified genes associated with ATBC-induced CHD. Using the RF algorithm, we constructed the optimal diagnostic model and identified key hub genes, including MMP9, NLRP3, and PLAU. These genes were closely associated with glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, induction of estrogen resistance, and vascular inflammation. Furthermore, NLRP3 was predominantly expressed in monocytes, while PLAU showed higher expression in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The molecular docking results indicated that the calculated predicted binding affinities were all less than or equal to -5.0 kcal/mol. This confirmed the binding affinities of ATBC with MMP9 and PLAU, and supported their involvement in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study predicted ATBC's potential mechanisms in CHD progression and identified key hub genes, notably MMP9, NLRP3, and PLAU. These findings provide novel molecular targets for future research and highlight the potential health risks of ATBC in everyday applications.",Ma X; Liu Y; Hua Z; Jiang F; Shi S; Wang K; Yu J; Zhang L,"First Clinical Medical College, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, 250355, China.",BMC pharmacology & toxicology,2025-11-26,10.1186/s40360-025-01023-w,8.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,abstract); data(abstract); informatics(kw)",Bioinformatics; Molecular docking; Coronary Heart Disease; Machine Learning; Acetyl Tributyl Citrate; Network Toxicology
41312144,A new method for assessing chronic insomnia: Machine learning-based fusion of TCM observation digital features.,"<h4>Background</h4>In the clinical assessment of chronic insomnia, modern medicine encounters challenges in the widespread adoption of objective assessment methods, such as polysomnography, due to their high costs and complex operational requirements. Therefore, it was crucial to implement objective and varied methods to accurately assess chronic insomnia.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical information was collected from 594 patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia. Their facial and tongue features, as observed through traditional Chinese medicine, were recorded using the tongue face diagnosis analysis-1 instrument and analyzed with the tongue/face diagnosis analysis system. Stepwise-regression analysis, principal component analysis, and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression were employed for variable screening. Ultimately, the classification model for assessing the severity of chronic insomnia was constructed using six supervised machine learning methods: decision trees, neural networks, random forests, support vector machines, logistic regression, and naive Bayes. The model was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, precision, and accuracy. Visualization was conducted with the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) explainer and decision curve analysis (DCA), and it was finally calibrated using Platt scaling.<h4>Results</h4>A comprehensive evaluation revealed that model 4 exhibited superior performance. This model integrated baseline data, sleep symptoms, and facial features, achieving its highest receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.822. Furthermore, DCA demonstrated that model 4 exhibited significant clinical utility. The SHAP illustrated that among the variables exerting the greatest influence on insomnia, the effects of Ch-Y and CH-G were notably prominent, compared to the conventional PSQI and SAS, followed by Ch-R. Finally, the results of Platt scaling calibration indicated that model 4 exhibited significant improvement post-calibration, with the predicted probabilities closely aligning with the actual probabilities of occurrence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study emphasized convenient and non-invasive diagnostic methods for investigating specific facial and tongue features associated with chronic insomnia. A classification model for chronic insomnia has been developed through the integration of multiple features, enabling a more accurate assessment of insomnia severity and facilitating advancements in therapeutic interventions.",Wang Y; Chen J; Chen Q; Huang X; Shi Y; Li Z; Wang X; Xu L; Xu J,"School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.",Digital health,2025-11-25,10.1177/20552076251393331,7.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Traditional Chinese medicine; Facial features; tongue diagnosis; Machine Learning; Chronic Insomnia
41316123,Patient-specific virtual surgical simulation: the preliminary exploration of surgical evaluation for difficult pediatric liver tumors.,"<h4>Background</h4>The surgical evaluation of pediatric liver tumors is challenging, especially in difficult cases that require precise surgery. Three-dimensional visualization (3D) based on two-dimensional CT (2D) has been widely used. However, virtual surgical simulation (VS), which can provide more procedural details for specific patients, is worthy of further exploration.<h4>Methods</h4>Six pediatric liver tumor patients with the surgical difficulty increasing sequentially were selected. Recruited pediatric surgeons (15 junior and 15 senior) guided professional technicians in performing surgical evaluation using 2D, 3D, and VS sequentially. The patient-specific VS based on 3D can be constructed within the clinically permissible time window to meet clinical needs.<h4>Results</h4>For objective analysis, the scores in 3D Group and VS Group were significantly higher than those in 2D Group (P < 0.0001), and there was also a statistically significant difference between 3D Group and VS Group (P < 0.0001). As the difficulty increased, the 3D Group and VS Group consistently maintained higher scores. The scores of Junior Group using 2D were significantly lower than those of Senior Group (P < 0.0001), but there was no significant statistical difference in the scores of using 3D and VS. For subjective assessment, the scores of 3D Group and VS Group were significantly higher than those of 2D Group (P < 0.0001). VS was more aligned with clinical reality compared to 3D.<h4>Conclusion</h4>3D and VS offer significant advantages in surgical evaluation compared with 2D, particularly for difficult cases and junior surgeons. The novel perspective and realistic experience provided by VS have attracted attention, and future research will further validate its potential clinical value in preoperative rehearsals and advanced training.",Xiu W; Liu J; Chen J; Zhang J; Yang C; Wang K; Zhu R; Yu L; Zhou X; Wang F; Borgioli L; Ducas A; Jia S; Dong Q,"Department of Pediatric Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Shinan District, Qingdao, Shandong Province, 266003, China.",BMC surgery,2025-11-28,10.1186/s12893-025-03380-z,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Liver Surgery; Three-dimensional Visualization; Surgical Evaluation; Pediatric Liver Tumor; Virtual Surgical Simulation
41290748,Cervical image visualization and improvement for clinical support in diagnosis and treatment.,"Cervical white light imaging (CWLI) plays a key role in diagnosing and managing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) but is limited by uneven illumination, low contrast, and specular reflections. Cervical image visualization and improvement (CIVI) is designed to improve contrast and uniform brightness while maintaining the histological accuracy of colposcopic images to clearly identify tissue differences. CIVI combines multiple image enhancement techniques, including specular reflection removal, illumination correction, and local contrast enhancement, in a unified framework. This technique was validated on 52 histologically confirmed CWLI images (CIN 1-3). We performed a Local Binary Pattern (LBP) analysis to extract cervical epithelial texture features and quantified blood contrast using the Michelson contrast (MC). A qualitative assessment was conducted by five expert colposcopists using a four-level scale. The mean LBP distance between lesion and normal tissue showed a marked increase from 0.192 to 0.391. The mean MC for blood area and surrounding tissue improved from 0.216 to 0.290. Experts observed an improvement in image quality for all CIN grades, with an average score increase of + 0.71. These initial experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework to enhance the visualization of CIN, support better treatment decisions, and enable more personalized care.",Tran VT; Pham TH; Phan NKC,"Faculty of Applied Science, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), 268 Ly Thuong Kiet Street, Dien Hong Ward, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. tranvantien@hcmut.edu.vn.",Scientific reports,2025-11-25,10.1038/s41598-025-25639-4,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Blood vessels; Colposcopy; Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; Texture; Cervical Imaging; Specular Reflection Removal
40856615,A silicone adhesive with ultralong room-temperature phosphorescence for direct damage visualization.,"Visual detection of early-stage microdamage is crucial for structural health monitoring to avoid catastrophic failures and extend equipment durability. However, current detection approaches are hampered by complex multi-component formulations and harsh operational requirements, making facile <i>in situ</i> microdamage visualization challenging. Herein, we report a novel room temperature phosphorescent adhesive (RTPA) <i>via</i> dynamic B-O bonds, achieving persistent phosphorescence emission in commercial adhesive systems. The resulting RTPAs exhibit ultralong phosphorescence lifetimes (up to 1.931 s) under ambient conditions, surpassing those of all reported RTP-based adhesives. As a silicone-based adhesive, the RTPA possesses versatile adhesion capability for various substrates, ranging from metals, inorganic compounds to polymers. More importantly, leveraging ultralong-lived phosphorescence emission in the dark, RTPAs enable <i>in situ</i> visual detection of microdamage in bonded substrates such as glasses. Therefore, such advantages make RTPAs promising candidates for damage visualization, anti-counterfeiting adhesives and information encryption.",Li N; Gu S; Wu Q; Wu J,"College of Polymer Science and Engineering, National Key Laboratory of Advanced Polymer Materials, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China. wuqi57@scu.edu.cn.",Materials horizons,2025-11-25,10.1039/d5mh01227a,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",
41317206,Advanced neuroimaging in pediatric epilepsy surgery: state of the art and future perspectives.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To review recent advances in structural MRI post-processing for pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy, with emphasis on artificial intelligence-driven and quantitative techniques, including MELD-Graph, MAP18, FLAT1, and SUPR-FLAIR, and to evaluate their impact on lesion detection, epileptogenic zone localization, and presurgical planning.<h4>Methods</h4>Novel post-processing approaches were examined with respect to their computational foundations, imaging requirements, and diagnostic performance. Techniques employing machine learning, deep learning, voxel-based morphometry, cortical surface projection, and FLAIR/T1 ratio mapping were assessed for their applicability in children and their integration into multimodal evaluation pathways alongside electrophysiology and functional imaging.<h4>Results</h4>Advanced post-processing tools substantially increase sensitivity for detecting subtle cortical abnormalities, particularly in MRI-negative pediatric epilepsy. MELD-Graph identify features of focal cortical dysplasia through automated surface-based analysis and deep neural network classification, achieving notable lesion detection even when conventional MRI findings are normal. MAP18 provides complementary voxel-wise morphometric assessment, improving specificity and benefiting from optimized structural sequences. FLAT1 enhances lesion conspicuity by quantifying FLAIR/T1 signal relationships, while SUPR-FLAIR improves visualization of cortical signal abnormalities through normalized FLAIR intensity projection onto the cortical surface. When incorporated into multimodal diagnostic workflows, these methods refine epileptogenic zone localization, inform individualized surgical strategies, and can reduce reliance on invasive testing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Advanced structural MRI post-processing is transforming the neuroradiological evaluation of pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy. By revealing subtle cortical abnormalities not visible on conventional imaging, these tools support more precise lesion characterization and surgical planning. Ongoing efforts toward standardization, clinical validation, and workflow integration will be essential to ensure widespread adoption and maximize clinical impact within precision-medicine approaches to pediatric epilepsy.",Tortora D; Couto R; Panzeri S; Parodi C; Resaz M; Ramaglia A; Pacetti M; Nobile G; Francione S; Consales A; Severino M; Rossi A,"Neuroradiology Unit, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy. domenicotortora@gaslini.org.",Neuroradiology,2025-11-29,10.1007/s00234-025-03859-9,6.5,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract); machine learning(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Surgical Planning; Focal Cortical Dysplasia; Pediatric Epilepsy; Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery; Mri Post-processing
41276617,"The effect of using vein visualization devices to facilitate peripheral intravenous cannulation on pain, fear, and patient satisfaction in adult oncology patients: a randomized controlled trial.","<h4>Objective</h4>To investigate the effect of vascular imaging using near-infrared (NIR) light and transilluminator devices on pain, fear of pain, and patient satisfaction during peripheral intravenous cannulation (PIVC) insertion.<h4>Methods</h4>NIR light visualization (n = 50) and transilluminator (n = 50) techniques were used in the intervention, while the standard method was used in the control group (n = 52). The primary outcome was the success rate of first-attempt PIVC insertion, pain, and fear of pain with the PIVC procedure. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction and duration of cannulation.<h4>Results</h4>The rate of successful first-attempt cannulation was 90% in the NIR light group, 70% in the transilluminator group, and 96.2% in the control group. No statistically significant difference was observed between the intensities of PIVC pain and fear of PIVC insertion pain between the groups. NIR light and control group participants' satisfaction and overall experience of PIVC insertion scores were higher than transilluminator participants. The PIVC procedure length of time for the transilluminator group (43.88 ± 10.5 s) participants was higher than that of the NIR light (29.06 ± 11.52 s) and control group (27.19 ± 14.83 s) participants (p < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The difference obtained in the study did not reveal a significant enough difference to determine the best method to reduce pain and fear of pain. Additionally, regarding patient satisfaction, participants in the NIR light and control groups reported higher satisfaction levels than the transilluminator group. The transilluminator group had the longest PIVC procedure. Vein visibility scores differed significantly among the groups, with higher visibility observed in the NIR light and control groups than in the transilluminator group.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The trial was prospectively registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05892978) on June 6, 2023, and received approval from the Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Bursa Uludag University Faculty of Medicine (Approval no: 2023-11/42 date: May 16, 2023).",Yılmaz H; Karacan Y; Macun S; Evrensel T,"Department of Fundamentals of Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, Bursa Uludag University, Gorukle, Bursa, 16059, Türkiye. hlyyilmaz@uludag.edu.tr.",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2025-11-24,10.1007/s00520-025-10187-4,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Pain; Catheterization; Patient Satisfaction; Fear Of Pain; Vein Viewer; Vascular Access Efficiencies
41283980,Artificial intelligence-based decision support systems and their role in vascular surgery and clinical practice.,"Artificial intelligence-based decision support systems (AI-DSS) are gaining attention in medicine as tools for diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment planning. By processing large, heterogeneous datasets, these systems can recognize patterns and generate predictions that complement clinical expertise. Vascular surgery is a relevant case, given its reliance on imaging, patient-specific risk stratification, and complex perioperative choices. Applications in vascular surgery span imaging, intraoperative guidance, and predictive modeling. Deep learning methods support segmentation of aneurysms and peripheral arteries, detection of plaques, and classification of stenoses, achieving accuracy comparable to expert analysis. Intraoperative models aid endoleak detection and graft visualization during endovascular repair. Predictive approaches refine management of abdominal aortic aneurysms by combining imaging, biomechanical modeling, and biomarkers to improve on diameter-based thresholds. Postoperative models forecast complications, survival, and reintervention, while emerging concepts such as digital twins and wearable monitoring suggest more continuous, personalized vascular care. Despite promise, adoption faces barriers. Many models remain ""black boxes,"" raising concerns about interpretability, generalizability, and integration with electronic records. Ethical and legal issues - including accountability, fairness, informed consent, and patient autonomy - are central, with frameworks such as the EU AI Act and FDA guidance beginning to set standards. High development costs and uncertain reimbursement further limit implementation. Building trust will require transparency, reliability, and assurance that AI supports rather than replaces human judgment. Future progress depends on rigorous external validation, workflow integration, and co-design with clinicians. Meeting these conditions could allow AI-DSS to evolve into reliable tools that enhance precision, safety, and personalization in vascular surgery while preserving human values in care.",Ayyalasomayajula V; Veen KM; Wolterink JM; Smit N; Jessen R; Ploem C; Yeung KK,"Department of Surgery, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Location AMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.",The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,2025-11-24,10.23736/s0021-9509.25.13491-5,5.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(title,abstract); data(abstract)",
41284205,Lymph Node Invasion Prediction in Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Machine-Learning Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Accurate preoperative prediction of lymph node invasion (LNI) in prostate cancer is critical for guiding lymph node dissection. Current nomograms often fail to optimall balance the risks of missing metastatic cases and unnecessary dissections. Machine-learning models can provide improved predictive performance through more flexible modeling of complex clinical data.<h4>Methods</h4>The authors developed machine-learning models using clinicopathologic features to predict LNI. Due to a significant class imbalance between LNI-positive and LNI-negative cases, a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance the dataset. Four machine-learning algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Extreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost]) were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was performed for interpretability.<h4>Results</h4>The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest predictive performance. Key predictive features included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density, clinical stage, and presence of the cribriform pattern. Use of SHAP analysis enabled visualization of individual feature contributions. Compared with existing nomograms, Random Forest and XGBoost achieved superior discrimination performance.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Machine-learning models may outperform traditional nomograms in predicting LNI in prostate cancer, especially when trained on balanced datasets and combined with explainability tools such as SHAP.

41305902,In-Situ Spatial Visual Proteomics Enabled by Single-Cell-Type Proximity Biotinylation and Signaling Amplification.,"Mapping the spatial proteome signature within heterogeneous tissue microenvironment of clinical specimens offers unique insights into both physiological and pathological molecular phenotypes. However, to simultaneously visualize and discover these spatial proteome features is challenging. Herein, we introduce spatial visual proteomics (SVPro) which integrates single-cell proximity biotinylation coupled with fluorescence signal amplification via the trifunctional probe. This probe uniquely combines naphthylamine-mediated radical targeting, clickable fluorescence imaging, and biotinylation-facilitated proteome capture, enabling all three within a single tissue section. Strategic PEGylation and multivalent fluorescent conjugation of these probes improves labeling and visualization efficiency and specificity. SVPro allows cell-type proteomic profiling of neuronal subpopulations in distinct mouse brain regions and amyloid-β plaques in mouse brain of Alzheimer's disease model. Notably, we identified and validated distinct marker proteins associated with amyloid‑β plaques deposited in different brain regions. SVPro therefore emerges as a robust and high-resolution spatial proteomics approach for simultaneously visualizing the spatial architecture and proteome landscapes of intact tissue microenvironment.",Zheng Z; Tang Z; Li C; Xiao H; Li Y; He A; Mao Y; Zheng J; Ke M; Gao R; Li D; Liu C; Dong Z; Tian R,"School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150001, China.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2025-11-26,10.1002/anie.202519440,4.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Tissue Microenvironment; Spatial Proteomics; Single‐cell‐type Resolution; Proximity Labeling; Trifunctional Probe

This study aimed to develop and validate a multimodal prediction model integrating clinical parameters, immunological markers, peritumoral radiomics, and habitat-based features for accurate preoperative FTC diagnosis.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective two-center study included 775 patients with pathologically confirmed follicular thyroid neoplasms (training set: n = 353; internal validation: n = 151; external validation: n = 271). Radiomics features were extracted from intratumoral regions, peritumoral extensions (1 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm), and habitat subregions identified through K-means clustering. Four machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine) were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent clinical and immunological predictors. An integrated model combining optimal radiomics signatures with clinical predictors was constructed and compared with six established thyroid imaging reporting and data systems (TIRADS). Model interpretability was enhanced through SHAP analysis and nomogram visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Multivariate analysis identified four independent predictors: thyroglobulin (TG), solid composition, hypoechoic echogenicity, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). The Peri-3mm gradient boosting machine (GBM) model achieved area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.881, 0.865, and 0.868 across cohorts. The combined Habitat GBM model demonstrated AUCs of 0.900, 0.852, and 0.860.

Additional research is needed to better stratify aSAH patients.<h4>Objectives</h4>To identify distinct clinical subphenotypes of aSAH, we applied clustering analysis using clinical, radiological, and laboratory data.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with aSAH admitted to the ICU between 2010 and 2021. K-means clustering was applied to standardized demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables collected at admission. Principal component analysis was used for dimensionality reduction and visualization. Additionally, we analyzed whether these clusters were associated with serum biomarkers (S100B, HMGB1, and TLR4) in a subset of patients.<h4>Results</h4>The study included 511 patients with aSAH. Two distinct subphenotypes were identified: a High-Risk Cluster (n = 301, 58.9 %) characterized by severe systemic complications, and higher mortality, and a Low-Risk Cluster (n = 210, 41.1 %) with less severe symptoms and better outcomes.

Current treatment for toxic exposures to diquat focuses on supportive care, and there is a need for better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying diquat-induced injury in order to develop more targeted antidotes. To this end, TGF-alpha transgenic mouse hepatocyte (TAMH) cells were exposed to various concentrations of diquat to determine toxicologically relevant concentrations followed by subsequent transcriptomic analysis. Data mining from the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC)-II dataset, which was accessed through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was also leveraged during the gene network analysis. A median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) for diquat in the TAMH line was determined to be 18 μM, with significant cell death observed at 9 h. Microarray data identified 3578 significantly altered transcripts in the TAMH model and 6554 from the MAQC-II dataset, with notable overlap in gene expression changes. Pathway analysis using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) highlighted MAPK signaling as playing a role during diquat-induced toxicity in both models, with 11 shared transcripts suggesting a conserved molecular response across rodent species. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind diquat-induced toxicity using TAMH cells and identified MAPK signaling pathway as involved. By demonstrating the utility of combining GEO and DAVID for pathway analysis, this study not only highlights potential therapeutic targets for diquat toxicity but also presents a broadly applicable, cost-effective strategy for toxicogenomic research.",Nguyen NU; Tong C; Fry MM; Stamper BD,"Peacehealth Southwest Medical Center, Vancouver, WA, USA.",Toxicology mechanisms and methods,2025-11-27,10.1080/15376516.2025.2583401,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",Liver; MAPK; Microarray; Gene Expression; Diquat
41296555,TE-SCALE: a comprehensive database for exploring transposable element expression across human cancers at single-cell resolution.,"Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive DNA sequences typically silenced in normal tissues. Their dysregulation in cancer can significantly impact oncogene activation and tumorigenesis. However, due to their repetitive nature, TEs are often excluded from gene-centric single-cell analyses. Although recent advances have enabled single-cell TE quantification, a systematic resource for exploring single-cell TE dynamics in cancer has remained lacking. To address this, we developed TE-SCALE (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/te-scale/), a single-cell database for integrative analysis and visualization of TE expression across human cancers. It incorporates over 1.3 million cells from 330 samples across 20 cancer types and 12 tissue origins. Built on our in-house pipeline scTEfinder, TE-SCALE provides a comprehensive pan-cancer TE expression atlas, enabling multi-scale exploration from tissue to cell population, supported by well-curated TE annotations. The platform offers three key analytical modules: differential TE expression, TE-gene co-expression network, and functional enrichment analysis. A user-friendly web interface supports flexible browsing, searching, analysis, and data download. Notably, TE-SCALE identifies tumor-specific TEs preferentially expressed in particular cancer types or disease states, underscoring their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring, and immunotherapeutic targeting. Collectively, TE-SCALE provides an essential resource for decoding TE biology in cancer and expedites its translation into clinical applications.",Meng X; Nie Z; Wang Q; Hu Y; Deng Y; Ai N; Huang Z; Li Y; Yuan Y; Xiao J; Zeng J; Li G; Jiang L,"China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing 100101, China.",Nucleic acids research,2025-11-26,10.1093/nar/gkaf1235,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
41312592,Design principles for enhancing a digital health platform for patients with atrial fibrillation.,"<b>Objective:</b> Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with an elevated risk of stroke, heart failure, dementia, and mortality. As its clinical consequences are strongly influenced by modifiable risk factors, this study aims to design a patient journey for individuals undergoing AF treatment, with the goal of improving patient safety and healthcare delivery. <b>Methods:</b> An empirical study was conducted using an action design research approach. The research focused on identifying and implementing design principles to enhance digital health platforms and support AF management. <b>Results:</b> The study resulted in five key design principles: (i) comprehensive requests for medical interventions, (ii) visualization of patient trajectories, (iii) prioritization of waiting lists informed by real-time data, (iv) equality and inclusion throughout the patient journey, and (v) rapid access to and visualization of quality indicators. These principles collectively address current challenges in AF care by optimizing data use, strengthening patient involvement, and improving decision-making. <b>Conclusion:</b> We propose adjustments to the design of digital health platforms for AF management based on the identified principles. Such adaptations have the potential to enhance patient safety, improve healthcare delivery, and create more efficient, inclusive, and data-driven processes in AF management.",Jóhannsdóttir LG; Erlingsdóttir HÝ; Gizurarson SÖ; Guðmundsson K; Kristjánsdóttir H; Jónsson B; Óskarsdóttir M; Islind AS,"Department of Computer Science, Reykjavík University, Reykjavík, Iceland.",Health informatics journal,2025-11-28,10.1177/14604582251401411,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Atrial fibrillation; Remote Monitoring; Continuous Quality Improvements
41316008,Optimal exercise type and dose to improve sleep quality in older adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Sleep quality decreased can result in a major health issue in older people with age. While not all sleep changes are pathological in older people's life, severe disturbances may lead to depression, cognitive impairments, deterioration of quality of life, significant stresses for careers and increased healthcare costs. Despite the known benefits of exercise for improving sleep quality, it is necessary to identify the optimal exercise type and dose.<h4>Objective</h4>This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) combined to examine evaluated the existing evidence on the effectiveness of different exercises, and to examine the dose and response relationship between overall and specific types with improving sleep quality in older people.<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and Embase were systematically searched for this review, including studies up to April 2025. Only randomized controlled trials were included. Studies involved at least one type of exercise intervention and reported changes in sleep quality assessments. To address the limitations of relying solely on statistical significance, we also calculated the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) to determine the smallest meaningful improvement in sleep quality among older people, both overall and across different exercise doses. Data analysis and visualization were conducted using the ""meta"", ""netmeta"", ""MBNMA"", and ""ggplot2"" packages in the R environment.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 62 RCTs involving 5005 older adults were included. Overall, exercise significantly improved sleep quality, with clinically meaningful improvements achieved from as early as 5 weeks of intervention. The optimal exercise type was combined aerobic and resistance training, followed by aerobic exercise, resistance training, walking, and yoga. The estimated optimal exercise dose was around 660 to 990 METs*min/week, with longer durations at 15 weeks producing the greatest benefits. Improvements were more pronounced among participants with poorer baseline sleep quality.<h4>Conclusion</h4>If older people receive the most appropriate exercise intervention, they can obtain clinically meaningful benefits of improving sleep in the elderly within the WHO guidelines for exercise doses. The results support the WHO recommendation that combine aerobic exercise and resistance training should be an important part of interventions for the older people.<h4>Protocol registration</h4>PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024566751.",Xiong Z; Yuan Y; Qiu B; Yang Y; Bai Y; Wang J; Wang T; Liu H; ShangGuan Y; Jiang S; Wang F; Ding W; Wang Z; Li Y; Zhang L,"The School of Physical Education and Health, East China Jiaotong University, Nanchang, 330013, China.",BMC geriatrics,2025-11-28,10.1186/s12877-025-06607-z,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Exercise; Older Adults; Sleep Quality; Network Meta-analysis; Dose–response
41307659,Magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia: a systematic review of the imaging protocol and diagnostic accuracy.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe pain disorder for which MRI helps to identify the anatomical causes of pain. However, imaging protocols vary widely, and a plethora of imaging features that might contribute to different forms of TN have been described. This review aims to (1) summarize current evidence on MRI techniques and their diagnostic performance, and (2) evaluate imaging markers that improve our understanding of TN pathophysiology and support clinical decision-making regarding surgical or interventional treatment.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases, yielding 1441 studies. After applying strict inclusion criteria, 140 articles were included, and three papers were added from cross-referencing.<h4>Results</h4>The review revealed that advanced MRI sequences (e.g., 3D CISS, 3D FLASH, 3D FIESTA) improve the visualization of neurovascular conflicts. Imaging at 3.0 T was found to be superior to 1.5 T for detecting small vessels responsible for nerve compression. However, distinguishing clinically significant neurovascular conflicts from asymptomatic neurovascular contacts remains a challenge. In secondary TN, MRI reliably detects lesions related to multiple sclerosis and other pathological conditions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown potential in identifying microstructural changes in the trigeminal nerve, further supporting its diagnostic use.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although MRI remains an essential tool in diagnosing TN, limitations in its diagnostic accuracy highlight the need for more homogeneous study designs and further refinement of imaging protocols and interpretation criteria.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Accurate identification of the anatomical cause of trigeminal neuralgia is clinically important, but variable MRI protocols result in inconsistent diagnostic accuracy. Findings Advanced MRI sequences and higher field strength improve visualization of neurovascular conflict, although interobserver variability and limited clinical correlation remain major challenges. Clinical relevance Standardized magnetic resonance imaging protocols and clearer interpretation criteria may enhance diagnostic confidence and assist treatment planning in patients with suspected trigeminal neuralgia, particularly when surgical intervention is considered to relieve severe, medication-resistant facial pain.",Henssen D; van Grinsven M; Vissers K; van Goethem J,"Department of Medical Imaging, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. dylan.henssen@medizin.uni-leipzig.de.",European radiology,2025-11-27,10.1007/s00330-025-12141-8,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Trigeminal neuralgia; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Systematic Literature Review; Classical Trigeminal Neuralgia

Clinical, perioperative, and pathological data were retrospectively analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>All procedures were performed laparoscopically without patient repositioning. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. The mean operative time was 101.0 ± 24.5 minutes, and mean estimated blood loss was 53 ± 27.0 mL. The median postoperative hospital stay was 4.2 ± 1.1 days. Postoperative pathology revealed Ta in 14 patients, T1 in 21 patients, and T2 in 5 patients. During a mean follow-up of 12.9 months (range, 2-24), one patient developed bladder recurrence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SP-ILS technique offers direct visualization, reproducible bladder cuff excision, and efficient single-position workflow during both LRNU and BCE.",Han X; Zhou M; Xiong M; Xiao Y; Wu Y; Jiang H; Tu M; Wu S; Hou T,"Department of Urology, Medical School, South China Hospital, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518116, China.",BMC urology,2025-11-24,10.1186/s12894-025-01979-1,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Supine Position; Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (Utuc); Intraperitoneal Laparoscopy; Radical Nephroureterectomy (Rnu); Bladder Cuff Excision (Bce); Single-position
41296970,AortaDiff: Volume-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models for Multi-Branch Aortic Surface Generation.,"Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes, they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour, ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods, including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets, and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for cardiovascular research.",An D; Du P; Wang JX; Wang C,,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2025-11-26,10.1109/tvcg.2025.3634652,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41317799,An Explainable Deep Model for Risk Scoring and Accurate Radionecrosis Identification Following Brain Metastasis Stereotactic Radiosurgery.,"<h4>Purpose/objectives</h4>As survival improves for patients with brain metastases, distinguishing local recurrence(LR) from radionecrosis(RN) is a growing neuro-oncologic challenge. We aimed to develop an explainable deep learning(DL) model to non-invasively distinguish RN from LR in patients with non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) following stereotactic radiosurgery(SRS).<h4>Materials/methods</h4>A 2<sup>nd</sup> order Heavy-Ball Neural Ordinary Differential Equation(HBNODE) DL framework was designed. It enabled dynamic tracking of input evolution within DNN, integrating MR, clinical, and genomic features into a unified Image-Genomic-Clinical(I-G-C) space. This allowed visualization of sample trajectories during model execution. Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation(LRP) was applied to quantify individual non-imaging feature contributions and their influence on diagnosis. Within the I-G-C space, a decision-making field(F) was reconstructed. The temporal evolution of F enabled quantitative comparison of cumulative contributions from each feature. Key intermediate states, defined as locoregional equilibrium points(∇F=0), were identified and aggregated using a non-parametric model to optimize prediction. High-contributing features were selected via k-means clustering of LRP results, forming a risk score model for RN vs. LR differentiation. The dataset included 142 BM lesions from 103 NSCLC patients, incorporating 3-month post-SRS T1+C MRI, seven genomic biomarkers, and seven clinical parameters. An 8:2 ratio was used for training and independent testing.<h4>Results</h4>Three high-contributing features, age(x1), ALK(x0.84) and PD-L1(x0.76) status, were identified by LRP and used to construct the risk score. The risk score model outperformed the model using all unweighted clinical/genomic features and an MR-only DNN. The HBNODE model, embedding the risk score within deep space, achieved the best performance across all metrics.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The derived risk score, based on non-imaging features, offers a simple and rapid indicator for distinguishing RN from LR. When integrated with MRI in the HBNODE model, it further enhanced predictive performance while maintaining high explainability, highlighting its potential as a clinical decision-aid tool for BM management.",Zhao J; Vaios E; Calabrese E; Yang Z; Ginn J; Gonzalez A; Floyd S; Reitman ZJ; Fecci P; Kirkpatrick J; Lafata K; Wang C,"Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2025-11-27,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.11.038,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Treatment Response; Deep Learning; Explainability; Neural Ode
41310706,"BAFF is a marker of hypogammaglobulinemia, neuroaxonal damage and inflammation in multiple sclerosis patients on ocrelizumab.","<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Serum biomarker testing for multiple sclerosis has been increasing in popularity in research and clinical practice. Little evidence is available on influences of disease modifying therapy on serum biomarker levels. Interpretation of clinically available serum biomarkers in the context of each individual patient poses a greater challenge in this context. This study focuses on correlations between clinical variables and unique profile of serum biomarkers in the context of anti-CD20 treatment by ocrelizumab.<h4>Methods</h4>A cohort of multiple sclerosis patients without relapse in the last 12 months and the following 3 months who received serum biomarker testing with the Octave MSDA (Multiple Sclerosis Disease Activity) panel of 18 biomarkers between June 2023 and June 2024 was identified at the UCI Multiple Sclerosis Center. Clinical data was collected retrospectively. Data preparation, analysis and visualization were performed using R.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 118 MS patients without recent acute inflammatory activity were included (63 untreated and 55 on ocrelizumab). Longitudinal immunoglobulin data were available for 48 patients receiving ocrelizumab. Age-adjusted analyses revealed significantly elevated B-cell activating factor (BAFF) levels in the ocrelizumab group. In these patients, BAFF correlated inversely with IgG and IgA-but not IgM-levels. IgG declined over time in patients treated with ocrelizumab, with higher BAFF levels predicting lower IgG and IgA independent of treatment duration. Patients with elevated BAFF exhibited both lower baseline IgG and a more rapid IgG decline compared to those with lower BAFF. Elevated BAFF also correlated positively with markers of neuroaxonal injury, including neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), as well as with multiple pro-inflammatory biomarkers such as osteopontin (OPN), CXCL9, CXCL13, CCL20, TRAIL-R1, and CDCP1.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study provides insight into unique biomarker profile in patients on ocrelizumab.

41316231,CO₂ angiography offers clinical advantages over iodinated contrast in endovascular aneurysm repair: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study evaluates the safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) versus iodinated contrast media (ICM) in endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), an area where comprehensive combined imaging and clinical assessments have yet to be explored.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus from their inception to May 2025, specifically targeting studies published since 2012 that compared contrast media in EVAR. Outcome measures-including operative time, fluoroscopy time, procedural success (defined as postoperative restoration of blood flow), renal function, incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and type II endoleak-were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with ICM, CO₂ angiography showed no significant differences in procedural success or operative time (both P > 0.05), while fluoroscopy duration was slightly longer (WMD = 2.75, P < 0.001). CO₂ angiography was associated with markedly reduced ICM exposure (WMD = - 57.24, P < 0.05) and showed potential renal benefits, including higher eGFR (WMD = 0.42, P < 0.001) and lower serum creatinine at 1 month (WMD = - 0.09, P = 0.04). The incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury was also lower in the CO₂ group (1.3% vs. 2.8%; OR = 0.43, P = 0.05). Moreover, CO₂ angiography showed a reduced incidence of type II endoleaks (OR = 0.57, P = 0.04), although further confirmation in larger prospective studies is warranted.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Based mainly on observational data with limited prospective studies, CO₂ angiography in EVAR shows comparable intra-procedural visualization and technical success to ICM. Some studies suggest it may reduce perioperative AKI risk or provide short-term renal protection. However, current evidence is insufficient to establish its equivalence across all patient populations. Therefore, its use should be individualized based on factors like renal function and anatomy or considered alongside low-dose ICM.",Shen G; Dai Y; Wang K; Zhang H; Xin Y; Chen Y; Li Z; Li F; Gao F,"Department of Clinical Medicine, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, PR China.",BMC surgery,2025-11-28,10.1186/s12893-025-03329-2,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Meta-analysis; CO2; Evar; Icm; Vascular Interventional Therapy
41284076,Redefining quality targets: a first-time application of an innovative graphic tool in hematology using six sigma.,"Hematology laboratories routinely face analytical challenges despite automation and standardized workflows. While Six Sigma metrics are increasingly applied in clinical chemistry, their use in hematology remains limited due to variability in Total Allowable Error (TEa) standards and lack of integrated assessment tools. This study aims to evaluate analytical performance in hematology by combining sigma metrics with an innovative graphic decision tool to guide quality control (QC) planning. A retrospective study over was conducted in a tertiary hematology lab. Internal Quality Control (IQC) and External Quality Assurance Scheme (EQAS) data for five analytes-hemoglobin, WBC, RBC, hematocrit, and platelet count-were analyzed using the Six Sigma model. TEa values were selected using a hierarchical approach based on the 2014 Milan Consensus, prioritizing biological variation, CLIA, and RCPA guidelines. A novel graphic tool was used to visualize performance zones and inform QC strategies. Sigma metrics varied across parameters and TEa sources. Hemoglobin demonstrated excellent performance (σ > 6), while hematocrit and platelet count showed sigma <3 under strict TEa. Graphic tool stratification revealed actionable insights; application of TEa optimization reclassified low-performing tests, significantly improving QC efficiency. Subsequent QGI calculations identified the predominant source of error. This study introduces a first-time application of a graphic tool in hematology for sigma visualization and QC planning. The dual-framework approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and resource utilization, offering a practical, scalable model for laboratories seeking personalized, risk-based quality management.",Rajagopal P; S A; Bharti JN; Rachagiri S; Paramasivam R,"Department of Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Mangalagiri, Andhra Pradesh, India.",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,2025-11-24,10.1080/00365513.2025.2592228,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),"Quality control; Hematology; Six Sigma; Analytical Quality Assurance; Laboratories, Clinical"
41305852,Transoral Robotic Lingual Tonsillectomy for Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Our objective was to investigate the safety and efficacy of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) lingual tonsillectomy (LT) with and without epiglottopexy and to compare it with non-robotic approaches for children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).<h4>Methods</h4>A multi-institutional retrospective chart review was conducted on 56 patients who underwent TORS LT (32 males, 24 females; mean age 11.7 ± 4.2 years; 29 syndromic) between 2015 and 2024 at 2 tertiary care pediatric hospitals. Preoperative and postoperative polysomnogram data were collected and analyzed, along with clinical and demographic data to analyze predictors of surgical success.<h4>Results</h4>Of the patients with pre- and postoperative polysomnogram, 26 patients (60.5%) were considered a surgical success. Significant improvements were seen in apnea hypopnea index (mean reduction of -14.39 ± 5.2; p = 0.0079), apnea hypopnea index during rapid eye movement (mean reduction of -25.89 ± 8.8; p = 0.0057), and O2 nadir (mean improvement of 5.73% ± 1.64%; p = 0.0012). There were no significant differences in the proportion of surgical success based on preoperative OSA severity, presence of a syndrome, or presence of obesity. Eleven patients experienced complications (19.6%), including postoperative hemorrhage requiring operative intervention (8.9%) and oropharyngeal scarring (3.6%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>For pediatric patients with OSA and lingual tonsillar hypertrophy, TORS is an effective and safe method of performing LT, with benefits including excellent 3-dimensional visualization and a greater ability to distinguish the lingual tonsil/tongue musculature interface. While this is the largest pediatric TORS LT study to date, further research with larger sample sizes and additional sleep and quality of life metrics would add to the existing literature.<h4>Level of evidence: 4</h4>",Campbell DJ; Excel D; Palmer WJ; Nardone HC; Johnston DR,"Department of Otolaryngology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.",The Laryngoscope,2025-11-26,10.1002/lary.70267,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Pediatric; obstructive sleep apnea; Lingual Tonsillectomy
41310817,Household food insecurity and its associated factors in Ethiopia: A systematic review and Meta-Analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Household food insecurity continues to be a public health concern, especially in developing countries, including Ethiopia. Despite efforts by the Ethiopian Federal Government to address food insecurity, it has persistently remained one of the top problems. The pooled prevalence of the national is crucial for interventions by clear insight for policy makers, decision makers, and planners of the country by addressing the limited evidence of the household prevalence in Ethiopia. Given the importance of addressing household food insecurity in Ethiopia, there is a growing body of research that examines its prevalence, determinants, and consequences. However, existing evidence is spread across various regions, with variability in the findings. This study aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of household food insecurity and its associated factors in Ethiopia.<h4>Methods</h4>We used PRISMA to identify eligible studies. The inclusion criteria for this study were published in English, publication year, Ethiopian studies, relevant to topics, while editorial letters, complex abstracts and difficult to obtain full texts were excluded from the eligibility criteria. The data was analyzed using STATA version 14 with random-effects model. The forest plot was used to determine the odds ratio for each study of prevalence and associated factors and the general studies with 95% CI presented. The heterogeneity among the studies was checked by I<sup>2</sup>with 95% CI and p-value. Publication bias was checked with funnel plot graphical visualization and statistically using the Egger test.<h4>Result</h4>Examination of 768 studies, ten studies involving 4734 households, and ten out of 768 published articles evaluated satisfied the inclusion criteria and were added to the systematic and meta-analysis. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of household food insecurity of 51.46 % (95% CI: 41.52%, 61.40%). However, subgroup analysis by region was performed in which the highest prevalence of household food insecurity was observed in the Amhara region (61.14% (95% CI 26.00, 68.77) while the lowest prevalence of household food insecurity was observed in the Oromia region (41.52% (95% CI 21.27, 61.78), I2 = 98.9%). Furthermore, this review, pooled factor illustrated that households with larger families were 6.43 times (OR=6.43, 95% CI: 2.98, 13.87, p=0.016, I2 =67.0%) more likely to be food insecure compared to households with small families.<h4>Conclusions</h4> In this review, the prevalence of households and more than half of the households in Ethiopia had experienced food insecurity. Therefore, the food insecurity of households in Ethiopia continues to be a public health problem. The subgroup analysis showed that the Amhara region had the highest prone region for food insecurity and the size of the family was the potential significant factor for food insecurity in the household. Strategies to reduce household food insecurity must be implemented by sharing the best food secure region with the food insecurity region, community education and improving contraceptive use to reduce the number of family sizes.

41312519,Transformer-based optical attenuation compensation and denoising in photoacoustic imaging.,"<h4>Significance</h4>Linear-array-based photoacoustic imaging (PAI) combines functional imaging with structural imaging from ultrasound. However, it suffers from depth-dependent optical attenuation due to surface illumination, resulting in decreased signal amplitude and image contrast with depth. Existing attenuation compensation methods often amplify noise, creating a trade-off between depth enhancement and image quality.<h4>Aim</h4>We aim to develop a deep learning method that addresses the coupled problem of optical attenuation compensation and denoising for linear-array-based PAI and test the applicability <i>in vivo</i>.<h4>Approach</h4>We propose a vision-transformer-based generative model to address this coupled problem. A diverse dataset was created using simulated data and experimental twin phantoms. Vascular twin phantoms were made by printing digital images onto polyurethane films to test the performance of the model. We trained and compared three deep learning architectures, Pix2Pix, Residual U-Net, and the proposed Transformer U-Net, using various loss functions, including adversarial, MSE, PSNR, SSIM, and a combined PSNR + SSIM. We tested the model on small animal tumor images.<h4>Results</h4>Quantitative evaluation shows that PSNR + SSIM loss is robust in preserving structural details and suppressing noise. Under the pre-specified SSIM + PSNR training objective, Trans U-Net achieves the highest SSIM and PSNR across noise levels on both datasets. <i>In vivo</i> validation using murine breast tumor models and <i>in vivo</i> breast imaging confirmed the model's ability to enhance visualization of deep vascular structures without introducing noise amplification.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed Trans U-Net effectively addresses the coupled problem of attenuation correction and denoising in handheld PAI.

Here, we show that the IMD is a conserved membrane structure found in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. We used two independent approaches, density gradient fractionation of membrane domains and visualization of IMD-associated proteins through fluorescence microscopy, to determine the characteristics of the plasma membrane compartmentalization in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. Proteomic analysis revealed that the IMD is enriched in metabolic enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of conserved cell envelope components such as arabinogalactan and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. Using a fluorescent protein fusion of IMD-associated proteins, we demonstrated that this domain is concentrated in the subpolar region of the rod-shaped cells, where active cell envelope biosynthesis is taking place. Proteomic analysis further revealed the enrichment of enzymes involved in synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosates and phenolic glycolipids in the IMD. We validated the IMD association of two enzymes, α1,3-fucosyltransferase and fucosyl 4-<i>O</i>-methyltransferase, which are involved in the final maturation steps of phenolic glycolipid biosynthesis. Taken together, these data indicate that functional compartmentalization of membrane is an evolutionarily conserved feature found in both <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and <i>M. smegmatis</i>, and <i>M. tuberculosis</i> utilizes this membrane location to enrich biosynthetic enzymes for its surface-exposed lipid virulence factors.IMPORTANCE<i>M. tuberculosis</i> remains an important public health threat, with more than one million deaths every year. The pathogen's ability to survive in the human host for decades highlights the importance of understanding how this bacterium regulates and coordinates its metabolism, cell envelope elongation, and growth. The IMD is a membrane structure that associates with the subpolar growth zone of actively growing mycobacterial cell, but its existence is only known in a non-pathogenic model, <i>M. smegmatis</i>. Here, we demonstrated the presence of the IMD in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, making the IMD an evolutionarily conserved plasma membrane compartment in mycobacteria. Furthermore, our study revealed that the IMD may function as the factory for synthesizing phenolic glycolipids, virulence factors produced by slow-growing pathogenic species.",Puffal J; Sparks IL; Brenner JR; Li X; Leszyk JD; Hayashi JM; Shaffer SA; Morita YS,"Department of Microbiology, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA.",mBio,2025-11-26,10.1128/mbio.02680-25,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Cell membranes; Glycolipids; membrane proteins; Lipid Synthesis; Cell Envelope
41292064,A cigarette compound-induced tumor microenvironment promotes sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma via the 14-3-3η-modified tumor-associated proteome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Sorafenib resistance is the bottleneck in the clinical treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cigarette compounds accelerate HCC progression and chemotherapy resistance by forming a chemical microenvironment. Here, we aimed to further reveal the mechanisms by which the microenvironment formed by cigarette exposure contributes to sorafenib resistance.<h4>Methods</h4>HCC cell lines and xenografted nude mice were used as experimental models. A cohort of 119 patients enrolled from the First Affiliated Hospital of Huzhou University (between Mar 2019 to Jan 2024) and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (between Jan 2018 to Jan 2024) with advanced HCC who had recurrent disease and were receiving sorafenib treatment was analyzed. The public data of the expression of genes and survival of HCC patients were all obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). The phospho/angiogenesis antibody arrays were used to identify the key phosphorylated proteins/cytokines that have been differentially modified. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to elucidate the role of key factors in regulating sorafenib resistance. Flow cytometry, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, caspase activity, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and capillary tube formation assay were employed to investigate related biological functions.<h4>Results</h4>Chronic cigarette smoking exposure continuously activated 14-3-3η via an epigenetic accumulation of DNA demethylation. This ""switch-like"" factor, 14-3-3η, upregulated its key downstream pathway, B-Raf/extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK). 14-3-3η and its regulated B-Raf/ERK protein work together, and then blocked the caspase cascade, enhancing the pro-survival ability of HCC cells. 14-3-3η/B-Raf/ERK activated nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), which in turn transcriptionally upregulated multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2), accelerating drug efflux. NF-κB also transcriptionally regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), inducing the neo-vascularization. These critical processes together resisted the HCC to sorafenib. Furthermore, these effects were blocked and sorafenib resistance was reversed when we targeted 14-3-3η with its novel chemical inhibitor, arsenic trioxide.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A cigarette compound-formed tumor microenvironment resisted HCC to sorafenib by locking the adaptor protein 14-3-3η in a constitutively active state. This outcome provided a mechanistic rationale and a translational strategy to re-sensitize HCC patients exposed to cigarette to targeted therapy.",Jin M; Du X; Dong N; Feng Z; Sun Y; Song S; Zhang H; Li M; Duan S; Lu M; Mo Q; Zhang C; Xue D; Yang X; Tang C; Li Y,"Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, School of Public Health, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350122, China.",Chinese medical journal,2025-11-26,10.1097/cm9.0000000000003851,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),"Liver neoplasms; Cigarette smoking; Sorafenib; Tumor Microenvironment; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; 14-3-3 Proteins"

All underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI at hepatobiliary phase using DL-VIBE (1.5 mm slice thickness) and conventional VIBE (3.0 mm). Blinded evaluations assessed biliary anatomy, lesion margins, and image quality through quantitative metrics (edge rise distance [ERD], CNR) and qualitative scoring.<h4>Results</h4>DL-VIBE demonstrated superior biliary visualization with 163 % higher tertiary duct detection (2.45 vs. 0.93 branches, p < 0.001) and improved continuity scores (2.97 vs. 2.60, p < 0.001). Lesion margins showed significantly improved sharpness (ERD: 0.93 ± 0.50 mm vs. 1.51 ± 0.10 mm; P < 0.001), while lesion detection rates were significantly higher overall (97.2 % vs. 91.0 %; P = 0.005) and particularly for micro lesions (96.3 % vs. 87.6 %; P = 0.004). DL-VIBE reduced image noise (3.82 vs. 2.25, p < 0.001) and suppressed ringing artifacts (3.55 vs. 2.30, p < 0.001) while maintaining bile duct CNR gains (230.50 vs. 135.14, p < 0.001), though with marginally lower texture naturalness (2.85 vs. 3.45, p = 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>DL-VIBE improves biliary microanatomy delineation, lesion margin resolution, and small lesion detection in gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary MRI, suggesting clinical utility for precision imaging within standard breath-hold durations.<h4>Clinical relevance statement</h4>DL-reconstructed 1.5-mm HBP VIBE serves as an improved alternative to conventional 3-mm VIBE, offering enhanced tertiary bile duct visualization and subcentimeter lesion detection for better clinical decision-making.",Dai H; Chen J; Liu K; Zhang M; Fu C; Nickel D; Sun W; Feng B; Chen C; Yang C; Song X; Zeng M,"Department of Radiology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; School of Health Science and Engineering, University of Shanghai For Science and Technolgy, Shanghai, China.",European journal of radiology,2025-11-24,10.1016/j.ejrad.2025.112574,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Gadoxetic Acid-enhanced Mri; Deep Learning Reconstruction; Volumetric Interpolated Breath-hold Examination (Vibe)
41313799,Spatially Resolved Mapping of Monoacylglycerol Lipase Activity in the Brain.,"Visualizing signaling systems in the brain with high spatial resolution is critical to understanding brain function and to develop therapeutics. Especially, enzymes are often regulated on the post-translational level, resulting in a disconnect between protein levels and activity. Conventional antibody-based methods have limitations, including potential cross-reactivity and the inability of antibodies to discriminate between active and inactive enzyme states. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), an enzyme degrading the neuroprotective endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, is the target of inhibitors currently in clinical trials for the treatment of several neurological disorders. To support translational and (pre)clinical studies and fully realize the therapeutic opportunities of MAGL inhibitors, it is essential to map the spatial distribution of MAGL activity throughout the brain in both health and disease. Here, we introduce selective fluorescent activity-based probes for MAGL enabling direct visualization of its enzymatic activity in lysates, cultured cells, and tissue sections. We show that oxidative stress, which inactivates MAGL through the oxidation of regulatory cysteines, reduces probe labeling, thereby validating the probes activity-dependence. Extending this approach, we developed an activity-based histology protocol to visualize MAGL activity in fresh-frozen mouse and human brain tissues. This approach revealed robust MAGL activity in astrocytes and presynaptic terminals within the mouse hippocampus and further allows detection of MAGL activity in the human cerebral cortex. Collectively, these findings establish selective activity-based probes as powerful tools mapping MAGL activity with high spatial resolution across mammalian brain tissue.",van der Vliet D; Klinkenberg AXY; Platte R; Higgins K; Prokop S; Huizenga MCW; Kraaijevanger L; van Egmond N; Straub VM; Kole MHP; Pacher P; Katona I; Huitinga I; van der Stelt M,"Department of Molecular Physiology, Leiden University, Leiden 2333 CC, The Netherlands.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2025-11-28,10.1021/acschemneuro.5c00638,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Histology; Fluorescence; Hippocampus; Microscopy; Endocannabinoid; Monoacylglycerol Lipase; Activity-based Probe
41308306,A Novel Full-percutaneous Trans-Kambin Lumbar Interbody Fusion (pTLIF) With a Large-footprint Interbody Cage: Step-by-Step Surgical Technique.,"<h4>Study design</h4>Surgical technique presentation.<h4>Objectives</h4>To introduce a novel full-percutaneous trans-Kambin transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (pTLIF) procedure for placing a large-footprint interbody cage with manual reamers and optional endoscopic foraminoplasty.<h4>Background</h4>Currently, full-endoscopic/percutaneous trans-Kambin TLIF procedures present with limitations that comprise the requirement to use endoscopic visualization during foraminoplasty; a small footprint and expensive endoscopic interbody cage; and a low surgical time-efficiency due to small and fragile disk preparation instruments. We propose a newly developed trans-Kambin approach system and instrumentation that should allow overcoming these limitations.<h4>Methods</h4>A 73-year-old female presents with persistent low-back pain, bilateral radiating pain, and neurogenic claudication. Preoperative imaging of the lumbar spine shows a spondylolisthesis at L4/L5 and degenerative disks at L3/L4 and L5/S1 with a vacuum sign and severe foraminal and central canal stenosis. Full-endoscopic/percutaneous trans-Kambin TLIF was performed at L5/S1 with a large-footprint expandable interbody cage with posterior screw fixation from L3 to S1.<h4>Results</h4>Postoperatively, the patient showed clinical and functional improvement and was discharged from the hospital after 24 hours without opioid medication. Clinical and radiologic outcome after 1 year postoperative follow-up was favorable.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel trans-Kambin procedure and instrumentation allows overcoming most limitations of current, full-endoscopic trans-Kambin fusion procedures, by allowing a time-efficient insertion of a large-footprint interbody cage with standard open-surgery disk preparation instruments under fluoroscopic control only, with optional endoscopic visualization.",Morgenstern C; Morgenstern R,"Morgenstern Institute of Spine, Centro Médico Teknon, Barcelona, Spain.",Clinical spine surgery,2025-11-27,10.1097/bsd.0000000000001952,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Percutaneous Tlif; Endoscopic Tlif; Endoscopic/percutaneous Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion; Trans-kambin Tlif; Large-footprint Interbody Cage; Trans-kambin Fusion
41286123,Automated detection of polymicrogyria in pediatric patients using deep learning.,"Polymicrogyria (PMG) is a multifaceted neurological disorder caused by abnormal cortical folding, mostly in children. It commonly results in developmental delays, seizures, and motor weakness. The mild features of PMG in neuroimaging often make its identification difficult, even for experts. In this paper, we assess the efficacy of various advanced image preprocessing strategies on the overall performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied for PMG diagnosis in MRI brain scans. We employ a pre-processing sequence that includes Min-Max normalization, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Bilateral filtering, and Canny edge detection aimed at improving the recognition of subtle features without losing essential details. The techniques can enhance the visualization of delicate structural deformities in the brain MRI images and assist in the diagnosis of neurological disorders by clinicians. Experimental results suggest that performance enhancement was achieved with all of the tested CNN architectures. ResNet-101 has exhibited the most remarkable accuracy enhancement by 10.3%. ResNet and VGG architectures delivered much greater performance improvement as compared to MobileNetV2 and DenseNet-201 models. GradCAM++ is adopted to infer the decision-making mechanism of the considered deep learning architectures. The methodology finds applications in neurological imaging and may be used to assist healthcare providers in the diagnosis of polymicrogyria. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of image pre-processing techniques in increasing the capabilities of deep learning frameworks to assist with complex tasks in medical image analysis.",Guha S; Bhandage V; Agarwal A,"Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.",Scientific reports,2025-11-24,10.1038/s41598-025-25572-6,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Polymicrogyria; Deep Learning; Mri Images; Cortical Structures; Resnet-101; Resnet-50; Densenet-201; Vgg-16; Mobilenetv2

41318225,"Clinical Utility of FAPI PET/CT in Diagnosis, Staging, and Response Assessment of Colorectal Cancer.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most common and deadly malignancies worldwide. Accurate diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring are critical for optimizing patient outcomes. Although <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT is widely utilized in CRC imaging, its diagnostic accuracy can be limited by variable avidity across histologic subtypes and by physiological bowel uptake. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted positron emission tomography (FAPI PET/CT) has recently emerged as a promising molecular imaging modality that visualizes cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor microenvironment. Compared with FDG, FAPI PET/CT provides markedly improved tumor-to-background contrast and higher sensitivity in detecting both primary and metastatic CRC lesions. Beyond its diagnosis and staging utility, FAPI PET/CT offers valuable potential for therapy guidance, treatment response assessment, and prognostic evaluation. Integration with theranostic approaches further enables a comprehensive ""see-and-treat""paradigm. FAPI PET/CT represents a transformative advance in CRC management, offering high-contrast, noninvasive visualization of tumor-stroma interactions and facilitating personalized treatment strategies.

41308386,Lasiodin sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cancer to sorafenib via SNARE complex disruption.,"<h4>Background</h4>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy arising from hepatocytes. In the clinical management of HCC, suboptimal therapeutic responses are frequently observed, which are closely associated with reduced overall survival rates. Pharmacological modulation of autophagic pathways represents a promising therapeutic strategy to resensitize tumor cells to targeted agents. Lasiodin (LAS) is a diterpenoid with antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the role of LAS in autophagy in HCC cells has not been investigated.<h4>Purpose</h4>To elucidate the specific mechanism by which LAS inhibits autophagy in HCC cells and investigate its impact on the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib.<h4>Methods</h4>We evaluated the effects of LAS on the proliferation and growth of HCC cells through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, apoptosis assay, and cell-cycle analyses. To investigate the specific molecular mechanisms by which LAS regulates autophagy in HCC cells, we employed western blotting, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) dequenching assay, LysoTracker™ analyses, assessment of autophagic flux, confocal microscopy for LC3 visualization, and transmission electron microscopy for autophagosome visualization. Finally, an HCC xenograft model was established to assess the regulatory effects of LAS on tumor-cell sensitivity to sorafenib in vivo.<h4>Results</h4>LAS inhibited the growth and proliferation of HCC cells and induced apoptosis and blocked the G2/M phase in HCC cells. LAS could inhibit autophagy and suppress the generation of autophagic vesicles in HCC cells. It inhibited autophagy initiation by inhibiting the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, while simultaneously hindering the fusion of autophagic vesicles with lysosomes by interfering with the mTOR-mediated formation of SNARE complexes, thereby inhibiting autophagy in HCC cells without affecting the number and function of lysosomes. Moreover, it enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib by inhibiting sorafenib-induced autophagy in vitro and in vivo.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We identified an autophagic inhibitor that may serve as a novel therapeutic agent for HCC, potentially opening new avenues in the landscape of HCC treatment.",Lian M; Zhang Y; Huang J; Wang D; Cao L; Li X; Tang D; Niu N; Li Y; Li J; Yu C; Xiang X,"Institute of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic-Intestinal Disease, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong 637100, China; Institute of Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong 637100, China.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2025-11-24,10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157603,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Hepatocellular carcinoma; Autophagy; Sorafenib; Lasiodin
41287057,Continuous versus interrupted epineural repair in forearm nerve injuries.,"<h4>Background</h4>Peripheral nerve repair traditionally employs interrupted suture techniques, but continuous suturing may offer advantages in operative efficiency without compromising outcomes. We compared functional recovery and surgical parameters between continuous and interrupted epineural repair techniques in forearm nerve injuries.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed 78 patients with acute forearm nerve injuries (median, radial, ulnar) treated between 2017 and 2020. Patients underwent primary epineural repair using either continuous (n = 40, 51.3%) or interrupted (n = 38, 48.7%) suture techniques. All procedures utilized 7-0 or 8-0 nylon sutures under microscopic visualization. Functional recovery was assessed using Highet-Zachary classification at minimum 12-month follow-up. Primary endpoints included motor/sensory recovery and operative duration. Secondary endpoints: operative times (isolated neurorrhaphy and total) and subgroup analyses by nerve type, injury level, and concomitant vascular repair.<h4>Results</h4>Demographics were comparable between groups (mean age 30.4 ± 11.1 years, 89.7% male). Distribution included ulnar (46.2%), median (30.4%), and radial (23.1%) nerve injuries. Mean follow-up was 37.8 ± 18.1 months. Continuous suture technique significantly reduced operative time compared to interrupted technique (59.3 ± 9.8 vs 96.1 ± 12.3 min, p < 0.001). Functional outcomes showed no significant differences between groups, with successful nerve recovery (≥ M3 motor, ≥ S3 sensory) achieved in 94.9% of continuous group and 94.7% of interrupted group patients. Subgroup analyses confirmed similar results across nerve types, injury levels, and in the presence/absence of vascular repair.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Continuous epineural suture technique achieves equivalent functional outcomes to conventional interrupted repair while significantly reducing operative time by approximately 38%.

41316101,The research progress on the application of ICG fluorescence imaging in robotic D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer: a narrative review.,"Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignant tumor worldwide. Adequate and systematic lymph node dissection not only aids in the accurate staging of gastric cancer but has also been shown to significantly improve the long-term prognosis of patients. In recent years, the use of the da Vinci Surgical System has become increasingly popular in radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer due to its high-definition three-dimensional vision, flexible robotic arm system, and advantages in fine dissection. However, due to the complex anatomy and rich blood supply of the stomach, achieving a thorough D2 lymph node dissection while ensuring surgical safety remains a technical challenge and research hotspot in robotic gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a fluorescent tracer dye approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for in vivo use. In recent years, ICG has seen increased application in gastrointestinal surgery due to its excellent tissue penetration and lymph node visualization capabilities. However, clinical research on the application of ICG in robotic-assisted radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer, particularly in D2 lymph node dissection, is still limited.

The defect-to-diaphragm ratio (DDR) was calculated from measured sizes of the diaphragm and defect. We assessed the correlation between DDR and intraoperative Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Study Group (CDHSG) classification, investigated the prognostic value of DDR for neonatal mortality, and compared its predictive performance with that of observed/expected total fetal lung volume (o/e TFLV), percentage of predicted lung volume (PPLV), and observed/expected lung-to-head ratio (o/e LHR).<h4>Results</h4>Ninety fetuses with LCDH underwent diaphragmatic 3D reconstruction and DDR measurement. The prenatal 3D MRI-based CDHSG classification showed substantial agreement with the intraoperative CDHSG classification (weighted kappa = 0.829; p < 0.001). Higher DDR was associated with lower neonatal survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis. The DDR (AUC = 0.919; 95% CI: 0.862-0.977) demonstrated comparable predictive value to other imaging indicators, including o/e TFLV (AUC = 0.905; 95% CI: 0.846-0.965), PPLV (AUC = 0.884; 95% CI: 0.814-0.953), and o/e LHR (AUC = 0.881; 95% CI: 0.812-0.951), in predicting neonatal mortality.<h4>Conclusion</h4>3D MRI reconstruction enables visualization and quantitative assessment of diaphragmatic defects in fetuses with CDH. DDR is a valuable predictor of neonatal mortality and may aid prenatal risk stratification.<h4>Key points</h4>Question The lack of an objective prenatal method for assessing diaphragmatic defect severity in CDH is addressed through 3D fetal MRI reconstruction. Findings The DDR obtained from 3D MRI correlates with intraoperative CDHSG classification and is a significant predictor of neonatal mortality.

The survey included both Likert-scaled and open-ended questions. Flow diagrams were used to depict changes in attractiveness throughout medical school. Network visualization mapped the connections between the most important career determinants. Regression analysis assessed the factors associated with career preferences. Among 364 medical students included, the most attractive careers at the end of medical school were the specialized disciplines of inpatient care (37%) and outpatient care (20%). These specialties were preferred due to interest in surgery or specialization. During the master's program, attractiveness of general practice, specialized outpatient care, and specialized inpatient care increased while the attractiveness of outpatient gynecology/pediatrics and inpatient general internal medicine decreased. Career characteristics perceived to be the most important determinants of career choice were primarily performing medical activities, part-time work, and relationships with patients. The most prevalent factors favoring career decisions were experience during the elective year (91%) and clinical courses with patient contact during the studies (70%). Students who found a career more attractive during their studies were more likely to prefer that career at the end of medical school. Career preferences at the end of medical school were associated with specific factors. Among these factors, the most significant was the perceived attractiveness of the career during medical education. This emphasizes the importance of medical education in shaping students' dynamic and multifaceted career decisions.",Di Gangi S; Inauen M; Markun S; Senn O,"Institute of Primary Care, University of Zurich, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",Medical education online,2025-11-30,10.1080/10872981.2025.2592434,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Undergraduate Medical Education; Medical Specialties; Career Preferences; Student Perception; Career Interests
41289210,An Alternate Method to Assess the Movement of Velum in a Clinical Setup.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Accurate evaluation of velum movement is important in the assessment of velopharyngeal function. Traditional phonation-based tasks can pose challenges for individuals with compromised phonatory subsystems. Identifying alternative, reliable tasks for visualizing velum movement is important for clinical assessment and intervention planning. The objective of the study is to determine whether a forced expiration task (FET) elicits greater velum movement compared to a phonation task (PT) during oral motor examination, using direct oral visualization.<h4>Method</h4>The study included 100 participants (50 males, 50 females) aged 18-70 years, excluding individuals with craniofacial anomalies, neurologic disorders, or conditions affecting velar function. Participants performed two tasks: phonation (""ah"" repeated five times) and a FET (inhalation through the nose and forced exhalation through the mouth). Audio-video recordings were evaluated by three experienced speech-language pathologists using a 5-point scale for velum movement effectiveness. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare scores between the two tasks. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess gender differences. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).<h4>Results</h4>Velum movement was significantly greater during FET compared to the PT (Z = -7.051, p < 0.001), with a large effect size (r = 0.705). No significant gender differences were found for either task. Inter-rater reliability was moderate to good (ICC = 0.703).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The forced expiration task was more effective than the phonation task in producing visible velum movement during oral motor examination. This task may serve as a practical alternative in assessing patients with limited phonatory ability and may enhance clinical assessment protocols for velopharyngeal function.",Lokheshwar S; Lokheshwar A; Rk C; Mandal K,,Folia phoniatrica et logopaedica : official organ of the International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics (IALP),2025-11-25,10.1159/000549702,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41287349,Ferroptosis-Impelled NIR Cyanine Dyes in Situ Generation Enabled Zero-Background Fluorescence Imaging and Precise Surgical Tumor Excision.,"The diagnostic accuracy of fluorescence imaging enabled lesion site visualization and pathological biomarker quantification is often compromised by non-specific probe activation and ""high-background"" fluorescence interference, which contribute to false-positive signals and reduced signal-to-noise ratio, ultimately limiting clinical reliability. Herein, we propose a ""zero-background"" fluorescence imaging strategy for precise quantification and evaluation of hydroxyl radical (·OH) levels in sorafenib-provoked ferroptotic tumor. This study utilizes endogenous ·OH generated during tumorous ferroptosis as biocatalyst, triggering the heterogenous dimerization of monomers for directly in-situ formulating near-infrared (NIR) emissive cyanine dyes. The octadecyl-substituted monomer (Cy420) demonstrated morphological variations from orbicular to square nano-assemblies modulated with serum albumin and realized the targeted and prolonged retention in tumors facilitated with the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Crucially, the in situ generated NIR dye (mCy849) forms a shielding effect via hydrophobic bis-octadecyl chain-driven self-assembly, thus resisting molecular oxidation and ensuring quantification accuracy. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that Cy420 enables accurate zero-background NIR imaging in sorafenib-administrated xenograft hepatic tumor, with significantly enhanced tumor-to-background ratio (TBR 13.2 ± 0.74) at 72 h, competently empowered NIR fluorescence-navigated precise tumor resection. Our strategy has provided a new paradigm for chemotherapy-imaging synergistic regulation of tumors with authentic ""zero-background"" fluorescence.",Xie X; Lu Z; Kong Y; Jin C; Sun Z; Yang X; Li Z; Qu F; Tan W,"Key Laboratory of Life-Organic Analysis of Shandong Province, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Qufu Normal University, Qufu, 273165, P.R.

41294350,"Developing a recombinase-aided amplification method combined with a lateral flow dipstick assay for rapid triplex detection of bovine coronavirus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus.","To establish a sensitive, simple rapid method for detecting bovine coronavirus (BCoV), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) was used to amplify template DNA or cDNA, and a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) was used to interpret the results after amplification was completed. Seventy-three rectal and nasal bovine samples were tested to evaluate the performance of the RAA-LFD assay and were tested in parallel via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for comparison. The triplex RAA-LFD assay was completed within 20 min at 39°C. This method demonstrated reasonable specificity, with no cross-reactivity to bovine norovirus (BNoV), bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3), or bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). The detection thresholds for IBRV, BVDV, and BCoV are 3.20 × 10<sup>3</sup> copies/μL, 2.21 × 10<sup>3</sup> copies/μL, and 4.13 × 10<sup>3</sup> copies/μL, respectively. Triplex RAA-LFD practicality was tested on 73 rectal and nasal bovine swabs from diarrheic cattle on commercial farms. Compared with RT-qPCR, the triplex RAA-LFD assay yielded a clinical sensitivity of 98.41%, 80.00%, and 85.71%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100.00%, and kappa coefficients of 0.94, 0.88, and 0.91 for BCoV, IBRV, and BVDV, respectively. Compared with PCR, it achieved 100.00%, 75.00%, and 87.50% sensitivity; 41.94%, 75.00%, and 58.33% PPV; and 0.33, 0.73, and 0.65 kappa coefficients for BCoV, IBRV, and BVDV, respectively. A triplex RAA-LFD method was developed to simultaneously detect BCoV, IBRV, and BVDV, offering an efficient solution for identifying multiple cattle viral pathogens.IMPORTANCEThis study developed a triplex RAA-LFD assay for the simultaneous detection of BCoV, IBRV, and BVDV. The method demonstrated high sensitivity (detection limits: 10³ copies/μL), specificity (no cross-reactivity with related viruses), and speed (20 min, including amplification and visualization). Clinical validation with 73 bovine samples showed strong agreement with RT-qPCR (kappa coefficients: 0.88-0.94), supporting its reliability. Compared with that of PCR, the sensitivity of this method remains high although the PPV varies. This rapid, low-cost, field-deployable assay improves surveillance of co-infections in cattle, aiding timely diagnosis and disease management, particularly in resource-limited settings.",Ma Y; Wang X; Chen R; Dong K; Yu X; Li N; Yang L; Zhong Q; Yao G; Ma X,"College of Veterinary Medicine, Xinjiang Agricultural University, Urumqi, China.",Microbiology spectrum,2025-11-26,10.1128/spectrum.01628-25,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Bovine viral diarrhea virus; Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis Virus; Bovine Coronavirus; Lateral Flow Dipstick; Triplex Recombinase-aided Amplification
41285152,Interdisciplinary Collaborative Virtual Reality Planning for Chest Wall Resection and Reconstruction for Sarcoma and Other Large Chest Wall Malignancies Enhanced by Automated AI Segmentation: A Retrospective Comparative Analysis.,"Oncologic chest wall resection and reconstruction present significant surgical challenges due to the complex interplay of anatomical and physiological factors. Ensuring adequate oncologic margins while preserving structural integrity and function is essential for optimal oncological and physiological patient outcomes. Advanced visualization technologies such as virtual reality (VR) are being increasingly investigated for surgical use cases because of their ability to provide a comprehensive and immersive representation of anatomical structures, thereby enhancing preoperative planning and, potentially, intraoperative guidance. The goal of this study is to establish a streamlined workflow using state-of-the-art technology to optimize surgical planning and potentially improve patient outcomes in the complex field of chest wall reconstruction.Eight cases of complex chest wall resection were retrospectively analyzed using the ""Medical Imaging XR"" VR platform with AI-driven anatomical auto segmentation. An interdisciplinary team of surgeons collaboratively planned the surgical procedures in VR, and predicted parameters such as resection extent, defect dimensions, and reconstruction strategies. These were then quantitatively compared with actual intraoperative findings. User experience was assessed with the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), workspace perception ratings, and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ).In 3 cases (37.5%), the actual resection exceeded the VR-predicted extent due to underestimated tumor infiltration. Planning exceeded resection in 50% of cases by up to 24% and one case (12.5%) showed a large overestimation in VR. UEQ scores showed high hedonic quality (Stimulation = 2.19, Novelty = 2.69) and positive pragmatic usability (Efficiency = 1.13, Dependability = 1.63). Workspace perception was favorable (mean 4.9/6), and cybersickness remained low.AI-enhanced VR planning enables interdisciplinary collaboration and can improve spatial understanding in complex chest wall surgery. Although it facilitates structured preoperative planning and communication, it should be viewed as a complementary tool to select the surgical strategy rather than as a definitive predictor of the extent of resection. Limitations in imaging resolution and segmentation accuracy can lead to under- or overestimation of tumor boundaries. Further development and clinical validation are necessary to determine its full impact on surgical planning quality and outcomes.",Schnorr P; Bedetti B; Wynands J; Koob S; Menghesha H; Buermann J; Zalepugas D; Arensmeyer J; Schmidt J; Feodorovici P,"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Helios Hospital Bonn Rhein-Sieg, Bonn, Germany.",Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,2025-11-24,10.1055/a-2727-1789,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41298110,Prospective MR Evaluation of Endolymphatic Hydrops at Multiple Flip Angles Using Single-Dose Gadolinium Contrast.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Technical advancements in inner ear MRI promise improved diagnosis and management of Ménière disease (MD), but a key challenge in optimizing 3D-FLAIR protocols for inner ear imaging lies in selecting the optimal flip angle. This study evaluates the 3 most common flip angle parameters used in 3D-FLAIR imaging for MD through a prospective, head-to-head comparison of image quality at constant flip angle (CFA) 120<sup>°</sup>, CFA 140<sup>°</sup>, and variable flip angle (VFA) obtained 4 hours after IV administration of a single-dose gadolinium-based contrast agent.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We prospectively enrolled 16 consecutive patients at our institution's otology clinic on the basis of the 2015 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery criteria for MD, including acute or fluctuating symptoms of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, or aural fullness. Each patient underwent delayed inner ear MRI at 3T with the 3 most commonly used flip angles: CFA 120°, CFA 140°, and VFA. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were determined for each flip angle. Assessment of blood-labyrinthine barrier (BLB) permeability, utricle-saccule discrimination, and endolymphatic hydrops (EH) was performed by 2 head and neck neuroradiologists.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-one ears were analyzed. One ear was excluded on the basis of a prior history of left labyrinthectomy after failed medical management of MD. There were 17 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic ears determined by clinical and hearing evaluation. The SNR of the perilymphatic space and CNR of the endolymphatic space were significantly higher at CFA 140<sup>°</sup>, followed by CFA 120<sup>°</sup>, and then VFA (<i>P</i> < .05). There was significantly improved visualization of EH, the utricle-saccule complex, and BLB permeability at CFA 140<sup>°</sup> (<i>P</i> < .05), with excellent interobserver agreement (κ > 0.80).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study demonstrates that 3D-FLAIR inner ear imaging using CFA 140<sup>°</sup> and single-dose IV gadolinium contrast at 3T is a reliable method for detecting EH.",Pham N; Kullar P; Fischbein N; Malik S; Landegger LD; Fu F; Blevins N,"From the Department of Radiology (N.P., N.F.

40334098,Novel Near Infrared Dyes Targeting Carbonic Anhydrase IX for Fluorescence Imaging Applications.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Fluorescence tumor-targeted imaging is a sensitive technique that may assist surgeons to remove residual cancer tissue during resection. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a tumor-associated cell-surface glycoprotein, upregulated in hypoxic environments, and a suitable biomarker to develop targeted dyes for fluorescence-guided surgery. This study describes design, synthesis, in vitro and in vivo assessment of novel CAIX-targeting fluorescent probes based on the well-known drug acetazolamide, addressing the contribution of both targeting moiety and fluorophore structure on imaging efficacy.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>All the CAIX-targeting heptamethine cyanines synthesized and described in the present work were characterized in terms of their optical properties in different media. The affinity to human serum albumin was evaluated by UV-VIS spectrophotometry. The affinity to the CA catalytic site was determined on a recombinant bovine CAII enzyme (bCAII), with a fluorescent-based assay. Human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, highly expressing CAIX, were used for the in vitro characterization, including cell binding, uptake and competition assays, by flow cytometry. Finally, the in vivo tumor targeting efficacy of a selected group of probes was assessed by Optical Imaging in a mouse subcutaneous tumor from HT-29 cells, characterized by both expression of CAIX and a hypoxic tumor microenvironment.<h4>Results</h4>First, a family of CAIX-targeting probes was prepared by functionalizing a novel glucamine-bearing heptamethine cyanine (Dye1) with a modified acetazolamide moiety, whose acetyl group was replaced with i) aminooctanoic acid C8 , ii) phenylalanine, iii) amino-PEG2-acid and iv) the longer linker 4a , or 2 commercially available benzenesulfonamides. From the in vitro screening of this first group of compounds, the C8-AZA targeting moiety was selected due to its highest affinity. Indeed, Dye1-C8-AZA exhibited the lowest K D values for both bCAII (6.1 ± 1.6 nM) and CAIX-expressing HT-29 cells (58 ± 9 nM), even lower than HypoxyFluor-1 (HF-1), a CAIX-targeted dye already reported in the literature. Then, other heptamethine cyanines (Dye2-Dye5, linear or cyclic, with different substituents on the indolenines and different conjugation position of the targeting vector) were functionalized with C8-AZA and fully characterized both in vitro and in vivo , to evaluate the combinatory effect of vector and fluorophore on the performance of the resulting probes. The different chemical features of the cyanines influenced the optical properties, solubility, binding with albumin, biodistribution, and imaging efficacy of the probes, while leaving unaffected the high affinity to the target. When tested in vivo for the visualization of CAIX-expressing HT-29 tumors, all C8-AZA probes showed high and specific tumor accumulation, often superior to HF-1.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Several CAIX-targeting probes were synthesized to test the combinatory effect of different molecular vectors and dyes on the biological properties. All probes containing the C8-AZA targeting moiety displayed higher affinity and specificity to the target, while imaging efficacy in vivo was strongly influenced also by the structure of the labelling dye. All probes, and among them especially Dye1-C8-AZA, displayed efficient in vivo tumor accumulation. These results support further studies toward clinical testing of CAIX as suitable target for tumor fluorescence imaging and pave the way for future clinical applications.",Napolitano R; Adamo A; Biondi L; Cordaro A; Iaboni M; Stummo F; La Cava F; Arena F; Faletto D; Chianale F; Reitano E; Poggi L; Blasi F,"From Bracco Imaging S.p.A., Milan, Italy.",Investigative radiology,2025-12-01,10.1097/rli.0000000000001204,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Hypoxia; Tumor; Carbonic anhydrase; fluorescence imaging; tumor targeting; Personalized Medicine; Near-infrared Fluorescence; Fluorescence-guided Surgery; Caix; Heptamethine Cyanines
41310660,Measurement of three-dimensional facial changes after orthodontic extraction: a retrospective longitudinal study.,"<h4>Background</h4>This study aimed to assess the three-dimensional facial morphological changes and acquire quantitative relationship between facial landmarks and zygion point to analyze the overall facial soft tissue impact of extraction and non-extraction orthodontic treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 21 extraction (19.5 ± 9.2 years) and 21 non-extraction (26.2 ± 9.1 years) versus consecutive patients were enrolled. The pretreatment and posttreatment 3D facial scans were captured using the FaceSCAN3D optical system. After establishing the coordinate system and manually placing landmark, fourteen linear and twelve angular measurements were obtained. Additionally, sixteen projection distances between landmarks and the Zygion point were measured. Color-coded displacement maps were conducted through surface registration for visualization and qualitatively assessed facial changes.<h4>Results</h4>In extraction group, inter-cheek width (2.60 ± 5.64 mm, P = 0.050) and mouth width (1.92 ± 3.89 mm, P = 0.040) increased, while upper lip fullness (-0.88 ± 1.11 mm, P = 0.003), lower lip fullness(-0.55 ± 1.21 mm, P = 0.050), and Li-N'-Pg' angle (-1.55 ± 1.09°, P < 0.001) decreased (T1-T0). As for quantitative measurements, the backward movement of landmarks in paranasal area (bilateral Al [nasal ala]: -1.14 ± 1.84 mm and -1.14 ± 1.47 mm, P = 0.010 and P = 0.002, respectively; bilateral Subal [subnasal ala]: -1.23 ± 2.18 mm and -1.25 ± 1.46 mm, P = 0.018 and P = 0.001, respectively) was observed. In the cheek area, significant changes were found in: left Ck-i [cheek-inner]: -1.40 ± 2.18 mm, P = 0.008; right Ck-m (cheek-middle): -2.32 ± 2.71 mm, P = 0.001), right Ck-o [cheek-outer]: -2.65 ± 4.05 mm, P = 0.007). In the lip area, changes were noted in: (bilateral Chp [chresta philtri]: P < 0.001, bilateral Ch [cheilion]: P < 0.001, Ls (labrale superius]: P = 0.002, Stm [stomion]: P < 0.001, and Li [labrale inferius]: P = 0.002. All changes observed were measured relative to the Zygion point in extraction group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study reveals the effects of extraction and non-extraction treatments on the lip, cheek and paranasal areas. Significant differences were found in the linear and angular measurements. The lower lip retraction was more pronounced in the extraction group. A new quantitative method for measuring facial landmarks was established. Inward and downward movement of facial landmarks was observed after extraction treatment.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The protocol of this study (PKUSSIRB-202392145) was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Chictr.org.cn) with the identifier ChiCTR2000034288 (01/07/2020).",Wu W; Wang Y; Lu W; Yan J; Teng J; Nie L; Tang Y; Han B; Chen S; Zhang Y; Liang W; Liu X; Zhang Y,"Department of Orthodontics, Cranial-Facial Growth and Development Center, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, No.22, Zhongguancun South Avenue, Haidian District, Beijing, 100081, People's Republic of China.",Head & face medicine,2025-11-27,10.1186/s13005-025-00541-6,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Extraction; soft tissue; Orthodontic Treatment; Three‐dimensional Scan
41289562,Challenges in Developing a Patient-Reported Symptom-Based Risk Stratification System for Suspected Head and Neck Cancer: Protocol for a Qualitative Case Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Symptom Input Clinical (SYNC) system is being developed to enhance the timely reporting of head and neck cancer symptoms and ensure that high-risk patients receive faster diagnoses. A key feature of the system is a digital questionnaire co-designed with patient representatives to accommodate varying levels of digital literacy. The system integrates a validated algorithm that assigns risk scores to categorize cases as low or high risk and a dashboard that supports clinicians by providing them with patient reports. However, the development process has encountered challenges that necessitate a systematic evaluation of the process, roles, and experiences of team members.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to identify challenges faced during development, how these challenges were addressed, and the implications for future digital health innovations.<h4>Methods</h4>A qualitative single-case study approach will be used following the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines focusing on individuals involved in the SYNC system's development. Participants will be selected using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling to ensure diverse perspectives, using meeting minutes and recommendations from key stakeholders. A total of 8 to 12 participants will be interviewed, representing clinical, research, and IT roles. Data collection will involve semistructured interviews, which will be conducted through Microsoft Teams. The interviews are expected to last between 40 and 60 minutes each. These interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using framework analysis in Dedoose. The actor-network theory will guide the analysis by mapping interactions between human and nonhuman actors, such as developers, clinicians, and technological tools, to understand how they influenced the project's outcomes. Participant confidentiality will be maintained through data encryption, deidentification, and secure storage.<h4>Results</h4>We anticipate identifying key barriers and facilitators in the SYNC system's development, including technical, organizational, and collaboration-related challenges. The findings are expected to provide a detailed account of the challenges encountered, such as delays, security concerns, and coordination issues; an insight into how these challenges were mitigated; and lessons learned and recommendations for improving digital health technology development, including best practices for co-design, technical integration, and stakeholder engagement.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This case study will provide valuable insights into the complexities of developing digital health technologies, particularly in collaborative, multistakeholder environments.

41318483,A multiple criteria framework for value-based assessment of health care services applied to a radiology case.,"Traditionally, value-based health care assessment initiatives have: (1) not explicitly evaluated value; (2) been complex (which limits reproducibility) and not admitted customization; and 4) not operationalized value in a way that addresses the concerns of the involved stakeholders. This research developed a four-step framework for value-based assessment of health care services that aims to overcome these limitations. The development of the framework was supported by a case study conducted in the radiology department of the second largest general hospital in Portugal and involved the participation of administrators, physicians, radiographers, and patients, and incorporates several Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis methods. A set of 160 indicators to assess the value of radiology departments was identified in the literature and synthesized into 7 value-assessment dimensions. The framework considers specific indicators for each stakeholder type and suggests customizable ways to determine the benefit of the service. Additionally, we determined the value of the radiology department (considering benefits perceived by stakeholders and direct clinical costs) and propose a dashboard to monitor its evolution. The developed management tool enables an explicit valuation of the department and uncovers service features that need to be improved. If its use is continued, it will report the evolution of the department. The framework can easily be adapted to other hospitals or departments or be used by researchers as a basis for the development of other models.",Moreira A; Rego N; Crispim J,"Centro Hospitalar Universitário São João, Alameda Prof. Hernâni Monteiro, Porto, 4200-319, Portugal.",BMC health services research,2025-11-29,10.1186/s12913-025-13288-2,1.5,dashboard(abstract),Value-based Healthcare; Value Assessment Framework; Value-based Radiology; Performance Indicators In Radiology
