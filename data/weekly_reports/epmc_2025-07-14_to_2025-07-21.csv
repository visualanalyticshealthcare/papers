40666161,"Clear Vision, Clear Savings: Enhancing Efficiency in Minimally Invasive Surgery.","<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) offers faster recovery and smaller incisions but is limited by persistent visualization issues such as lens fogging, debris, and camera instability. These challenges compromise surgical performance, increase complications, and elevate healthcare costs. This review evaluates the clinical and economic impact of suboptimal visualization in MIS and explores potential solutions.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review was conducted using peer-reviewed literature from January 1990 to August 2024. Studies included those examining visualization challenges in laparoscopic and robotic MIS, clinical outcomes, surgeon-reported frustrations, and cost analyses. Exclusion criteria included studies with significant conflicts of interest, especially those funded by medical device companies.<h4>Results</h4>Surgeons spend an estimated 40% of MIS operating time under suboptimal visual conditions, contributing to nearly 20% of surgical complications. Lens cleaning adds $132-$493 per procedure, averaging $312.53 based on 9.7 cleaning events per case. Visualization-related complications contribute an additional $251 per case. Combined, these issues result in over $2.2 billion in annual costs in the U.S. Poor visualization also disrupts workflow, increases surgeon fatigue, and hinders integration of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Suboptimal visualization in MIS stands to significantly affect patient safety and healthcare costs. Addressing these challenges through standardized cleaning protocols, improved surgeon training, and adoption of advanced technologies-including AI-driven imaging-is essential. Enhancing visualization is not just a technical upgrade but a critical step toward safer, more efficient, and cost-effective surgical care.",Dhingra J; Beinart N; Ahmed A; Patel M; Ameerah A; Srinivasan M; Idelson CR; Uecker JM,"The College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.

40669045,Identifying Design Requirements for an Interactive Physiotherapy Dashboard With Decision Support for Clinical Movement Analysis of Musicians With Musculoskeletal Problems: Qualitative User Research Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Performance-related musculoskeletal disorders are common among musicians, requiring precise diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Physiotherapists face unique challenges due to the complex relationship between musculoskeletal health and the demands of musical performance. Traditional methods often lack the necessary precision for this specialized field. Integrating clinical movement analysis (CMA) with clinical decision support (CDS) could improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcomes by offering detailed biomechanical insights and facilitating data-driven decision-making.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to identify design requirements for an interactive dashboard that aids clinical decision-making by incorporating CMA to assist physiotherapists in managing musculoskeletal disorders in musicians.<h4>Methods</h4>A qualitative user research study was conducted, using human factors engineering methods from problem-driven research, user-centered design, and decision-centered design. Data collection included a domain-specific literature review, workflow observations, and focus group discussions with domain experts, including 4 physiotherapist experts and an expert for clinical reasoning and applied biomechanics. This qualitative data was triangulated to characterize the domain, identify the CMA workflow, user needs, key cognitive tasks, and decision requirements. These insights were translated into concrete design requirements.<h4>Results</h4>A workflow for integrating musician-specific CMA into physiotherapy was established. In total, 21 user requirements, 7 key cognitive tasks, and 5 key decision requirements were defined, along with 49 design seeds. Key features identified include (1) efficient integration of musician-specific biomechanical findings into therapy, (2) combining heterogeneous data types for holistic assessment, (3) providing an adaptive overview of patient-related information, (4) using adequate visual representations and interaction techniques, (5) facilitating efficient visual-interactive analysis of findings and treatment results, and (6) enabling preparation and export of therapy findings and analysis results. Additionally, 14 CDS recommendations and 11 technical prerequisites were identified. These requirements guide the design of an interactive tool featuring advanced visualization, interactive data exploration capabilities, and contextual integration of clinical and biomechanical data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>An interactive physiotherapy dashboard with CDS incorporating CMA data holds significant potential to enhance decision-making in physiotherapy for musicians with performance-related musculoskeletal disorders. By addressing cognitive demands and integrating advanced visualization techniques, the tool can support physiotherapists in making more accurate assessments, potentially improving patient outcomes, reducing injury recurrence, and supporting musicians' career longevity. Ongoing research is essential to refine such a tool and validate its usability, decision support, and clinical effectiveness. Future work should explore advanced analytics, adapt to various CMA systems, and expand applications across musicians and therapeutic domains to enhance its impact.",Wolf E; Morisse K; Meister S,"Health Informatics, Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Witten/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany.",JMIR human factors,2025-07-16,10.2196/65029,9.9,"visualization(abstract); dashboard(title,abstract); visual(abstract); clinical decision support(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Physical Therapy; User-centered Design; Clinical Decision Support; Human Factors Engineering; Requirements Engineering; Performance-related Musculoskeletal Disorders; Decision-centered Design; Clinical Movement Analysis; Problem-driven Research; Design Study Methodology
40670935,An end-to-end interpretable machine-learning-based framework for early-stage diagnosis of gallbladder cancer using multi-modality medical data.,"<h4>Background</h4>The accurate early-stage diagnosis of gallbladder cancer (GBC) is regarded as one of the major challenges in the field of oncology. However, few studies have focused on the comprehensive classification of GBC based on multiple modalities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive diagnostic framework for GBC based on both imaging and non-imaging medical data.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study reviewed 298 clinical patients with gallbladder disease or volunteers from two devices. A novel end-to-end interpretable diagnostic framework for GBC is proposed to handle multiple medical modalities, including CT imaging, demographics, tumor markers, coagulation function tests, and routine blood tests. To achieve better feature extraction and fusion of the imaging modality, a novel global-hybrid-local network, namely GHL-Net, has also been developed. The ensemble learning strategy is employed to fuse multi-modality data and obtain the final classification result. In addition, two interpretable methods are applied to help clinicians understand the model-based decisions. Model performance was evaluated through accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, area under the curve (AUC), and matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).<h4>Results</h4>In both binary and multi-class classification scenarios, the proposed method showed better performance compared to other comparison methods in both datasets. Especially in the binary classification scenario, the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and MCC of 95.24%, 93.55%, 96.87%, 96.67%, 95.08%, 0.9591, 0.9636, and 0.9051, respectively. The visualization results obtained based on the interpretable methods also demonstrated a high clinical relevance of the intermediate decision-making processes. Ablation studies then provided an in-depth understanding of our methodology.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The machine learning-based framework can effectively improve the accuracy of GBC diagnosis and is expected to have a more significant impact in other cancer diagnosis scenarios.",Zhao H; Miao C; Zhu Y; Shu Y; Wu X; Yin Z; Deng X; Gong W; Yang Z; Zou W,"State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Intelligent Microwave Lightwave Integration Innovation Center (imLic), Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.",BMC cancer,2025-07-16,10.1186/s12885-025-14462-9,7.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(kw,abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Machine Learning; gallbladder cancer; Deep Learning; Interpretable; Multi-modality Medical Data
40654109,Development of a personalized visualization and analysis tool to improve clinical care in complex multisystem diseases with application to scleroderma.,"<h4>Background</h4>In complex diseases, it is challenging to assess a patient's disease state, trajectory, treatment exposures, and risk of multiple outcomes simultaneously, efficiently and at the point of care.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed an interactive patient-level data visualization and analysis tool (VAT) that automates illustration of a scleroderma patient's trajectory across multiple organs and illustrates this relative to a reference population, including patient subgroups who share risk factors with the index patient, to improve estimation of disease state. We conducted VAT usability testing with patients and clinicians. We then embedded results from internally cross-validated, Bayesian multivariate mixed models that calculate an individual's risk of critical events, utilizing baseline risk factors, patient-level information in past trajectories in multiple dimensions, and known outcomes from the entire population and relevant subgroups.<h4>Results</h4>The web-based application aggregates complex, longitudinal data to illustrate patient-, subgroup- and population-level health trajectories across multiple organ systems. Patients (N=7) exposed to the VAT reported increased knowledge about their disease and confidence in medical decision-making. Rheumatologists (N=4) were able to access 8.6-times more data in 81.5% of the time using 2/3 fewer clicks using the VAT compared to the EMR. Statistical modeling was successfully embedded in the VAT, enabling real-time estimation of a patient's risks of multiple complications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Systematic analysis and visualization of individual- and population-level data in a complex disease has potential to improve medical decision-making and warrants further study. Individualized risk estimation disseminated at the point of care may enable targeted screening and early intervention in high-risk patients.",Kim JS; Scott J; Fisher L; Smith LN; Stewart W; Woods A; Smithwright R; Koher D; Aslanbeik P; Shah AB; Tibbils B; Pitts SI; Gurses AP; Yang Y; Orbai AM; Rosen A; Hummers LK; Zeger SL; Shah AA,"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.",Arthritis care & research,2025-07-14,10.1002/acr.25613,7.0,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract)",
40663162,Advancements in non-invasive visualization of the immune checkpoint TIGIT: a systematic review.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT) is a novel immune checkpoint receptor implicated in tumor immune evasion. Non-invasive imaging of TIGIT expression holds potential for improving patient selection and monitoring in cancer immunotherapy. This systematic review aims to evaluate recent advancements in radiotracer development for non-invasive visualization of TIGIT.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to February 2025 using databases including PubMed and Web of Science. The search terms ""TIGIT imaging"", ""TIGIT PET"", ""TIGIT SPECT"", and ""TIGIT visualization"" were used, focusing on those reporting on the development, characterization, or application of immuno-PET tracers targeting TIGIT expression. Both preclinical and clinical studies were reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>Six studies met the inclusion criteria, exploring tracers targeting TIGIT expression on immune cells. These studies have focused on the development of TIGIT-targeted imaging agents, including radiolabeled antibodies, peptides, and nanobodies for positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging. These agents demonstrated high specificity and enabled visualization of TIGIT expression in preclinical models and one exploratory clinical study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Novel radiotracers for non-invasive imaging of TIGIT show potential for enhancing personalized cancer immunotherapy. TIGIT-targeted imaging agents allow for the visualization and quantification of TIGIT expression in tumors/tumor microenvironment, which in future might contribute to better patient selection and treatment monitoring.

40675422,Optimizing the visualization of the locus coeruleus using magnetization transfer contrast 3D imaging.,"<h4>Background</h4>The locus coeruleus (LC) is a key noradrenergic nucleus of the brain. Its dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, as well as psychiatric disorders. However, imaging the LC with sufficient contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) is challenging due to its small size and deep location in the brainstem. This study optimizes a 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequence with magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) to enable rapid, high-resolution LC imaging in under five minutes.<h4>Methods</h4>A high-resolution 3D-GRE-MTC sequence was optimized on a 3T scanner in 11 healthy volunteers (6 young and 5 older adults). Tissue properties were measured using in vivo MRI data, and simulations were performed to identify the optimal flip angle. LC visualization was evaluated by two independent raters using relative contrast ratio (rCR) and CNR. The diameter and the length of the LC were also evaluated. Each volunteer underwent MRI sessions over three days to assess test-retest reliability. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter-rater reliability and the mean ± standard deviation of LC rCR across sessions for test-retest reproducibility were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 98 scans were collected. The optimized protocol achieved 0.67 × 0.73 × 2 mm³ resolution with an 18° flip angle, 6.18 ms first echo, 52 ms repetition time, flow compensation, arterial suppression, and strict head immobilization. The LC exhibited a CNR of 8.27 ± 1.03, and rCR of 16.70% ± 1.77% (left) and 13.97% ± 2.19% (right), with good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 88.51%). Contrast stability between scans had a variability of 4%-11%. The bilateral LC was visible across 3-6 slices (6-12 mm). Using the full width quarter maximum measure, the diameter was 1.94 ± 0.40 mm for the left side and 1.67 ± 0.34 mm for the right side.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The optimized protocol enabled reliable, high-resolution LC imaging in under five minutes, providing a valuable tool for clinical and research applications.",Lyu H; He N; Wu B; Trujillo P; Yan F; Lu Y; Mark Haacke E,"Department of Radiology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.",NeuroImage,2025-07-15,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2025.121372,7.0,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(abstract)",Locus coeruleus; Neuromelanin-sensitive Mri; Magnetization Transfer Contrast; Reliability Of Lc Contrast
40658990,A Multimodal Analysis of Online Information Foraging in Health-Related Topics Based on Stimulus-Engagement Alignment: Observational Feasibility Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The recent increase in online health information-seeking has prompted extensive user appraisal of encountered content. Information consumption depends crucially on the quality of encountered information and the user's ability to evaluate it; yet, within the context of web-based, organic search behavior, few studies take into account both these aspects simultaneously.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to explore a method to bridge these two aspects and grant even consideration to both the stimulus (web page content) and the user (ability to appraise encountered content). We examined novices and experts in information retrieval and appraisal to demonstrate a novel approach to studying information foraging theory: stimulus-engagement alignment (SEA).<h4>Methods</h4>We sampled from experts and novices in information retrieval and assessment, asking participants to conduct a 10-minute search task with a specific information goal. We used an observational and a retrospective think-aloud protocol to collect data within the framework of an interview. Data from 3 streams (think-aloud, human-computer interaction, and screen content) were manually coded in the Reproducible Open Coding Kit standard and subsequently aligned and represented in a tabularized format with the R package {rock}. SEA scores were derived from designated code co-occurrences in specific segments of data within the stimulus data stream versus the think-aloud and human-computer interaction data streams.<h4>Results</h4>SEA scores represented a meaningful comparison of what participants encountered and what they engaged with. Operationalizing codes as either ""present"" or ""absent"" in a particular data stream allowed us to inspect not only which credibility cues participants engaged with with the most frequency, but also whether participants noticed the absence of cues. Code co-occurrence frequencies could thus indicate case-, time-, and context-sensitive information appraisal that also takes into account the quality of information encountered.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Using SEA allowed us to retain epistemic access to idiosyncratic manifestations of both stimuli and engagement. In addition, by using the same coding scheme and designated co-occurrences across participants, we were able to pinpoint trends within our sample and subsamples. We believe our approach offers a powerful analysis encompassing the breadth and depth of data, both on par with each other in the feat of understanding organic, web-based search behavior.",Zörgő S; Peters GJ; Jeney A; Kovács SD; Crutzen R,"Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht University, P.O.

40670764,Super-resolution deep learning in pediatric CTA for congenital heart disease: enhancing intracardiac visualization under free-breathing conditions.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study assesses the effectiveness of super-resolution deep learning reconstruction (SR-DLR), conventional deep learning reconstruction (C-DLR), and hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) in enhancing image quality and diagnostic performance for pediatric congenital heart disease (CHD) in CT angiography (CCTA).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A total of 91 pediatric patients aged 1-10 years, suspected of having CHD, were consecutively enrolled for CCTA under free-breathing conditions. Reconstructions were performed using SR-DLR, C-DLR, and HIR algorithms. Objective metrics-standard deviation (SD), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)-were quantified. Two radiologists provided blinded subjective image quality evaluations.<h4>Results</h4>The full width at half maximum of lesions was significantly larger on SR-DLR (9.50 ± 6.44 mm) than on C-DLR (9.08 ± 6.23 mm; p < 0.001) and HIR (8.98 ± 6.37 mm; p < 0.001). SR-DLR exhibited superior performance with significantly reduced SD and increased SNR and CNR, particularly in the left ventricle, left atrium, and right ventricle regions (p < 0.05). Subjective evaluations favored SR-DLR over C-DLR and HIR (p < 0.05). The accuracy (99.12%), sensitivity (99.07%), and negative predictive value (85.71%) of SR-DLR were the highest, significantly exceeding those of C-DLR (+7.01%, +7.40%, and +45.71%) and HIR (+20.17%, +21.29%, and +65.71%), with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001). In the detection of atrial septal defects (ASDs) and ventricular septal defects (VSDs), SR-DLR demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity compared to C-DLR (+8.96% and +9.09%) and HIR (+20.90% and +36.36%). For multi-perforated ASDs and VSDs, SR-DLR's sensitivity reached 85.71% and 100%, far surpassing C-DLR and HIR.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SR-DLR significantly reduces image noise and enhances resolution, improving the diagnostic visualization of CHD structures in pediatric patients. It outperforms existing algorithms in detecting small lesions, achieving diagnostic accuracy close to that of ultrasound.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Pediatric cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) often fails to adequately visualize intracardiac structures, creating diagnostic challenges for CHD, particularly complex multi-perforated atrioventricular defects. Findings SR-DLR markedly improves image quality and diagnostic accuracy, enabling detailed visualization and precise detection of small congenital lesions. Clinical relevance SR-DLR enhances the diagnostic confidence and accuracy of CCTA in pediatric CHD, reducing missed diagnoses and improving the characterization of complex intracardiac anomalies, thus supporting better clinical decision-making.",Zhou X; Xiong D; Liu F; Li J; Tan N; Duan X; Du X; Ouyang Z; Bao S; Ke T; Zhao Y; Tao J; Dong X; Wang Y; Liao C,"Department of Radiology, Kunming Yan'an Hospital (Yan'an Hospital Affiliated to Kunming Medical University), Kunming, China.",European radiology,2025-07-16,10.1007/s00330-025-11800-0,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Heart defects; image enhancement; Pediatrics; Computed Tomography Angiography; Deep Learning
40680384,Automated microvascular invasion prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma via deep relation reasoning from dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major global health concern, with microvascular invasion (MVI) being a critical prognostic factor linked to early recurrence and poor survival. Preoperative MVI prediction remains challenging, but recent advancements in dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging combined with artificial intelligence show promise in improving prediction accuracy. CEUS offers real-time visualization of tumor vascularity, providing unique insights into MVI characteristics. This study proposes a novel deep relation reasoning approach to address the challenges of modeling intricate temporal relationships and extracting complex spatial features from CEUS video frames. Our method integrates CEUS video sequences and introduces a visual graph reasoning framework that correlates intratumoral and peritumoral features across various imaging phases. The system employs dual-path feature extraction, MVI pattern topology construction, Graph Convolutional Network learning, and an MVI pattern discovery module to capture complex features while providing interpretable results. Experimental findings demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for MVI prediction. The system achieved superiors accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC. These advancements promise to enhance HCC diagnosis and management, potentially revolutionizing patient care.

40668815,Development of a risk prediction model for sepsis-related delirium based on multiple machine learning approaches and an online calculator.,"<h4>Background</h4>Sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) occurs due to disruptions in neurotransmission linked to inflammatory responses from infections. It poses significant challenges in clinical management and is associated with poor outcomes. Survivors often experience long-term cognitive and behavioral issues that impact their quality of life and place a burden on their families. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model for early prediction of SAD in critically ill patients. Additionally, we constructed an online risk calculator to facilitate real-time clinical assessment.<h4>Methods</h4>This study is a retrospective analysis utilizing data from 16,120 patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. To manage imbalanced data, we applied the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) method. Feature selection was conducted using Multivariate Logistic Regression, LASSO regression, and the Boruta algorithm. We developed predictive models using eight machine learning algorithms and selected the best one for validation. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used for visualization and interpretation, enhancing the clinical understanding of the model, alongside the creation of an online web calculator.<h4>Results</h4>We combined three feature selection methods to identify 17 key features for our machine learning prediction model. The Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model demonstrated excellent calibration and strong predictive accuracy in the validation cohort. The SHAP feature importance ranking revealed five critical risk factors for predicting outcomes: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), ICU stay duration, chloride, sodium, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). Based on this optimal model, we successfully developed an online web calculator.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed and validated a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting SAD with high clinical applicability.

40680255,"Future Me, a Prospection-Based Chatbot to Promote Mental Well-Being in Youth: Two Exploratory User Experience Studies.","<h4>Background</h4>Digital interventions have been proposed as a solution to meet the growing demand for mental health support. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising technology for creating more personalized and adaptive mental health chatbots. While LLMs generate responses based on statistical patterns in training data rather than through conscious reasoning, they can be designed to support important psychological processes. Prospection-the ability to envision and plan for future outcomes-represents a transdiagnostic process altered across various mental health conditions that could be effectively targeted through such interventions. We designed ""Future Me,"" an LLM-powered chatbot designed to facilitate future-oriented thinking and promote goal pursuit using evidence-based interventions including visualization, implementation intentions, and values clarification.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to understand how users engage with Future Me, evaluate its effectiveness in supporting future-oriented thinking, and assess its acceptability across different populations, with particular attention to postgraduate students' stress management needs. We also seek to identify design improvements that could enhance the chatbot's ability to support users' mental well-being.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 2 complementary studies were conducted. Study 1 (n=20) examined how postgraduate students used Future Me during a single guided session, followed by semistructured interviews. Study 2 (n=14) investigated how postgraduate students interacted with Future Me over a 1-week period, with interviews before and after usage. Both studies analyzed conversation transcripts and interview data using thematic analysis to understand usage patterns, perceived benefits, and limitations.<h4>Results</h4>Across both studies, participants primarily engaged with Future Me to discuss career or education goals, personal obstacles, and relationship concerns. Users valued Future Me's ability to provide clarity around goal-setting (85% of participants), its nonjudgmental nature, and its 24/7 accessibility (58%). Future Me effectively facilitated self-reflection (80%) and offered new perspectives (70%), particularly for broader future-oriented concerns. However, both studies revealed limitations in the chatbot's ability to provide personalized emotional support during high-stress situations, with participants noting that responses sometimes felt formulaic (50%) or lacked emotional depth. Postgraduate students specifically emphasized the need for greater context awareness during periods of academic stress (58%). Overall, 57% of requests occurred outside office hours, dropping from 40 on day 1 to 12 by day 7.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Future Me demonstrates promise as an accessible tool for promoting prospection skills and supporting mental well-being through future-oriented thinking. However, effectiveness appears context-dependent, with prospection techniques more suitable for broader life decisions than acute stress situations. Future development should focus on creating more adaptive systems that can adjust their approach based on the user's emotional state and immediate needs. Rather than attempting to replicate human therapy entirely, chatbots like Future Me may be most effective when designed as complementary tools within broader support ecosystems, offering immediate guidance while facilitating connections to human support when needed.",Dechant M; Lash E; Shokr S; O'Driscoll C,"University College London, 1-19 Torrington Place, London, WC1E 7HB, United Kingdom, +44 (0) 20 7679 1897.",JMIR formative research,2025-07-18,10.2196/74411,5.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw); data(abstract),Stress; Artificial intelligence; Anxiety; Mental health; Prospection; Student Well-being; Chatbot

40673030,"Pathophysiological mechanisms in severe preeclampsia: role of upregulated proteins in blood pressure, extracellular matrix and immunity.","<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to compare the plasma protein profiles between 7 preeclampsia patients with severe features (PE+) and 7 preeclampsia patients without severe features (PE-) and 10 healthy pregnancies (HP); identify differentially expressed proteins among these groups and explore the altered signaling pathways and their association with the severity of this cardiovascular condition.<h4>Methods</h4>Plasma proteins were quantified using mass spectrometry, followed by comprehensive bioinformatics and statistical analyses. Protein identification and annotation were performed using UniProt and PatternLab for Proteomics. Multivariate statistical analyses, including PLS-DA and sPLS-DA, as well as VIP score evaluation and Volcano plot visualization, were conducted with MetaboAnalyst to assess group separation and identify key discriminative features. Functional enrichment and pathway analyses were carried out using Metascape.<h4>Results</h4>Using a fold change and volcano plot validation of 1.2, comparisons between HP and PE+ revealed that proteins such as AMBP (inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor light chain), VTN (vitronectin), CLU (clusterin), F2 (prothrombin), and PZP (pregnancy zone protein) were upregulated in PE+. Conversely, ITIH4 (inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4), APOL1 (apolipoprotein 1) and SERPIND1 (heparin cofactor II) were downregulated in PE+ relative to HP. When comparing HP with PE-, SERPINA3 (alpha-1-antichymotrypsin) and HBB (hemoglobin subunit beta) were downregulated in PE-. Between PE- and PE+, APCS (serum amyloid P component) and HBB were upregulated in PE+; whereas SERPINC1 (antithrombin), PSG1 (pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein 1), ITIH4, and C5 (complement C5) were downregulated in PE+ compared to PE-.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings offer valuable insights into the different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the two subgroups of PE. The upregulated proteins in PE+ (AMBP, VTN, CLU, F2, PZP, APCS, and HBB) play key roles in regulating blood pressure, modulating the extracellular matrix and influencing immune responses.

40670558,Optimised RFO tuned RF-DETR model for precision urine microscopy for renal and systemic disease diagnosis.,"Accurate detection and classification of cellular and non-cellular components in urine microscopy images are essential for early diagnosis of renal and systemic health conditions. This study presents an optimized object detection framework based on the Red Fox Optimization (RFO)-enabled Roboflow-DEtection TRansformer (RF-DETR) model, designed to automate urine sediment analysis with high precision and low latency. The RF-DETR model leverages a transformer-based architecture with deformable attention and a DINOv2 (self-distillation with no labels) pre-trained visual backbone to capture multi-scale features effectively. RFO, a nature-inspired metaheuristic, is employed to fine-tune critical hyperparameters such as learning rate, decoder layers, and dropout, enhancing the model's convergence and generalization capabilities. Experiments were conducted on the RF100-VL urine microscopy dataset, where the proposed model achieved a precision of 0.78, recall of 0.66, mAP@0.5 of 0.737, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.44 after 100 training epochs. Compared to baseline models, the optimized RF-DETR demonstrated improved performance in detecting small and medium objects like leukocytes and erythrocytes-crucial components for urinary tract infection and kidney disease detection. The model's NMS-free design and multi-resolution training enable real-time inference on both GPU and edge devices. Additionally, visualization tools such as confusion matrices, F1-curves, and prediction overlays validate the robustness and interpretability of the system. The results confirm the suitability of the RFO-optimized RF-DETR framework for clinical deployment, offering a powerful tool for automated, scalable, and accurate urine analysis. Future work will focus on lightweight model variants, enhanced small-object detection, and domain adaptation using self-supervised and vision-language learning techniques.",Dahiya N; Prakash D; Kundu S; Kuttan SR; Suwalka I; Ayadi M; Dubale M; Hashmi A,"Department of Computer Science & Engineering, SRM University, Delhi-NCR, Sonipat, Haryana, India.",Scientific reports,2025-07-16,10.1038/s41598-025-11725-0,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Object Detection; Urine Microscopy; Automated Diagnosis; Hyperparameter Tuning; Rf-detr Model; Red Fox Optimization (Rfo)
40682883,Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy for imaging and distribution analysis of heavy metal elements in soil.,"The accumulation of heavy metals (HMs) in soil due to industrial activities and sewage irrigation poses serious environmental and health risks. In this study, soil samples contaminated with copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) were selected for investigation. An experimental system based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was developed to perform the elemental analysis and mapping of the contaminated soils. Based on the spectral line intensity, a 21 mm × 20.7 mm area was scanned via LIBS mapping with a resolution of 300 μm, enabling visualization of the spatial distribution of HM elements. The intensities of the selected emission lines were then converted into red, green, and blue (RGB) color channels to generate a composite image that visually highlights the HM-contaminated regions. To further classify contamination levels, the K-means clustering algorithm was applied to the spectral data, segmenting the soil surface into areas of severe, moderate, and slight contamination. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed for dimensionality reduction of the LIBS data, which facilitated the characterization of soil heterogeneity. Finally, the elemental mapping on the surface of the deep soil was carried out to investigate the distribution and migration characteristics of HM elements in three-dimensional space. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using LIBS technology for imaging and distribution analysis of HM elements in soils, offering valuable insights for environmental monitoring and soil remediation efforts.",Han B; Gao W; Feng J; Iroshan A; Yang J; Chen G; Zhang Y; Aizezi N; Liu Y,"State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base of Atmospheric Optoelectronic Detection and Information Fusion, Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China; Jiangsu International Joint Laboratory on Meteorological Photonics and Optoelectronic Detection, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology, Nanjing 210044, China.",Journal of hazardous materials,2025-07-16,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.139284,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Heavy metal; RGB; Libs; K-means; Elemental Mapping
40668514,Design and validation of a multi-angle planar surface electrode system for electrical impedance tomography.,"Electrical impedance-based imaging techniques offer a noninvasive and radiation-free alternative for assessing internal tissue structures. In this study, a novel bioimpedance measurement (BIM) system featuring a planar concentric ring electrode configuration was proposed to improve the spatial resolution and practicality of traditional electrical impedance tomography (EIT) approaches. Inspired by the 360° scanning principle of computed tomography (CT), the system enables multiangle current injection and voltage measurement through a structured stimulation protocol. A total of 32 electrodes, arranged in four concentric rings, were used to capture impedance variations across different angular perspectives, enhancing the detection of localized anomalies. The system was validated through both simulation and experimental studies. Simulations conducted using the EIDORS environment demonstrated successful localization of inhomogeneities within a modeled medium, whereas experimental tests using a saline-filled tank and embedded objects confirmed the system's practical effectiveness. Data acquired from the system were reconstructed into impedance images via the Gauss-Newton algorithm with total variation regularization, followed by image processing steps for improved visualization and boundary identification. The proposed system combines a cost-effective hardware design with a robust measurement and image reconstruction framework, offering a portable and accurate solution for biomedical diagnostics and laboratory research. The results highlight its potential for clinical and nonclinical applications requiring noninvasive monitoring.",Oguzhan B; Istanbullu M,"Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.",Physical and engineering sciences in medicine,2025-07-16,10.1007/s13246-025-01597-z,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Image reconstruction; Electrical impedance tomography; Planar Electrodes; Multiangle Measurement
40674935,Diffusion-based image translation from white light to narrow-band imaging in gastrointestinal endoscopy.,"Narrow-band imaging (NBI) enhances vascular and mucosal visualization, enabling early detection of gastrointestinal lesions. However, its adoption is limited by hardware constraints and costs, leaving white light endoscopy (WLE) as the widely used but diagnostically inferior modality. Translating WLE into realistic NBI-like images provides a scalable solution to improve diagnostic workflows, generate synthetic datasets, and facilitate multi-modality analysis. Translating WLE images into realistic NBI-like images is challenging due to the lack of paired WLE-NBI image datasets for training and the complex, varied nature of lesions in gastrointestinal endoscopy, which often involve rich details and subtle textures. In this study, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework tailored for WLE-to-NBI image translation. Leveraging stable diffusion with domain-specific enhancements, our method integrates LoRA fine-tuning to embed NBI-specific features and employs a self-attention injection mechanism to dynamically incorporate vascular and mucosal patterns while preserving the spatial structure and semantic integrity of the input WLE images. This approach ensures fine-grained feature translation and structural fidelity crucial for medical applications. Quantitative and qualitative experiments highlight the superiority of the proposed approach in generating high-fidelity NBI-like images. Furthermore, it demonstrates potential for data augmentation and robustness in long-range video frame registration, offering a reliable solution for enhancing clinical decision-making.",Wang B; Lei C; Hong K; Kan X; Ouyang Y; Li J; Guo Y; Li R,"Suzhou Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, 88 Keling Street, Suzhou, 215163, Jiangsu, China.

40658465,Single-port robotic-assisted approach in thoracic surgery: A prospective real-world study.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Robotic systems have enhanced thoracic surgery through three-dimensional visualization, maneuverability, and tremor filtration. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the da Vinci single-port surgical system for thoracic surgery in a Chinese population (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT06246617).<h4>Methods</h4>Patients with highly malignant pulmonary nodules suitable for minimally invasive lung resection underwent anatomical lung resection using a single-port robotic system between December 2023 and May 2024. Perioperative and short-term follow-up outcomes were also assessed. Clinical data from another clinical trial (RVlob Trial: NCT03134534) were also obtained for comparison.<h4>Results</h4>The procedure was successful in all 15 patients without intraoperative conversion, although three required an additional auxiliary port owing to a high body mass index and complex anatomy. Additionally, the median intraoperative blood loss and operative time were 15 (interquartile range [IQR], 10-37.5) mL and 100 (IQR, 86-119) min, respectively. The median length of hospital stay and duration of thoracic catheter retention were 8 (IQR, 7-9) and 2 (IQR, 2-2) days, respectively. No re-hospitalizations or re-admissions occurred. In comparison to the traditional robotic-assisted and video-assisted surgery groups, the single-port robotic surgery group showed a shorter operative time and less blood loss.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Single-port robotic thoracic surgery using the da Vinci single-port surgical system is safe and feasible for anatomical lung resection. Moreover, larger controlled studies are required to validate its effectiveness and compare its advantages with those of other surgical platforms.",Li C; Chen X; Wang X; Guo W; Zhang Y; Chen F; Li H,"Department of Thoracic Surgery and School of Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.",Interdisciplinary cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,2025-07-14,10.1093/icvts/ivaf161,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Lung cancer; Lobectomy; Segmentectomy; Single-port Robotic-assisted Thoracic Surgery; Da Vinci Single-port Surgical System
40675899,The Value of FAPI PET/CT in Cholangiocarcinoma and Pancreatic Cancer: An Update.,"To date, contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and, in selected cases, <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT) are the current standard imaging modalities for staging of pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) has gained interest as a promising molecular imaging target, particularly in tumors with a pronounced desmoplastic reaction such as pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. Radiolabeled FAP inhibitors (FAPIs) enable noninvasive visualization of cancer using PET/CT. Recent studies have demonstrated that FAPI PET/CT provides superior sensitivity compared to ceCT and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer for detecting primary tumors, lymph node involvement, and distant metastases, particularly in hepatic metastases due to low physiological background uptake. Furthermore, FAPI PET/CT has been shown to affect TNM staging and subsequently alter treatment-decision making. Beyond staging, early evidence suggests a prognostic potential of FAPI PET/CT in tumor grading, therapy response assessment, and survival outcomes, although data remain limited. On the other hand, FAPI PET/CT comes with limitations, particularly in the context of fibrotic and inflammatory processes such as liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, or primary sclerosing cholangitis, which may result in false-positive findings. This review summarizes the current clinical evidence for FAPI PET/CT in pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, with a focus on diagnostic performance, prognostic relevance, therapeutic implications, and potential pitfalls.",Pabst KM; Fendler WP; Jochheim LS; Herrmann K,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany; German Cancer Consortium, Partner Site Essen, A Partnership Between DKFZ and University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.

40683307,Evaluating the feasibility of platelet-derived gene expression profiling in dogs with sepsis.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To assess the feasibility of gene expression profiling of platelets in dogs with sepsis.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a prospective observational feasibility study conducted at a university veterinary teaching hospital. All study dogs had CBCs and serum biochemistry profiles, and blood samples were collected for platelet isolation. Gene expression profiling of isolated platelets was performed using a commercial multiplex assay based on direct hybridization and detection of single RNA molecules bar coded with fluorescent probes. Quality control, normalization, and data visualization were performed using standardized workflows. Raw counts were exported, and differential expression between groups was assessed.<h4>Results</h4>6 client-owned dogs with sepsis and 6 healthy dogs were enrolled from March through August 2023. Platelet isolation and transcript profiling were successful for all dogs. The septic dog group included 3 males and 3 females with peritonitis (n = 3), pyometra (n = 2), and pyothorax. Principal component analysis did not fully segregate septic from healthy dogs, but disease status accounted for 59% of the variance. Upregulated genes contributing substantially to principal component analysis variance included those for S100 calcium-binding proteins (S100s) and cytokines. Significantly upregulated genes based on log2 fold change included S100A8, S100A12, cathelicidin, lactoferrin, and innate immune response signaling proteins.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sample processing and data analysis workflows are scalable to larger, confirmatory studies to explore potential sepsis biomarkers.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Platelet gene expression profiles might offer insights into sepsis pathophysiology and potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

40681841,Disease clusters and their genetic determinants following a diagnosis of depression: analyses based on a novel three-dimensional disease network approach.,"Depression is strongly associated with a range of subsequent diseases. To elucidate key mechanistic pathways for targeted interventions, this study aimed to determine the main disease networks associated with depression as well as their underlying genetic determinants. We developed a novel three-dimensional network approach which refines disease association verification by incorporating regularized partial correlations, and facilitates robust identification and visualization of disease clusters (i.e., groups of depression-associated diseases with high within-group connectivity) through both non-temporal (illustrating by x-axis and y-axis) and temporal (by z-axis) dimensions. We applied this approach to a matched cohort of 54,284 middle aged patients diagnosed with depression and their 496,005 age- and sex-matched unexposed individuals from the Swedish national registers and validated our findings in a cohort from the UK Biobank. Additionally, we conducted genetic analyses, including polygenic risk score (PRS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), using genetic data from 10,754 depression patients in the UK Biobank. Our analysis of the Swedish cohort identified nine reliable disease clusters consisting of 85 component diseases associated with depression, of which six clusters with 30 diseases were successfully validated using the UK Biobank cohort. These were clusters characterized by central nervous system (CNS) diseases, respiratory system diseases, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and mental disorders. PRS analysis revealed a dose-response relationship between genetic liability to depression and the susceptibility for subsequent disease clusters, while GWAS identified eight genome-wide significant loci in four of the clusters. Overall, our novel three-dimensional disease network approach identified six robust disease clusters after depression across two large cohorts, each with shared and cluster-specific genetic underpinnings. These findings warrant further research on genetic-based risk prediction and the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at health improvement for patients with depression.",Hou C; Liu H; Zeng Y; Gong Y; Yang H; Ye W; Fang F; Valdimarsdóttir UA; Song H,"Mental Health Center and West China Biomedical Big Data Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.",Molecular psychiatry,2025-07-18,10.1038/s41380-025-03120-y,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40682676,Does PARP1 up-regulation correlate with PSMA expression in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer studied with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]PARPi and [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]PSMA PET/CT?,"<h4>Purpose</h4>[<sup>18</sup>F] Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), a novel radiotracer, enables visualization of PARP1 upregulation by PET imaging. Here, we aimed to quantify PARPi uptake in tumor lesions of metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) patients and perform a comparison with prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression using PET/CT scans.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from 22 male patients with mCRPC, who underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]PARPi and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans, were retrospectively quantified. Lesions with relevant PARPi uptake (higher than background) were delineated and correlated with their [<sup>68</sup>Ga]PSMA uptake using standardized uptake values (SUV). Additionally, a comparison was performed to investigate the effects of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) alterations on PARPi tumor uptake.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of metastatic PCa lesions that exhibited PARPi uptake were located in the bones (n = 57), with mean SUVmax values of 4.9 ± 1.5 for PARPi and 30.9 ± 28.3 for [<sup>68</sup>Ga]PSMA. Additionally, 3 local prostate lesions, 14 lymph nodes and 4 further metastatic lesions were detected. Significant correlations were identified between PARPi- and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]PSMA uptake, as measured by SUVmean (r = 0.48, p < 0.001), SUVpeak (r = 0.48, p < 0.001) and SUVmax (r = 0.43, p < 0.001) of the osseous metastatic lesions and SUVpeak (r = 0.49, p = 0.04) of extraosseous lesions. No significant differences were found between PARPi uptake of metastatic lesions in patients with or without HRD alterations (all p > 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Results showed a considerable uptake of [<sup>18</sup>F]PARPi in mCRPC patients and indicated a correlation between PARPi uptake and PSMA expression, suggesting the potential of using [<sup>18</sup>F]PARPi as a diagnostic imaging tool in mCRPC patients.

40666714,Utilization of Oxford Nanopore Technology for human infectious disease detection and surveillance in Africa: a scoping review.,"<b>Background.</b> Nanopore-based sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offers rapid, cost-effective and portable sequencing. As an emerging technology, ONT must be evaluated for efficacy and practical application in both high- and low-resource settings. This scoping review (SR) aimed to (1) describe how nanopore technology is used in Africa for surveillance and diagnosis of human infectious diseases, (2) describe how nanopore technology aids in the real-time detection of infectious pathogens in Africa and (3) identify challenges and opportunities for utilizing nanopore technology in Africa to study infectious diseases. <b>Methods.</b> This SR followed the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual framework for SRs. English language studies published from 1 January 2008 to 30 April 2024 that used ONT on human specimens collected in Africa and targeted ≥1 microbial agent were included. Searches were performed in Embase, Medline, PubMed, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library. The protocol was publicly available on the Open Science Framework Bastug <i>et al.</i> (Nanopore Sequencing for Infectious Diseases Surveillance and Diagnostics in Africa: a Scoping Review 2024) prior to data collection. Two independent reviewers screened studies using Covidence, and data was extracted using a custom REDCap instrument. Descriptive statistics and data visualization were performed in Microsoft Excel. <b>Results.</b> One thousand one hundred sixty-two studies were identified and 93 (8%) underwent full-text review. The portable MinION Mk1B was the most common ONT device (65% of studies). Eighty-eight studies analysed specimens from a single African country. Of these, 45% were sequenced in the same country, 7% in a different African country and 11% in a non-African country, while 32% did not specify the location. Specimen types included direct patient specimens (62%) and cultured isolates (35%), or a combination of both. Blood, serum or plasma was most common (35%), followed by naso- or oropharyngeal specimens (27%). Forty-four studies used ONT during an active infectious disease outbreak, 25 of which studied severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Seventy-two studies used ONT for genomic surveillance of infectious pathogens or antibiotic resistance genes, and one study used ONT for a direct clinical application. African-affiliated authors were included as first, middle and last authors in 46% of studies, and 15% were published by entirely African-affiliated teams. Ten studies published information on workflow timeline, and five studies published the per-specimen cost. <b>Conclusions.</b> ONT can enable timely and affordable sequencing in African countries as demonstrated through a small number of studies that accomplished these goals individually. Most studies used ONT for genomic surveillance of pathogens or antimicrobial resistance genes, while only one study used ONT directly for a real-time clinical application. A small number of studies described a short interval between specimen collection and sequence result, supporting that clinical applications are possible. There is a need for improved reporting of ONT methodology including pipeline timelines, cost, use of barcoding, flow cell models and the use of negative controls.

40678200,Extended Trochanteric Osteotomy Increases the Risk of Tapered Splined Stem Subsidence in Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>In the United States, tapered splined titanium stems (TSTSs) are the most frequently used femoral stem design in revision total hip arthroplasty. Despite encouraging and favorable results with TSTS, complications including femoral stem subsidence persist and subsidence >5 mm has been associated with implant failures and the need for aseptic rerevision surgery. We sought to investigate whether an extended trochanteric osteotomy (ETO) at the time of TSTS insertion increased mean subsidence and whether the amount of cortical contact was associated with subsidence, failure, and revision.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of a prospectively collected database including all patients who received a TSTS from 2016 to 2020. Data collected include surgery type, presence of an ETO, and stem specifications. Radiographs were reviewed to analyze cortical contact and postoperative subsidence. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine the association between contact length and subsidence.<h4>Results</h4>This cohort consisted of 299 hips, and 66 hips necessitated an ETO at the time of TSTS. Patients who required an ETO were more likely to subside (2.5 ± 0.2 mm vs 5.0 ± 0.7 mm, p < 0.001) and were more likely to subside >5 mm (32.3% vs 14.5%, p = 0.001). After controlling for other variables, an ETO was an independent risk factor for significant subsidence (adjusted OR: 3.4, p = 0.02). Contact length below the ETO was inversely related to stem subsidence (correlation coefficient of -0.26; p = 0.037), and multivariable logistic regression demonstrated bicortical contact > 30 mm to be a protective factor for significant subsidence (adjusted OR: 0.12, p < 0.001). Patients who received an ETO had a higher aseptic rerevision rate than patients who had a TSTS implanted without an ETO (16.1% vs 6.6%, p = 0.018).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients who receive an ETO during revision hip arthroplasty have a higher mean subsidence and 3-fold increase in odds for subsiding >5 mm. However, bicortical contact of 30 mm or greater below the ETO was protective against significant TSTS subsidence. Although not all patients with >5 mm of subsidence were revised, the aseptic rerevision rate was significantly higher in patients who received an ETO.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>An extended trochanteric osteotomy is an excellent technique to gain direct visualization of the femoral canal. However, it is not without its associated morbidity and postoperative complications, specifically stem subsidence. The results of this study suggest that when preparing for a TSTS after an ETO, careful consideration should be taken to confirm 3 cm of cortical engagement below the transverse limb of the ETO. The scaffolding technique, which prioritizes stem preparation followed by ETO closure, facilitates achieving sufficient cortical contact in the intact canal below the ETO segment. Consideration for intraoperative radiographs to confirm appropriate contact length and location may ensure sufficient fixation that will minimize the risk of postoperative stem subsidence.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Level III.

PLNTYs occur most commonly in children and young adults and are often associated with epilepsy and favorable clinical outcomes.<h4>Observations</h4>The authors present a case of PLNTY in the third ventricle, an unusual location for this tumor, with operative, histological, and molecular analysis. Notably, they identified a pathogenic TP53 mutation, which has been rarely reported in this tumor type. The operative video demonstrates anatomical and surgical considerations for this rare and newly recognized tumor type.<h4>Lessons</h4>The authors contribute a new case of PLNTY to the literature, highlighting the uncommon features of this case, including third ventricular localization and the presence of a TP53 mutation. They include a surgical case video for comprehensive visualization. These tumors typically exhibit indolent behavior and can be managed with resection alone. Comprehensive radiological, histological, and molecular evaluation is necessary to distinguish these tumors from other low-grade neoplasms. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE25346.",Ataoglu C; Uyaniker ZA; Erginoglu U; Ross M; Helgager J; Baskaya MK,"Departments of Neurological Surgery, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.",Journal of neurosurgery.

40678549,An Acoustofluidic Device for Sample Preparation and Detection of Small Extracellular Vesicles.,"Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have emerged as powerful vectors for liquid biopsy, offering a noninvasive window into the dynamic physiological and pathological states of the body. However, to fully leverage the clinical potential of sEV biomarkers, it is imperative to develop robust and efficient technologies for their isolation and analysis. In this study, we introduce a novel sharp-edge acoustofluidic platform designed for rapid and effective sample preparation, coupled with sensitive detection of specific sEV populations based on their surface markers. Our approach utilizes acoustically activated sharp-edge microstructures to concentrate bead-bound sEVs within the microfluidic device, facilitating immediate visualization by fluorescence microscopy. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of this portable acoustofluidic chip to selectively isolate and detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing vesicles, achieving nearly a 6-fold signal enhancement in EGFR-positive sEVs compared to EGFR-negative populations from sample volumes as small as 50 μl. This advancement not only underscores the potential of our platform for high-sensitivity biomarker detection but also paves the way for its application in isolating organ-specific sEVs. Such capability could be transformative for real-time monitoring of organ function and the simultaneous detection of multiple sEV markers, thereby broadening the scope of diagnostic precision and therapeutic decision-making in clinical practice.",Liu JF; Xia J; Rich J; Zhao S; Yang K; Lu B; Chen Y; Ye TW; Huang TJ,"Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC 27710, USA.","Cyborg and bionic systems (Washington, D.C.)",2025-07-17,10.34133/cbsystems.0319,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40661211,Molecular imaging using (nano)probes: cutting-edge developments and clinical challenges in diagnostics.,"Molecular imaging has emerged as a transformative approach in the field of medical diagnostics, enabling the visualization of biological processes at the molecular and cellular levels. Additionally, the integration of molecular imaging with other imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), and fluorescence imaging (FI) has further broadened the scope of diagnostics. Despite significant advances in probe design, including multifunctional and targeted nanomaterials, their clinical translation remains limited by critical challenges. Key obstacles include nanoprobe stability in physiological environments, nonspecific accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system, potential toxicity, and difficulties in achieving optimal biocompatibility and controlled biodistribution. Moreover, the complexity of nanoprobe synthesis and batch-to-batch variability hinder scalable manufacturing and regulatory approval. The primary goal of this review is to critically analyze the current challenges hindering the clinical translation of molecular imaging nanoprobes in biomedicine. While existing literature extensively covers imaging techniques, this review uniquely emphasizes the persistent obstacles-such as nanoprobe stability, biocompatibility, off-target effects, and limited sensitivity-that impede their effective application. Unlike previous reviews, which tend to focus broadly on advancements, we offer a nuanced perspective by identifying specific barriers and proposing promising strategies to overcome them. We explore how surface modification, novel targeting ligands, and smart responsive systems can enhance nanoprobe performance. Furthermore, the review discusses how addressing these challenges is crucial for accelerating the development of multifunctional nanoprobes capable of simultaneous diagnosis and therapy, ultimately advancing personalized medicine. By highlighting these hurdles and potential solutions, this review aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for researchers striving to optimize molecular imaging nanoprobes, thereby bridging the gap between laboratory innovation and clinical reality.",Samadzadeh M; Khosravi A; Zarepour A; Jamalipour Soufi G; Hekmatnia A; Zarrabi A; Iravani S,"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Istinye University Istanbul 34396 Türkiye.",RSC advances,2025-07-14,10.1039/d5ra03927d,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40680952,"A one-pot CRISPR-Cas12a-based assay for rapid, on-site detection of African swine fever virus.","African swine fever (ASF), caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), is a highly contagious and devastating disease threatening global swine production. The disease has caused substantial economic losses, driving the need for efficient diagnostic tools to enhance surveillance and control. Despite various available assays for ASF, field-deployable tools enabling rapid, accurate, and user-friendly detection remain urgently needed. Here, we developed and validated a novel one-pot recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-CRISPR-Cas12a assay for rapid and sensitive detection of ASFV by integrating all components into a single sealed tube, which requires only isothermal heating and ultraviolet visualization. The assay demonstrated a detection limit of 56 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL and could be completed within 35 min, and without cross-reactivity with non-ASFV porcine viruses. In comparative testing of 150 clinical samples, the one-pot RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a assay exhibited 100 % agreement with gold standard quantitative PCR (qPCR). Notably, the assay identified ASFV genomic DNA in whole blood as early as 3 days post-infection (dpi) with sensitivity comparable to the qPCR. This early detection capability, combined with a field-deployable format, provides a robust tool for implementing timely containment measures against ASF, especially in resource-limited setting.",Gao X; Dong X; Song H; Fu Y; Li J; Fan G; Wang T; Sun Y; Wang Y; Qiu HJ; Luo Y,"State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 678 Haping Road, Harbin 150069, China.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2025-07-16,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.146109,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),African swine fever virus; On-site Detection; Rpa-crispr-cas12a

40676196,Common bile duct dilatation on MRI in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Polycystic liver disease is the most prevalent extrarenal manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Non-obstructive asymptomatic common bile duct (CBD) dilatation has been observed anecdotally on CT scans, but CT is not optimal for biliary visualization. Here, we measured CBD diameter on T2-weighted MRI in ADPKD subjects to determine if CBD dilatation is associated with ADPKD.<h4>Methods</h4>CBD diameter was measured retrospectively on ADPKD subjects (n = 254) and on age- and sex-matched controls without ADPKD (n = 254) who underwent abdominal MRI. CBD diameter in these groups was compared and correlated with clinical, laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, including organ volumes and cyst burden.<h4>Results</h4>CBD median diameter [interquartile range, IQR, 25%, 75%] was 22% larger in ADPKD compared to controls (5.6 [4.7, 6.9] mm vs. 4.6 [3.9, 5.4] mm, p < 0.001). CBD diameter measurements had excellent inter-observer agreement (Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.92). Thirteen (5.1%) ADPKD subjects had a CBD diameter ≥ 10 mm compared to 1 (0.4%) control subject (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis found the presence of PKD1 or PKD2 mutation (beta = 1.5, P < 0.001) and age (beta = 0.04, p < 0.001) to be associated with increased CBD diameter and serum albumin associated with decreased CBD diameter (beta=-0.39, p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>ADPKD subjects had 22% larger CBD diameters than in non-ADPKD controls and were more likely to have CBD dilatation ≥ 10 mm without CBD obstruction.

40665893,Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging of Renal Microcirculation in a Murine Model of Renal Fibrosis.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Peripheral kidney microvascular damage and chronic perfusion dysfunction in kidney fibrosis are demonstrated in most chronic kidney diseases. There is an urgent clinical need to develop an in vivo, noninvasive, and quantitative diagnostic tool to monitor the renal microcirculation. The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of super-resolution ultrasound (SRU) imaging in the visualization and quantification of renal microvascular and microcirculation in mice of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).<h4>Methods</h4>The SRU for renal micro-vessels imaging in healthy mice was performed and compared with conventional power Doppler ultrasound (US) and micro-computed tomography (CT). Renal fibrosis was prepared in vivo using UUO. B-mode, conventional power Doppler US, and SRU imaging were performed on the sham kidneys and UUO models at 3, 7, and 14 days. Then these kidneys were followed by histopathologic analysis and comparisons with SRU quantification parameters.<h4>Results</h4>SRU helped to evaluate the function and structure of vessels in progressive renal disease via quantifying the renal microvascular. The quantitative parameters of SRU based on total blood flow of the kidney were calculated in the sham group, 3, 7, and 14 days after UUO. Renal cortical vessel density (r = 0.881), vessel curvature (r = -0.506), cortical perfusion index (PI) (r = 0.668) showed correlations with pathologically derived vessel density labeled with the expression of CD31. Vessel density (r = -0.615) and cortical curvature (r = -0.842), cortical PI (r = -0.508) also showed correlations with Masson's trichrome stain. Vessel curvature (r = -0.591) showed correlations with the expression of Col-1.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SRU imaging provides the noninvasive, dynamic, and longitudinal monitoring of vessel functionality and can provide quantification of renal microvascular changes in a murine model of renal fibrosis.",Xu Y; Luo Y; Chen M; Peng Q; Niu C,"Department of Ultrasonography, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,2025-07-16,10.1002/jum.70003,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Unilateral ureteral obstruction; ultrasound; Kidney Fibrosis; Super‐resolution Ultrasound; Contrast Enhanced Agent
40668464,Evolution of glioma exosome research: emerging trends and global collaborations (2005-2025).,"<h4>Background</h4>Glioma, a tumor derived from neuroglial cells of the central nervous system, is characterized by its high malignancy, frequent recurrence, and high mortality rate. Recent advances in exosome research related to gliomas have propelled this emerging field as a pivotal area of clinical neuroscience investigation. Despite extensive focus on glioma exosome research, a systematic visual analysis of this field remains lacking. Using bibliometric analysis, this study maps the scientific landscape of glioma exosome research to identify current hotspots and emerging trends in neuro-oncology.<h4>Methods</h4>This bibliometric analysis extracted glioma exosome publications from the Web of Science Core Collection(WoSCC) spanning 2005-2025.

40659860,Exoscopic-assisted head and neck surgery: a comparative evaluation optimizing ergonomics and workflow.,"Exoscopic surgery is an emerging visualization technique in head and neck surgery, offering a promising alternative to conventional surgical microscopes. AI-assisted functions and high-quality imaging support its integration into modern surgical workflows. Eleven head and neck procedures were evaluated, including otologic surgery, parotidectomy and microvascular anastomosis using exoscopic techniques. Subjective feedback was obtained from four primary surgeons and four surgical assistants (response rate 100%) via a custom, non-validated questionnaire comprising 18 items. Six questions compared exoscope versus standard magnification (microscope or surgical loupes) across domains including anatomical structure identification, depth perception, field illumination and magnification, preoperative setup handling, and overall preference. Twelve questions addressed ergonomic comfort, 3D glasses and head-mounted display (HMDmd) wearability, and intraoperative handling. Ergonomic strain was assessed using the validated Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). Exoscopic systems demonstrated advantages, such as superior 4K-3D imaging, enhanced depth perception, improved ergonomics and facilitated intraoperative collaboration and education. RULA scores indicated reduced musculoskeletal strain, especially during longer procedures. Mean setup time was 4:14 min (range: 4:05-4:45 min), including draping (mean 2:04 min; range: 1:50-2:30 min). Surgeons described a brief adaptation period, primarily related to foot pedal control and digital interface navigation. AI-assisted features, including Auto-Center and Voice Control, further optimized workflow. Exoscopic surgery offers benefits for head and neck procedures requiring sustained magnification and precision.

40665385,"Molecular characteristics of human adenovirus isolated from the 2024 influenza-like illness outbreaks in Suzhou City, China.","<h4>Background</h4>Human adenoviruses (HAdV) comprises a genetically diverse group of double-stranded DNA viruses strongly associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) outbreaks. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular characteristics of HAdV implicated during ILI outbreaks in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province in 2024.<h4>Methods</h4>Throat swab samples were gathered from settings with ILI outbreaks in Suzhou between March 2024 and January 2025. These samples were analyzed using rapid multi-pathogen detection and real-time PCR. HAdV-positive samples were inoculated into human epidermoid larynx carcinoma cell line (Hep2) for HAdV isolation, followed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using the MiSeq platform. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees for the whole genome, hexon, penton base and fiber genes were constructed using IQ-TREE v2.3.6 software. Amino acid variation analysis was performed with BioEdit 7.7.1 software, while recombination detection and visualization were conducted using Recombination Detection Program version 4.101 (RDP4) and SimPlot 3.5.1 software.<h4>Results</h4>Of 488 outbreak samples collected, 53 (10.86%) tested positive for HAdV, making it the second most prevalent respiratory pathogen. These HAdV-related respiratory outbreaks occurred during the spring-summer and autumn-winter transitions, showing no significant regional differences but a slightly higher positive rate in males than in females (13.83% vs. 7.66%, p = 0.028). Twenty-nine HAdV-positive samples were selected for viral isolation and genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most isolates clustered with recently circulating HAdVB3 strains, while several clustered with HAdVB7 or previously reported HAdVB3/7 recombinant genotypes. Compared with the HAdVB3 reference sequence (OQ518322.1), multiple nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions were identified in antigenic determinant domains (loop 1 and loop 2) of the hexon protein. Besides, four substitution sites were detected in each of the penton base and fiber proteins. Recombination analysis identified seven strains as HAdVB3/7 recombinants, displaying three distinct recombination patterns. Notably, the strain SZTC20241129 carried HAdVB7-derived insertional fragments spanning partial E2B gene region, 52/55 kDa protein, protein IIIa precursor (pIIIa), and the penton base. In contrast, the other recombinant strains (SZZJ20240513, SZTC20241133, SZZJ20240515, SZZJ20240516, SZCS20241240 and SZCS20241242) possessed an HAdVB7-derived genomic backbone along with multiple HAdVB3-derived insertional fragments, encompassing a range of structural and regulatory genes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>HAdV was one of the leading causative agents of ILI outbreaks in Suzhou in 2024, with HAdVB3 being the predominant genotype (22/29, 75.9%). Strikingly, HAdVB3/7 recombinant strains with P7H7F3 and P7H3F3 genetic constituents were also detected in a subset of cases (7/29, 24.1%). The genetic diversity of circulating HAdV continues to expand, driven by the emergence of novel amino acid substitutions and intertypic recombination events. These findings underscore the importance of sustained molecular surveillance to track viral evolution and inform effective public health strategies aimed at reducing the risk of severe clinical outcomes in vulnerable populations.",Zang J; Xing Y; Zhang H; Wu Y; Ya X; Shen Q; Dong Z,"Suzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suzhou, 215004, China.",Virology journal,2025-07-15,10.1186/s12985-025-02870-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Recombination; Variation; Phylogenetic analysis; Human adenovirus; Genome sequencing
40664864,Enhancing breast positioning quality through real-time AI feedback.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Enhance mammography quality to increase cancer detection by implementing continuous AI-driven feedback mechanisms, ensuring reliable, consistent, and high-quality screening by the 'Perfect', 'Good', 'Moderate', and 'Inadequate' (PGMI) criteria.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>To assess the impact of the AI software 'b-box<sup>TM</sup>' on mammography quality, we conducted a comparative analysis of PGMI scores. We evaluated scores 50 days before (A) and after the software's implementation in 2021 (B), along with assessments made in the first week of August 2022 (C1) and 2023 (C2), comparing them to evaluations conducted by two readers. Except for postsurgical patients, we included all diagnostic and screening mammograms from one tertiary hospital.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 4577 mammograms from 1220 women (mean age: 59, range: 21-94, standard deviation: 11.18) were included. 1728 images were obtained before (A) and 2330 images after the 2021 software implementation (B), along with 269 images in 2022 (C1) and 250 images in 2023 (C2). The results indicated a significant improvement in diagnostic image quality (p < 0.01). The percentage of 'Perfect' examinations rose from 22.34% to 32.27%, while 'Inadequate' images decreased from 13.31% to 5.41% in 2021, continuing the positive trend with 4.46% and 3.20% 'inadequate' images in 2022 and 2023, respectively (p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using a reliable software platform to perform AI-driven quality evaluation in real-time has the potential to make lasting improvements in image quality, support radiographers' professional growth, and elevate institutional quality standards and documentation simultaneously.<h4>Key points</h4>Question How can AI-powered quality assessment reduce inadequate mammographic quality, which is known to impact sensitivity and increase the risk of interval cancers? Findings AI implementation decreased 'inadequate' mammograms from 13.31% to 3.20% and substantially improved parenchyma visualization, with consistent subgroup trends.

40676187,Usefulness of electron density imaging from dual-energy CT for detecting pulmonary thromboembolism in unenhanced CT.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of electron density (ED) imaging in detecting pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) on unenhanced dual-energy CT (UCT) and to analyze stage-dependent changes in ED values.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In the in vitro study, venous blood samples were incubated to form thrombi and scanned to assess attenuation and ED changes across different thrombus stages. The in vivo study retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent UCT within 1 day of CT pulmonary angiography, measuring HU and ED values of PTE. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare these parameters and determine cut-off values for PTE detection.<h4>Results</h4>In vitro, HU and ED values significantly decreased over time across PTE stages (p < 0.001). The in vivo study included 384 PTEs from 118 patients (M:F = 63:55; mean age, 64.47 ± 13.68 years), comprising 220 acute (57.3%), 85 subacute (22.1%), and 79 chronic PTEs (20.6%). On ED images, 66.8% of acute PTEs were visible, compared to 36.4% on UCT. For subacute and chronic PTEs, ED images identified 10.6% and 8.9% of cases, respectively, while none were detected on UCT. The diagnostic cut-off values were 63.3 HU and 104.4% of the ED of water.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ED imaging enhanced PTE visualization on UCT. ED values progressively decreased with advancing PTE stage in both in vitro and in vivo analyses. A higher number of detectable PTEs were identified in the acute stage compared with subacute or chronic stages on ED images, and overall, more PTEs were detected with ED imaging than with conventional UCT.<h4>Key points</h4>Question The detectability of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) on electron density (ED) images from unenhanced dual-energy CT (UCT) and its variations across different PTE stages remain unexplored. Findings In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that ED values on UCT decreased as PTE progressed, with acute stages exhibiting statistically higher detection rates.

40678180,The Subscapularis-Sparing Windowed Anterior Technique (SWAT) for Anatomic Total Shoulder Arthroplasty.,"<h4>Background</h4>Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) has historically been performed via the standard deltopectoral approach, requiring violation of the subscapularis to access the glenohumeral joint. Subscapularis dysfunction has been documented in as many as 67% of cases and may lead to instability, weakness, and lower patient-satisfaction scores<sup>11-16</sup>. However, the rate of subscapularis failure is much lower, at 1.6% to 3.0%, with a reoperation rate for a failed subscapularis of 0.9% to 3.0%<sup>31,32</sup>. To preserve the subscapularis tendon, muscle-preserving techniques have been developed that allow for early postoperative motion and activity without prolonged immobilization. The subscapularis-sparing windowed anterior technique (SWAT) is a method for aTSA that preserves the integrity of the subscapularis as well as the deltoid. As a result of the complete preservation of the subscapularis, this technique offers the advantage of early postoperative motion with no restrictions. This technique also avoids the deltoid split that is required in some other subscapularis-preserving techniques.<h4>Description</h4>SWAT utilizes the standard deltopectoral incision. A window is created inferior to the subscapularis tendon and is utilized for the removal of inferior osteophytes, inferior translation of the humeral shaft, and capsular release. The rotator interval is also developed and is utilized to complete the humeral head cut, obtain glenoid exposure, and implant the components. Additionally, the use of preoperative planning allows accurate sizing of the humeral head component<sup>30</sup>. Prior studies have shown that this technique can be utilized to reliably attain acceptable radiographic and clinical outcomes<sup>30</sup>.<h4>Alternatives</h4>Alternatives include aTSA performed via the standard deltopectoral approach with a lesser tuberosity osteotomy, aTSA with a subscapularis peel or tenotomy, hemiarthroplasty, and other subscapularis-sparing aTSA techniques.<h4>Rationale</h4>The SWAT approach preserves the deltoid and the subscapularis by utilizing a deltopectoral approach and creating an inferior window to remove inferior osteophytes. This technique allows for adequate glenohumeral joint access, bone preparation, and implant selection and implantation. SWAT for aTSA is substantially different from other techniques described in the literature. Other subscapularis-sparing techniques require splitting of the deltoid<sup>16-19,22</sup> and substantial release of the inferior subscapularis<sup>20,21</sup> and have limitations related to difficult visualization of the humeral head for an accurate cut, difficult inferior osteophyte resection, and potential malalignment of the humeral components<sup>17</sup>. The SWAT has several benefits, including preservation of the deltoid, preservation of the subscapularis, the use of an inferior window to allow for complete removal of humeral osteophytes, adequate bone preparation, and accurate implant sizing and implantation.<h4>Expected outcomes</h4>Because of the complete preservation of the subscapularis, this technique offers the advantage of early postoperative motion with no restrictions. This technique also avoids the deltoid split that is required in some of the other subscapularis-sparing techniques. The SWAT aTSA is ideal for patients who would benefit from early mobilization and increased independence. The use of a sling can be discontinued early, and patients typically are satisfied with the level of function achieved in the first 2 weeks postoperatively. One prior study showed that this technique can be utilized to reliably attain acceptable radiographic and clinical outcomes<sup>30</sup>. No revisions or cases of mechanical failure were noted during the early postoperative period<sup>30</sup>. Therefore, the SWAT aTSA is a good option for patients without help at home and patients who will not tolerate, or whose quality of life will be substantially altered by, the use of a sling.<h4>Important tips</h4>Keep in mind that the SWAT can always be extended by takedown of the subscapularis at any point if there is concern regarding adequate access, especially if the surgeon is still learning the technique.The prevention of subscapularis rupture is based primarily on patient selection and intraoperative evaluation to confirm the integrity of the subscapularis. The subscapularis will not experience excessive stretching if the humerus is displaced inferiorly.Use of the inferior window to access and remove inferior osteophytes requires special care to protect the soft tissues by both directing the osteotome toward the glenoid during osteophyte removal as well as positioning the shoulder in adduction and external rotation. Place the elbow of the patient's arm toward their navel.Removal of osteophytes and release of the humeral attachments of the capsule through the inferior window are crucial, even in cases with a small osteophyte; the releases and osteophyte removal that occur with use of the osteotome act to release the inferior joint capsule, which is important for mobilizing the humerus inferiorly when accessing the glenoid.An intramedullary guide is utilized to assist in obtaining a reproducible 135° humeral head cut at the anatomic neck plane to match the neck-shaft angle of the humeral implant.It is also important to utilize a saw blade with a limited excursion width. When performing the head cut through the rotator interval, having a blade with a limited excursion and having the arm in adduction will protect the soft tissues (i.e., the axillary nerve and subscapularis tendon) and will be less likely to damage the glenoid.The trial broach positioning will allow a suboptimal head cut to be identified and corrected. If unsatisfied with the size of the head cut following removal of the guide, the surgeon can utilize a calcar planer as necessary to remove additional bone.Several techniques can be utilized to match the humeral components with the patient's premorbid anatomy and to avoid overstuffing. Preoperative templating with use of computed tomography scans and planning software helps to assess the appropriate head size. The use of a stemmed implant is preferred because it allows for the use of an intramedullary cutting guide, and having the stem helps to ensure appropriate implant positioning. Assessing the head cut and final stem position on fluoroscopy is also helpful.The final stem and head choices are impacted together on the back table and are implanted as an assembled humeral component. A tag suture is placed on the edge of the subscapularis and superior cuff in order to help facilitate implantation of the assembled humeral component.<h4>Acronyms and abbreviations</h4>SWAT = subscapularis-sparing windowed anterior techniqueaTSA = anatomic total shoulder arthroplastyLTO = lesser tuberosity osteotomyMRI = magnetic resonance imagingCT = computed tomography.",Smith AF; Sirignano MN; Schmidt CM 2nd; Mighell MA,"Florida Orthopaedic Institute, Tampa, Florida.",JBJS essential surgical techniques,2025-07-17,10.2106/jbjs.st.24.00007,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40679473,"Advancing knowledge, maps and tools to address obesity and related socio-economic disparities in Europe: the OBCT project.","The steady rise in overweight and obesity in Europe disproportionately affects people and communities with a lower socio-economic position (SEP). Many obesity prevention approaches exist, but these have had limited reach and unsatisfactory effects thus far, especially in low-SEP populations. In this context, there is a need for implementation of effective individual-level and population-based preventive strategies that also tackle health inequalities. Effective strategies require consideration of the complex and cross-domain obesity risk factors across the life course. Feasible and acceptable strategies require multisectoral collaborations and innovative approaches, including a whole-of community and systems perspective. With the Horizon Europe-funded OBCT project, we aim to quantify the relative contribution of biological, socio-cultural and built environment factors to obesity and the interactions of these risks within and across various life course stages; and translate the resulting knowledge into practical, equitable, and effective tools for action. These tools will include: a comprehensive obesity risk screener; a map of the obesogenicity of neighbourhood environments as well as trends in obesity prevalence of each European country; recommendations for lifestyle behaviours (diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviours) to prevent obesity during key life transition stages; a decision support dashboard for policy makers; and co-developed toolboxes to support implementation of policy recommendations in low-SEP communities. OBCT's outputs will highlight the areas and domains in which obesity should be targeted and will empower the research community, policymakers, health professionals and residents in Europe to adapt and implement strategies to effectively reduce obesity risk, particularly in low-SEP communities.",Lam TM; Aarestrup J; van den Akker ELT; Baker JL; Banik A; Berntzen BJ; Bertoni L; Beulens JWJ; Bjørnsbo K; Bryant S; Cereijo L; Choudhary P; Cuenca Cuenca VC; Diez J; Ekelund U; Ezzati M; O'Flynn M; Franco M; van de Geest J; Gullon P; Heggie L; Herstad SH; Holm S; Leach RJ; Lien N; Lobstein T; Luszczynska A; Mackenbach J; Meeusen R; Meijer P; Meshkovska B; Miettunen J; Nedelec R; Olney J; Paduszyńska N; Patel N; Powis J; Mohan Raju JS; Roseboom T; van Rossum EFC; Sanchez-Lastra MA; Sarker F; Sassi F; Sebert S; Siwa M; Stuber J; Tarp J; Toft U; Torp KAB; van Uhm J; Valiente Borox R; Wagtendonk A; Wetzel M; Woodward E; Zhu J; Lakerveld J; ,"Department of Epidemiology and Data Science, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",Global health action,2025-07-18,10.1080/16549716.2025.2517492,1.5,dashboard(abstract),Obesity; Policy; Implementation; Inequalities; Primary Prevention; Life-course; Socio-cultural Factors; Exposome; Co-creation; Lifestyle Behaviours; Maria Nilsson
