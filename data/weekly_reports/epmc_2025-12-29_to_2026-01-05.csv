41481954,Rapid identification of adulteration in American ginseng powder using near-infrared spectroscopy combined with machine learning.,"Rapid and reliable detection of adulteration in American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is essential for ensuring product integrity and safeguarding consumer health, as the powder is frequently adulterated with low-cost herbal substitutes. This study proposes a novel analytical framework integrating near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy with machine learning modeling to identify adulteration involving Panax quinquefolius L, Angelica dahurica, Astragalus membranaceus, Panax notoginseng, and wheat flour. A total of 1680 samples were prepared, including 6 types of adulterants and 4 adulteration levels (20 %, 40 %, 60 %, and 80 %, w/w). Spectral data were preprocessed using noise reduction, baseline drift correction, and scatter correction. Principal component analysis (PCA) provided preliminary visualization of clustering trends, whereas four supervised classifiers-k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM)-were comparatively assessed for classification performance. Among them, KELM achieved the best performance with an overall accuracy of 0.9560, precision/recall of 0.9629, and a Kappa coefficient of 0.9551 on the testing set. This study establishes an integrated NIR-chemometric framework using a hybrid-KELM for rapid, non-destructive, and interpretable authentication of American ginseng powder, where SHAP-based wavelength analysis highlights key spectral regions and provides practical guidance for developing simplified, application-specific NIR devices and broader detection of economically motivated adulteration in herbal products.",Zhai D; Zhou J; Ma J; Liu A; Liu J; Meng Z; Qiu C; Yang Y; Zhang N; Li P,"Henan Provincial Key Laboratory of Grain Resources Conservation and Utilization，School of Biological Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou 450001, China; Institute for Complexity Science, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou 450001, China.","Spectrochimica acta.

41469701,"Artificial intelligence in the workplace: a living systematic review protocol on worker safety, health, and well-being implications.","<h4>Background</h4>Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming employment and working conditions in ways that shape the safety, health, and well-being of workers. We describe a protocol for a living systematic review (LSR) that will examine the interrelationship between AI systems, employment and working conditions, and worker safety, health, and well-being. Research questions are: 1. What types of AI systems are being used within workplaces and how do their design and adoption impact worker safety, health, and well-being? 2. How do a worker's employment and working conditions affect the relationship between the adoption of AI systems and worker safety, health, and well-being? 3. How does a worker's social position (e.g., age, gender, race, disability) shape the interrelationship between AI systems at work, employment and working conditions, and their safety, health, and well-being?<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive search of primary qualitative and quantitative research will be conducted. MEDLINE, Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), and Web of Science will be searched every six to twelve months using database-specific terms and keywords. Title/abstract and full-text screening will be completed independently by two reviewers. Relevant articles will be quality appraised using a mixed method assessment tool adapted for studies of AI. Medium and high-quality studies will be synthesized using a best evidence synthesis approach. To ensure relevancy, applied workplace and AI stakeholders will provide feedback at all stages of the LSR process through dissemination excluding quality appraisal. Annually, we will evaluate the appropriateness of the review process (e.g., frequency of searches, requirement to refine research questions, utility of continuing LSR). Any amendments to protocols will be documented.<h4>Discussion</h4>This LSR will provide timely and evolving evidence on the implications of AI in the workplace that will be disseminated through a publicly available living review dashboard. We will capture the emerging impact AI has on workers. Findings can be used to develop strategies to minimize AI's potential workplace harms while amplifying its potential benefits, address emerging worker inequities, and inform ongoing discussions regarding responsible and safe AI adoption.<h4>Systematic review registration</h4>PROSPERO CRD42024625501.",Jetha A; Crouch M; Vold K; Peters SE; Vietas J; Sriharan A; Irvin E,"Institute for Work & Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.

41469404,GAITEX: Human motion dataset of impaired gait and rehabilitation exercises using inertial and optical sensors.,"Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide a cost-effective approach to assessing human movement in clinical and everyday environments. However, developing the associated classification models for robust assessment of physiotherapeutic exercise and gait analysis requires large, diverse datasets that are costly and time-consuming to collect. We present a multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic and gait-related exercises, including correct and clinically relevant variants, recorded from 19 healthy subjects using synchronized IMUs and optical marker-based motion capture (MoCap). It contains data from nine IMUs and 68 markers tracking full-body kinematics. Four markers per IMU allow direct comparison between IMU- and MoCap-derived orientations. We additionally provide processed IMU orientations aligned to common segment coordinate systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics outputs, and visualization tools for IMU-derived orientations. The dataset is fully annotated with movement quality ratings and timestamped segmentations. It supports various machine learning tasks such as exercise evaluation, gait classification, temporal segmentation, and biomechanical parameter estimation.

41460424,Single-cell and spatial transcriptome sequencing analysis reveals characteristics of a unique subpopulation in high-grade IDH-mutant astrocytoma.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>(Isocitrate dehydrogenase) IDH-mutant astrocytoma is classified as World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2-4 and is second only to IDH wild-type glioblastoma in the incidence of adult glioma. However, few studies use single-cell and spatial transcriptome sequencing to analyze its malignant progression.<h4>Methods</h4>Intraoperative navigation and yellow fluorescence visualization were utilized to accurately isolate high-grade (WHO grade 3-4) and low-grade (WHO grade 2) samples of IDH-mutant astrocytoma for single-cell and spatial transcriptome sequencing. By combining single-cell, spatial transcriptome, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) data, analyses of survival, enriched pathways, transcription factors, intercellular communication, differentiation trajectories, and immune response were performed to identify the characteristics of a unique subpopulation of high-grade IDH-mutant astrocytoma.<h4>Results</h4>Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified a distinct subpopulation (Cluster 7) present in high-grade IDH-mutant astrocytoma, which was localized to the terminus of the pseudotime trajectory. Importantly, this cluster not only exhibited an immunosuppressive phenotype correlated with poor clinical prognosis, but also demonstrated significant enrichment in Developmental Biology and Calcium Signaling pathways. Furthermore, this subpopulation engaged in prominent ligand-receptor interactions, particularly through PTN_PTPRZ1 and MIF_CD74 pairs. Notably, comparative analysis revealed that high-grade astrocytoma displayed both quantitatively and qualitatively enhanced communication networks when compared to their low-grade counterparts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identifies a distinct tumor cell subpopulation present in high-grade (WHO grade 3-4) adult IDH-mutant astrocytoma. This cluster, which likely arises from malignant progression in adult astrocytoma, may provide new insights for developing therapeutic strategies against this clinically challenging disease.",Chen W; Zheng M; An JY; Huang GH; Liu JP; Yang L; Ren P; Wang TT; Hugnot JP; Lv SQ,"Department of Neurosurgery, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.","Cellular oncology (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",2025-12-29,10.1007/s13402-025-01139-5,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Malignant Progression; Single-cell Sequencing; Idh-mutant Astrocytoma; Spatial Transcriptome Sequencing
41470026,An integrated platform for concurrent structural and single-nucleotide variants improves copy-number detection and reveals pathogenic alleles in undiagnosed Mendelian families.,"<h4>Background</h4>Copy number variation (CNV) is a class of genomic structural variation (SV) that contributes to genomic disorders and can significantly impact health. Short-read genome sequencing (sr-GS) enables genome-wide SV calling which has been shown to increase diagnosis in unsolved rare disease families. The growing number of large sequencing cohort projects with sr-GS data available requires open free analytical tools that provide visualization of CNV and SV integrated calls associated with gene annotation, proband-parent trio analysis to enable prioritization of de novo variants, B-allele frequency (BAF) plots to support CNV calls, parent of origin assessment and mosaicism detection.<h4>Methods</h4>To support those needs, we developed VizCNV, an open-source platform that incorporates read depth and BAF to enable haplotype-aware CNV analysis. The tool incorporates multiple interactive view modes for SV concurrent calls and annotation tracks for analyzing chromosomal abnormalities [e.g., aneuploidy, segmental aneusomy, and chromosome translocations], gene exonic rearrangements and non-coding gene regulatory regions. In addition, VizCNV includes a built-in filter schema for trio genomes, prioritizing the detection of de novo CNVs. We optimized VizCNV using 1000 Genomes Project data and benchmarked its performance against a cohort containing CNVs validated by multiple technologies. Finally, we applied VizCNV to a molecularly unsolved primary immunodeficiency disease cohort (PIDD, n = 39) previously analyzed by exome sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>Upon computational optimization, VizCNV achieved approximately 82.3% recall and 76.3% precision for deletions > 10 kb. VizCNV accurately detected all 71 validated copy number gains and correctly indicated potential underlying genomic complexities. Haplotype-aware CNV analysis identified a meiosis I non-disjunction event (trisomy 21), three de novo CNVs at two unique loci and 48 inherited candidate CNVs in the PIDD cohort of which 42% (20/48) were validated by integrated CNV/BAF analysis. Moreover, genotype-phenotype analyses revealed that a compound heterozygous combination of a paternal 12.8 kb deletion of exon 5 and a maternal missense variant allele of DOCK8 are the molecular cause of one proband diagnosed with Hyper-IgE syndrome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>VizCNV provides a robust and flexible platform for identification of aneuploidies, CNV, SV discovery and visualization of CNV and BAF data. It is also a useful tool to investigate features of genomic rearrangements such as parental origin which has implications for genetic counseling and mechanistic studies.

41476218,Prevalence and associated risk factors of asymptomatic malaria in Nigeria: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Asymptomatic malaria presents a significant barrier to malaria elimination efforts, particularly in endemic countries like Nigeria. Despite its public health relevance, no national-level pooled estimate of its prevalence and associated risk factors currently exists for Nigeria. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize existing data to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria and identify affected populations and risk factors across Nigeria.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus was conducted to identify observational studies reporting the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in Nigeria. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024591788). Eligible studies were screened using Rayyan software, and relevant data were extracted into Microsoft Excel. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata version 15.0. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the pooled prevalence. Heterogeneity was assessed using meta-regression and subgroup analyses, while publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot visualization.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 25 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in Nigeria was estimated at 33% (95% CI 26-41). Prevalence varied by population subgroup, ranging from 25% in the general population to 52% in children. Risk factor analysis revealed an overall prevalence of 19% related to education level, 36% based on sex, and 39% associated with insecticide-treated net (ITN) usage.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This review highlights a high prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in Nigeria, particularly among children. While asymptomatic infections sustain transmission, current evidence underscores the need to prioritize proven transmission-reduction tools. With reduced transmission, the asymptomatic reservoir can then be more effectively addressed through complementary strategies.",Mukhtar A; Ismail M; Usman A; Odetokun IA; Ibrahim MA; Salman AA; Bawa-Sani HG; Nass SS; Goni BW; Shehu MN; Nuhu A; Zhang X; Isah MB,"Joint Laboratory for Antibody Research and Application, Shaanxi International Cooperation Demonstration Base, Shaanxi University of Technology, Hanzhong, 723000, Shaanxi, China.",Malaria journal,2025-12-31,10.1186/s12936-025-05671-5,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Children; Prevalence; Pregnant women; risk factors; Nigeria; Malaria Control; Asymptomatic Malaria
41478542,Clinical evaluation of a low-cost and high-fidelity animal model for palpable and nonpalpable implant removal.,"<h4>Objective(s)</h4>Deeper contraceptive implant removal remains a difficult skill. Clinicians involved in the care of women need trainings and expertise in advanced techniques to localize and remove contraceptive implants. We developed a low-cost high-fidelity animal model as a new model training for deep contraceptive implant removal. We aimed to evaluate the chicken leg model by experts from French centers of experience and non-experts interested in deep implant removal.<h4>Study design</h4>In this training study, 34 gynecologists were invited to participate in the training program for both superficial and deep implant localization and removal in chicken leg model using ultrasonography (US). Each part of the training program was timed from the moment when the probe was placed on the model to the location of the implant and self-evaluated using a five-point Likert scale.<h4>Results</h4>The participants were able to locate superficial or deep implants in all cases. US detection for superficial and deep implants in the transverse view was easier than US visualization in the longitudinal axis although it took more time for participants to find the deep implant in transverse view. Surgical removal was always possible. There was no statistically significant difference between experts and non-experts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our chicken leg model could be relevant, effective and useful as a training program for healthcare professionals involved in deep implant removal.<h4>Implication(s) statement</h4>Our results seem to confirm that our chicken leg model may be an easy-to-use, useful and reproducible training program for healthcare professionals involved in deep implant removal.",Chene G; Atallah A; Ohannessian A; Moret S; Cerruto E; Agostini A; Nohuz E,"Department of Gynecology, Hôpital Femme Mère Enfant, HFME, 59 boulevard Pinel, University hospital of Lyon, 69500 Bron, France; EMR 3738 CICLY, University Claude Bernard of Lyon 1, 69000 Lyon, France.

41483265,High-Photostability Perylene-Derived Probe Enables Accurate Dual-Modality Imaging of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential.,"Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) is a key indicator of mitochondrial function and cellular health. Fluorescence intensity-based methods are widely used for MMP monitoring, where probe photostability is critical for accurate quantification. To improve imaging reliability, we developed a photostable mitochondrial-targeted probe, PDI-TPP, by linking perylene diimide (PDI) with triphenylphosphonium (TPP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PDI being rationally designed and synthesized as a FRET donor for MMP sensing. Acting as a FRET donor, PDI-TPP pairs with SiR-BA, which is synthesized by conjugating silicon-rhodamine with butyric acid, to achieve dual-modality imaging through both fluorescence intensity ratio and lifetime. Compared to our previous donor OR-C8, PDI-TPP shows significantly enhanced photostability, reducing photobleaching artifacts and enabling dynamic visualization of MMP changes.

41475030,Rapid one-tube sputum processing for tuberculosis diagnosis via azide-functionalized magnetic nanoplatforms with selective bacterial capture.,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health challenge requiring rapid and reliable diagnostic tools. Here, azide-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs-N₃) were synthesized, characterized, and applied for one-tube detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in sputum. Structural analyses including Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) confirmed successful functionalization, uniform morphology, and preserved superparamagnetism. MNPs-N₃ were integrated into modified Ehrlich-Ziehl-Neelsen (MNPs-N₃-assisted EZN staining) and auramine-rhodamine (MNPs-N₃-assisted AR staining) staining protocols to enhance bacterial capture and visualization without decontamination or centrifugation. Control experiments using non-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles showed no bacterial co-localization, supporting the specificity of the azide-mediated interaction. The entire process was completed within one hour, offering a rapid alternative to conventional culture requiring ≥ 41 days. Using Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) culture as the reference, MNPs-N₃-assisted AR staining achieved 99 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity, outperforming MNPs-N₃-assisted EZN staining (95 % and 96 %, respectively). Diagnostic indices, including Youden index (0.96) and F1-score (0.98), demonstrated excellent agreement with culture results. These findings establish MNPs-N₃ as a fast, efficient, and cost-effective tool for Mtb diagnosis. The single-tube workflow minimizes contamination risk and simplifies laboratory handling, supporting potential application in resource-limited settings. Further optimization and large-scale clinical validation are still warranted.",Tural B; Bilden A; Ertaş E; Tural E; Temiz H; Özbek E; Tural S,"Department of Nanotechnology, Institute of Science, Dicle University, Diyarbakir 21280, Turkey; Department of Chemistry, Institute of Science, Dicle University, Diyarbakir 21280, Turkey.

41472605,Micro-Computed Tomography Based Whole Block Imaging of Asthma-Associated Airway Remodeling With Mycobacterium avium-Induced Cavity Formation: 3-Dimensional Nondestructive Analysis.,"Asthma is a recognized risk factor for nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary infections, yet the precise routes of infection and dissemination remain visually unclear. We analyzed a rare surgical case of asthma complicated by Mycobacterium avium-associated lung cavity formation in a young adult. Following antibiotic treatment, the patient underwent left upper segmentectomy, with successful subsequent treatment of residual lesions using amikacin liposome inhalation suspension. To precisely visualize the infection route, we utilized a three-dimensional merged whole block imaging (WBI) technique. Fifteen formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from the resected lung were individually scanned using a custom-built micro-computed tomography system, reconstructed, and combined to generate merged-WBI. Three core merged-WBIs revealed that the remodeled asthma-associated airway ascended from the proximal hilar region, intertwined with surrounding epithelioid granulomatous tissue, and then descended into a subpleural cavity composed of epithelioid granulomas with central caseous necrosis containing acid-fast bacilli. Besides the distinct airway path, the WBI delineated the distribution of minor epithelioid granulomas and calcifications. This report provides the first three-dimensional visualization of a continuous airway route extending from the hilum to a subpleural cavity using merged-WBI, suggesting bronchial spread as a probable mechanism of NTM dissemination in the setting of chronic airway disease.

41474223,"Advanced Endoscopic Approaches for Skull Base Surgery: A Contemporary Imaging-Focused Review, From the &lt;i&gt;AJR&lt;/i&gt; Special Series on Critical Anatomy.","Endoscopic skull base surgery has become widely accepted due to the advantages of the minimally invasive approach and achievement of outcomes that are comparable to those from open approaches. Given limited visualization of this region on clinical examination, preoperative planning relies heavily on diagnostic imaging to determine the optical surgical approach and the intended extent of resection. Within this context, high-resolution CT and MRI provide valuable information regarding the pathology, its relationship to critical structures, and other pertinent anatomic considerations. This Special Series Review describes the role of imaging in advanced endoscopic endonasal skull base surgeries, addressing clinically relevant normal and variant anatomy, key surgical landmarks, and pertinent red flags that serve as cautionary imaging findings. We discuss common pathologies occurring along these anatomic corridors and outline the core steps for specific surgical approaches. It is essential for interpreting radiologists to have a thorough understanding of the key anatomic structures and their relationships to pathology, to help surgeons select the appropriate EEA corridor, optimize the extent of resection, minimize surgical risk, and determine reconstruction options.",Khanpara S; Calle S; Jo M; Su SY; Hanna EY; Raza SM; Wintermark M; Learned KO,The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.,AJR.

41482716,The Application Value of Transvaginal Three-Dimensional Ultrasonography in the Diagnosis of Adenomyosis of the Uterus.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to investigate the variations in junctional zone (JZ) ultrasonographic parameters using three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (3D-TVS) across different age groups and evaluate their diagnostic potential for adenomyosis.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 patients who underwent 3D-TVS examinations. Participants were categorized into adenomyosis and healthy control groups, with the control group further stratified into three age-based subgroups (20+, 30+, and 40+ years). Quantitative JZ parameters were meticulously measured, including maximum thickness (JZmax), minimum thickness (JZmin), thickness difference (JZdif, calculated as JZmax - JZmin), myometrial thickness adjacent to JZmax, and the ratio of JZmax to adjacent myometrial thickness. Statistical comparisons were performed among groups, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the area under the curve (AUC) müllerian values for adenomyosis diagnosis.<h4>Results</h4>Age-stratified analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in JZ parameters among control subgroups (p > 0.05), indicating minimal age-related variations in JZ characteristics. Compared to healthy controls, adenomyosis patients demonstrated significantly elevated values in JZmax, JZmin, JZdif, and the myometrial thickness adjacent to JZmax (p < 0.05). ROC analysis yielded AUC values of 0.85 for JZmax, 0.84 for myometrial thickness adjacent to JZmax, 0.79 for JZdif, and 0.76 for JZmin. Optimal diagnostic performance was achieved at JZmax ≥ 0.45 cm, demonstrating 77% sensitivity and 89% specificity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>3D-TVS with 3D reconstruction technology enables clear visualization of uterine coronal section and accurate quantification of JZ parameters.

41483205,Digital variance angiography enables up to 80% reduction in stationary acquisition radiation dose during prostatic artery embolization: a prospective randomized trial.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Digital variance angiography (DVA) has demonstrated superior image quality compared to digital subtraction angiography (DSA), but its potential remains underexplored for complex procedures.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled 70 patients (mean ± SD age: 69.23 ± 8.7, range 53-96) undergoing PAE between January and October 2023. Patients were randomized to normal dose (ND) DSA (n = 35) or ultra-low dose (ULD) DSA (n = 35), with the latter reducing target detector dose by 72% for stationary acquisitions only. Radiation dose analysis was limited to stationary acquisitions, as only these series were acquired using the modified low-dose protocol. Dose-area product (DAP), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR), and visual image quality of DSA and DVA images were compared. Three experienced interventional radiologists conducted a randomized, blinded 5-point Likert evaluation of large and small vessels, tissue blush, and background noise. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney tests, Spearman correlation, Kendall Tau B, and Bangdiwala's B for interrater agreement.<h4>Results</h4>The ULD protocol reduced stationary acquisition-related DAP by up to 80% compared to controls (580 ± 66 vs 2872 ± 396 µGym²/patient, p < 0.001). DVA showed significantly higher CNR in both groups, with median CNR<sub>DVA</sub>/CNR<sub>DSA</sub> ratios of 3.85 in ND and 4.60 in ULD. DVA images achieved significantly higher scores for small vessels and tissue blush visualization (p < 0.001; CNR: 4.10 vs 2.88; Likert rating: 2.79 vs 1.58).<h4>Conclusion</h4>DVA enables substantial radiation dose reduction in PAE while maintaining superior image quality versus DSA, potentially improving angiographic safety and efficacy.<h4>Key points</h4>Question DVA is useful in reducing dose and enhancing image quality, yet it was not validated for complex angiographic procedures. Findings DVA provides better qualitative and quantitative image quality than DSA with reduced dose for prostatic artery embolizations. Clinical relevance DVA significantly improves image quality in Prostatic Artery Embolization compared to DSA, which allows up to 80% reduction in radiation burden to patients and interventionalists alike, while it also maintains diagnostic image quality.",Alizadeh LS; Vogl TJ; Rafi W; Caruso M; Elek R; Osvath S; Nica A; Gruenewald LD; Yel I; Goekduman A; Koch V; Dimitrova M; D'Angelo T; Booz C,"Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.
