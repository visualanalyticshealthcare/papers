40957997,Mapping and managing geographic variation in elective surgeries through user-friendly data presentation: insights from Tuscany region.,"Geographic variation in elective surgical procedures poses challenges to healthcare equity, efficiency, and resource allocation. This study investigates variation in 14 elective surgical procedures performed in Tuscany, Italy, in 2022, focusing on both regional and Local Health Authority levels. Using hospital discharge data, we calculated treatment rates and the Systematic Component of Variation (SCV) to quantify unwarranted variation, applying McPherson et al. (1996)'s thresholds for interpretation. Results revealed substantial differences across procedures, with low SCVs for hip replacement and inguinal hernia repair, and very high SCVs for vein stripping and coronary artery bypass grafting. To support interpretation and governance, we developed a graphical tool that visually represents SCV levels using an intuitive, color-coded format. The tool was designed to reduce the uncertainty healthcare professionals often face when interpreting variation without clear clinical benchmarks, helping them distinguish between acceptable and potentially unwarranted differences. It was presented during the 2023 Tuscan Performance Evaluation System event and pilot-tested in 2025 with 23 healthcare professionals. The tool improved participants' ability to identify the most appropriate level of governance for action and increased confidence in understanding variation patterns. This study offers a replicable model for analyzing variation and demonstrates the value of user-friendly data visualizations in supporting informed, equity-oriented healthcare decisions. Further validation is recommended to assess long-term impact.",Caputo A; Vainieri M; Nuti S,"Management and Healthcare Laboratory, Institute of Management, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy. alessia.caputo@santannapisa.it.",Research in health services & regions,2025-09-17,10.1007/s43999-025-00074-0,9.8,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",Data Visualization; Elective Surgery; Performance Evaluation System; Healthcare Decision-making; Unwarranted Variation; Systematic Component Of Variation

40970995,A novel robotic system based on heterogeneous master-slave control algorithm: design and its clinical application in endoscopic submucosal dissection.,"Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is the gold standard for early gastrointestinal tumor resection but remains technically demanding due to limitations in visualization, traction, and instrument control. A flexible auxiliary single-arm transluminal endoscopic robot (FASTER, EndoFaster) was therefore developed to provide real-time traction assistance. The EndoFaster system underwent a two-stage validation. Technical assessment confirmed real-time control performance, including motion latency, trajectory fidelity, and positional accuracy. Subsequently, a prospective, randomized multicenter trial across six hospitals enrolled 192 ESD patients, randomized 1:1 to robotic-assisted ESD or conventional ESD. Primary endpoint was en bloc (R0) resection rate; secondary endpoints included dissection time, submucosal visualization, intraprocedural complications, and operator workload. EndoFaster achieved stable, accurate motion performance, systems validation confirmed precise real-time motion mapping between master-slave controllers within clinically acceptable thresholds. In multicenter clinical trials, en bloc resection rates were comparable between the EndoFaster (98.84%) and control groups (98.13%), confirming non-inferiority. The system significantly reduced dissection time (P = 0.00435), improved submucosal visualization, and decreased muscular injury incidence and operator workload. The EndoFaster robotic assistance system serves as a dynamic ""third hand,"" effectively enhancing submucosal visualization and traction control. This improves the safety and efficiency of ESD while preserving standard clinical workflows.",Fan K; Lv ML; Tian H; Shen L; Ke A; Chen L; Zhang H; Jing Y; Yang J,"Robo Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Shenzhen, China.",Journal of robotic surgery,2025-09-19,10.1007/s11701-025-02686-7,7.5,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract)",Endofaster; Real-time Traction; Robotic-assisted Esd; Submucosal Visualization

40967756,Fully Automated Image-Based Multiplexing of Serial PET/CT Imaging for Facilitating Comprehensive Disease Phenotyping.,"Combined PET/CT imaging provides critical insights into both anatomic and molecular processes, yet traditional single-tracer approaches limit multidimensional disease phenotyping; to address this, we developed the PET Unified Multitracer Alignment (PUMA) framework-an open-source, postprocessing tool that multiplexes serial PET/CT scans for comprehensive voxelwise tissue characterization. <b>Methods:</b> PUMA utilizes artificial intelligence-based CT segmentation from multiorgan objective segmentation to generate multilabel maps of 24 body regions, guiding a 2-step registration: affine alignment followed by symmetric diffeomorphic registration. Tracer images are then normalized and assigned to red-green-blue channels for simultaneous visualization of up to 3 tracers. The framework was evaluated on longitudinal PET/CT scans from 114 subjects across multiple centers and vendors. Rigid, affine, and deformable registration methods were compared for optimal coregistration. Performance was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient for organ alignment and absolute percentage differences in organ intensity and tumor SUV<sub>mean</sub> <b>Results:</b> Deformable registration consistently achieved superior alignment, with Dice similarity coefficient values exceeding 0.90 in 60% of organs while maintaining organ intensity differences below 3%; similarly, SUV<sub>mean</sub> differences for tumors were minimal at 1.6% ± 0.9%, confirming that PUMA preserves quantitative PET data while enabling robust spatial multiplexing. <b>Conclusion:</b> PUMA provides a vendor-independent solution for postacquisition multiplexing of serial PET/CT images, integrating complementary tracer data voxelwise into a composite image without modifying clinical protocols.

40961110,Democratizing social media for health research: LLM-powered data analytics platform for NCDs.,"Despite over 41 million annual deaths from Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) globally, predominantly in low and middle-income countries, public access to relevant information from social media is hindered by restrictive licensing of existing social listening tools. This study introduces NCDs Listener, an open-source tool designed to simplify the extraction, summarization, and visualization of NCD-related knowledge from social media comments (Facebook and Reddit posts) in both English and Thai. The tool utilizes keyword matching and the BERT model for knowledge extraction, followed by descriptive statistical analysis. A generative AI model, specifically Google Gemini 2.0 Flash as per the saved information, summarizes this extracted knowledge into human-readable sentences, focusing on medical and healthcare insights. Preliminary results indicate that NCDs Listener improves dashboard comprehension for both general users and data scientists, with the general users showing higher comprehension. Furthermore, both user groups preferred medically focused generative AI summaries over general summaries (p-value <0.001). These findings suggest that NCDs Listener not only provides immediate insights but also establishes a foundation for advanced data analysis, fostering new opportunities for understanding complex social phenomena and predicting emerging trends.

40954476,Three-layered semantic framework for public health intelligence.,"<h4>Background</h4>Disease surveillance systems play a crucial role in monitoring and preventing infectious diseases. However, the current landscape, primarily focused on fragmented health data, poses challenges to contextual understanding and decision-making. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a semantic framework using ontologies to provide a unified data representation for seamless integration. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach using a case study of a COVID-19 incident at a football game in Italy.<h4>Method</h4>In this study, we undertook a comprehensive approach to gather and analyze data for the development of ontologies within the realm of pandemic intelligence. Multiple ontologies were meticulously crafted to cater to different domains related to pandemic intelligence, such as healthcare systems, mass gatherings, travel, and diseases. The ontologies were classified into top-level, domain, and application layers. This classification facilitated the development of a three-layered architecture, promoting reusability, and consistency in knowledge representation, and serving as the backbone of our semantic framework.<h4>Result</h4>Through the utilization of our semantic framework, we accomplished semantic enrichment of both structured and unstructured data. The integration of data from diverse sources involved mapping to ontology concepts, leading to the creation and storage of RDF triples in the triple store. This process resulted in the construction of linked data, ultimately enhancing the discoverability and accessibility of valuable insights. Furthermore, our anomaly detection algorithm effectively leveraged knowledge graphs extracted from the triple store, employing semantic relationships to discern patterns and anomalies within the data. Notably, this capability was exemplified by the identification of correlations between a football game and a COVID-19 event occurring at the same location and time.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The framework showcased its capability to address intricate, multi-domain queries and support diverse levels of detail. Additionally, it demonstrated proficiency in data analysis and visualization, generating graphs that depict patterns and trends; however, challenges related to ontology maintenance, alignment, and mapping must be addressed for the approach's optimal utilization.",Guru Rao S; Rokkam P; Zhang B; Sargsyan A; Kaladharan A; Sethumadhavan P; Jacobs M; Hofmann-Apitius M; Tom Kodamullil A,"Department of Bioinformatics, Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI), Schloss Birlinghoven, Sankt Augustin, 53757, Germany. sathvik.guru.rao@scai.fraunhofer.de.",Journal of biomedical semantics,2025-09-15,10.1186/s13326-025-00338-1,4.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Data integration; Ontology; Semantic Web; Data Interoperability; Semantic Framework; Web Of Data; Public Health Intelligence

40947458,"Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in hepatocellular carcinoma: a comprehensive review of diagnostic, surveillance, and treatment response prediction and assessment.","Gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a pivotal imaging modality in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management, offering unique advantages owing to its hepatocyte-specific contrast properties. Its technical foundation includes optimized dynamic phase imaging and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) acquisition, which together provide functional information unattainable with conventional extracellular contrast agents. This modality enhances sensitivity in detecting HCC and enables superior characterization of focal liver lesions based on hepatocyte-specific uptake patterns. In high-risk patients with chronic liver disease, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI facilitates the early detection of small and early-stage HCCs, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical outcomes. Beyond diagnosis, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI aids in predicting treatment response by evaluating tumor biological characteristics. Key imaging biomarkers include: hyperintense or heterogeneous HCC on HBP, suggesting tumor immune microenvironment; peritumoral hypointensity on HBP, suggesting microvascular invasion; and clear hypointensity on HBP with several other findings, indicating vessels encapsulating tumor clusters, characteristic of the macrotrabecular-massive HCC subtype. These biomarkers support a comprehensive evaluation of histological differentiation and biological aggressiveness. Furthermore, this modality demonstrates superior accuracy in assessing local therapy effectiveness and monitoring systemic treatment responses compared to conventional imaging. Major international hepatology societies have incorporated gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI into their HCC diagnostic algorithms, albeit with regional differences in emphasis. Eastern guidelines (e.g., from the Japan Society of Hepatology and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver) prioritize sensitivity, whereas Western guidelines (e.g., from the European Association for the Study of the Liver and the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) emphasize specificity. Despite certain limitations, including potential suboptimal arterial phase visualization, challenges in interpreting the transitional phase, higher cost, and longer examination times, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI remains an indispensable tool in precision oncology, enabling personalized treatment strategies and supporting optimal patient outcomes through comprehensive HCC characterization and accurate treatment monitoring.",Ozaki K; Tanahashi Y; Goshima S,"Department of Radiology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1, Handayama, Chuo-ku, Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan. ozakik-rad@umin.org.",Japanese journal of radiology,2025-09-15,10.1007/s11604-025-01870-x,4.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Hepatocellular carcinoma; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Gadoxetic Acid; Hepatobiliary Phase; Liver Imaging Reporting And Data System

The encoder was modified into a local-global feature fusion architecture that extracts multi-scale features from intermediate transformer layers, preserving fine structural details while maintaining computational efficiency. A lightweight decoder with progressive up-sampling and skip connections was employed to generate high-resolution images, addressing limitations of conventional U-Net architectures.&#xD;&#xD;Main Results:&#xD;We collected a dataset of 50 EAT scans-each with 120 views-for a total of 6000 views. These were acquired from water phantoms and tissue samples under varied electrode configurations and voltages, and split into training (30 scans, 3600 views), validation (10 scans, 1200 views), and testing (10 scans, 1200 views). Our model significantly outperformed baseline 3D U-Nets, achieving an RMSE of 0.0092, PSNR of 41.10, and SSIM of 0.9377. Remarkably, our method reconstructs a full-view 3D EAT image from a single view in just 2 seconds, demonstrating its potential for near real-time monitoring and adaptive dose verification in electroporation-based therapies.&#xD;&#xD;Significance:&#xD;This is the first application of a large foundation model like SAM-Med3D for enhancing 3D EAT imaging.

Mass testing performed by different assays represents an essential strategy to control virus spread, especially in low-income regions. This study aimed to standardize and validate RT-LAMP as an alternative tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Different sets of primers were assessed in silico and in vitro, and the N2 target was selected for the validation stage. The extracted RNA from the clinical samples was used to standardize the RT-LAMP fluorometric assay with BST 3.0 and RT enzymes, and the colorimetric assay was performed with WarmStart<sup>®</sup> Colorimetric LAMP Master Mix. Clinical samples were also subjected to the Wondfo 2019-nCoV antigen test. The proposed protocols showed robust diagnostic accuracy in high-viral-load samples (C<sub>T</sub> ≤ 30), 98.25% sensitivity and 90.91% specificity for fluorometric assay, and 92.98% sensitivity and 100% specificity for colorimetric assay. Considering the two visualization techniques, the fluorometric technique yielded more accordant results. In contrast, the rapid antigen test presented a lower performance, with 82.46% sensitivity and 100% specificity in samples with a C<sub>T</sub> score ≤ 30. RT-LAMP visualization with a simple ultraviolet light source showed high sensitivity in active infection patient samples.

40974713,Bio-inspired ultrasonic microreactor for efficient synthesis of indigo-emitting carbon dots with tunable morphology and enhanced optical properties.,"Carbon dots (CDs) are promising fluorescent nanomaterials with broad applications in optoelectronics, healthcare, and artificial photosynthesis. However, synthesizing indigo-emitting CDs with optimal properties remains challenging due to the inefficiencies and complexity of conventional methods. This study introduces a high-performance ultrasonic microreactor inspired by biomimetic leaf vein structures to enhance CD synthesis efficiency. We developed a COMSOL Multiphysics-based optimization framework to improve flow field uniformity and examine transport dynamics within the microchannel. This framework identified key parameters, including leaf vein contours, fractal angles, depth-to-width ratios, and inlet configurations, that govern flow characteristics. Additionally, we optimized ultrasonic energy transfer by directly coupling the transducer with the microreactor, determining the optimal frequency (21 kHz) and power (100 W) for maximum reactor performance. Visualization experiments revealed how ultrasound regulates bubble dynamics, enhancing interfacial area and stabilizing suspension behavior. Using this optimized system, we synthesized indigo-emitting CDs with a maximum PLQY of 27.5 % and a narrow FWHM of ∼78 nm under 365 nm excitation. Multivariate experiments revealed how flow velocity, reaction temperature, and ultrasonic modulation influence the optical properties of the CDs.

40973460,Photon-Counting Computed Tomography for Evaluation of Coiled Intracranial Aneurysms.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Intracranial aneurysms treated with endovascular embolization often require surveillance imaging using digital subtraction angiography, an invasive, risky, and expensive procedure. Existing non-invasive imaging modalities (standard computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance [MR] angiography) are often unsatisfactory for evaluating treated aneurysm due to artifacts from embolization devices. The objective of the present study was to determine whether photon-counting computer tomography (PCCT) imaging parameters could be optimized to confer satisfactory imaging resolution in an anthropomorphic phantom of treated intracranial aneurysms.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Phantom studies were performed using a model of the major intracranial arteries with appropriately sized, endovascularly treated middle cerebral artery (coil embolization) and basilar artery (woven endobridge [WEB] embolization) aneurysms. A series of imaging acquisition procedures were performed using a conventional energy-integrating CT (EICT) scanner and a photon-counting CT (PCCT) scanner. Key imaging acquisition and reconstruction parameters were varied to identify the optimum protocol for treated aneurysm characterization. Artifact reduction was performed on all images using the Siemens iterative metal artifact reduction (iMAR) algorithm. Contrast-to-noise ratio and metal artifact magnitude were quantitatively analyzed and displayed in tabular form to provide objective criteria for determination of optimal processing parameters for treated aneurysm visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Imaging was successfully obtained in phantom studies across a range of imaging parameters. Quantitative metal artifact magnitude was greater for 100keV virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) and lowest for 55 keV VMIs without iMAR, but this trend was reversed with iMAR applied. The 55 keV VMI was chosen as the optimal reconstruction parameter for visualization of treated intracranial aneurysms as it demonstrated low magnitude of metal artifacts and the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in adjacent vasculature. Similarly, CNR of the largest vessel adjacent to the coil mass was increased for all images after iMAR was applied. CNR was highest in the 55 keV VMR images both before (3.61±0.14) and after (6.82±0.34) application of iMAR.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Virtual monoenergetic images combined with metal artifact reduction algorithms created from PCCT scans conferred excellent visualization of previously-treated intracranial aneurysms and adjacent vasculature.

40970286,Effect of Perforator Territory Infarction on Functional Outcome in Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion.,"<h4>Background</h4>Knowledge of the anatomic distribution of cerebral perforating arteries and the consequences of ischemia in these territories is limited. This study aims to evaluate the effect of perforator territory ischemia on functional outcome in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion.<h4>Methods</h4>A post hoc analysis of the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands, MR CLEAN-MED and NO IV participants, recruited between January 2018 and January 2021 from 20 European stroke centers, was performed. Patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion with available posttreatment magnetic resonance imaging were included. Patients were assigned to 3 groups based on infarct location identified on ≤24 hours posttreatment magnetic resonance imaging: cortex group, perforator and insular group, and both groups (cortical alongside insular and perforator territory). Multivariable linear and ordinal regression analyses were performed separately with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at 24 hours as the primary outcome and modified Rankin Scale at 90 days as the secondary outcome, adjusted for baseline scores and prognostic factors.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 1167 patients, a total of 397 were included. The median age was 71 (interquartile range, 62-79), and 204 (51%) were men. Although no significant association was found in multivariable analysis between perforator territory infarctions and 24 hours National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, patients with perforator territory ischemia were more likely to have a worse 90-days modified Rankin Scale (median modified Rankin Scale, 2 [interquartile range, 1-3]; common odds ratio, 2.94 [95% CI, 1.73-4.98]). Besides infarct locations, Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade 2B-3 and Heidelberg bleeding classifications 1c and 2 significantly influenced the 24-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and 90-day modified Rankin Scale outcomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion leading to perforator territory infarctions are more likely to have an unfavorable functional outcome at 90 days.

40961121,Correlations between the prescribing patterns of psychotropic medications and socio-economic factors during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional Swedish registry study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profoundly negative impact on all societal sectors, public health systems, and state economies. The pandemic led to high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and substance abuse, while the impact on changes in psychotropic medication prescribing was complex. Despite less restrictive measures in the first stage of the pandemic, Sweden experienced significant mental health consequences and changes in psychotropic medication prescribing.<h4>Aim</h4>This study aimed to characterize the different psychotropic medication prescribing patterns (antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, and drugs used in addictive disorders: nicotine, alcohol, and opioid dependence) at regional levels and investigate the correlations of disease spread and socio-economic factors with the Swedish regional prescribing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic.<h4>Methods</h4>We employed an observational and retrospective design, incorporating time-series analysis, spatial visualization, and regression analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The prescribing of anxiolytics and drugs used in addictive disorders decreased during the pandemic, with the most striking reductions seen in medications used for nicotine dependence. Considerable regional variations were observed across Sweden during the pandemic years, with antidepressant prescribing increasing slightly, and hypnotics and sedatives showing a relatively stable trend. None of the four key variables of disease spread and socio-economic factors showed a statistically significant correlation with the changes in the prescribing of drugs used for nicotine dependence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study demonstrated differentiated changes in psychotropic medication prescribing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. We found a pandemic effect on nicotine dependence drug prescribing, which the key variables could not explain. Targeted mental health interventions and specific regional health policies should be developed to reduce disparities and address regional variations during future health emergencies.",Ei D; Brådvik G; Lindgren P; Barach P; Bochenek T,"Department of Nutrition and Drug Research, Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.",PloS one,2025-09-17,10.1371/journal.pone.0330081,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

We compare image quality, visibility of IAC anatomy, and cochlear measurements at 0.55 T vs. 1.5T/3T.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this IRB-approved retrospective study, 25 patients who underwent 0.55 T MRI using IAC protocol with prior/ subsequent comparative scans at 1.5T/3T scans were selected. A subset (n=13) also had high-resolution CT (HRCT). 3 board-certified neuroradiologists independently scored the visibility of anatomical structures and overall image quality on a 4-point Likert scale in one non-pathological ear. Readers also measured cochlear length, cochlear width, and IAC width on double oblique coronal images.<h4>Results</h4>All three readers rated the visualization of anatomic structures as clinically acceptable (scores ≥ 2) at 0.55 T. Two of the three readers reported no significant difference in visualization of these structures between 0.55 T and higher field strengths. Quantitative measurements (cochlear length, width, and IAC width) at 0.55 T were comparable to 1.5T/3T. One reader (R2) rated overall image quality significantly lower at 0.55 T (mean score: 3.1 at 0.55 T vs. 2.6 at HF; p = 0.005).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Clinical evaluation of IAC and inner ear structures using a 3D T2w SPACE sequence at 0.55 T is an acceptable alternative to imaging at conventional field strengths of 1.5/3T.",Rajeev R; Kelsey LJ; Seiberlich N; Srinivasan A; Ibrahim M; Liao E; Masotti M; Perera C; Gulani V; Bapuraj J; Mishra S,"Department of Radiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (R.R., L.J.K., N.S., A.S., M.I., E.L., V.G., J.B., S.M.).

This study evaluates the clinical outcomes of combining IUS with EPSiT in the treatment of complex and recurrent PD.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A retrospective cohort, single-center study was conducted on patients with recurrent and complex PD treated between 2018 and 2021 using IUS in conjunction with EPSiT. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 36 months. The study recorded the number of cases in which IUS identified additional fistulous tracts and led to a modification of the surgical strategy, as well as clinical outcomes including recurrence rate, time to wound healing, and incidence of incomplete wound healing.<h4>Results</h4>Nineteen patients were included (14 males, 73.7%; mean age of 35.4 ± 6.4 years). The mean operative time was 42 min, with IUS requiring an additional 6 min. IUS identified previously undetected fistulous tracts in 6 patients (31.5%), leading to modifications in the surgical strategy. At 36-month follow-up, disease persistence (recurrence or incomplete healing) was observed in 5 patients (26.3%). Recurrent cases were successfully managed with additional procedures, achieving 100% healing after reintervention.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Intraoperative IUS identified previously undetected secondary tracts in 31.5% of patients, leading to a modification of the surgical approach. Further comparative studies are needed to validate its effectiveness and assess its potential role as a standard adjunct in the surgical management of pilonidal disease.",Gallo G; Goglia M; De Simone V; Gravante G; Sileri P; Crucitti A; La Torre M,"Department of Surgery, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy. ga.gallo@uniroma1.it.",International journal of colorectal disease,2025-09-20,10.1007/s00384-025-04961-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Pilonidal Disease; Single-center Study; Intra-operative Ultrasound
40328243,Contrast Agent-Specific Parameter Optimization for T 1 -Weighted Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo Imaging : Use Cases for Gadoterate Meglumine and Gadobutrol at 1.5T and 3.0T.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study is to derive a contrast agent-specific theoretical framework to optimize acquisition parameters for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the physiochemical properties of gadolinium-based contrast agents, focusing on fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences. The goal is to enhance the lesion-to-background contrast for improved diagnostic sensitivity in clinical applications.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Signal equations for fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences were derived for nonenhancing and enhancing tissues using gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol, characterized by distinct longitudinal (r 1 ) and transverse (r 2 /r* 2 ) relaxivities. Simulations were conducted at 2 field strengths, 1.5T and 3.0T, and various scenarios were considered, including hypothetical lesions with T 1 ratios ranging from 1.1 to 1.8. The signal behavior was analyzed across a range of initial conditions, including different spin densities and field-strength dependent variations in tissue relaxation times. The optimal flip angle and repetition time combinations were determined to maximize contrast. In vivo validation was performed on 2 patients undergoing contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain, using the proposed acquisition parameters.<h4>Results</h4>The modeling and simulations revealed that the flip angle that maximizes signal intensity for a contrast-enhancing lesion (Ernst angle) differs from the flip angle that maximizes T 1 -dependent contrast between lesion and healthy tissue in unenhanced MRI (Pelc angle) and also differs from the flip angle that maximizes the same in contrast-enhanced MRI. The theoretical simulations indicated possible contrast gains of 24%-28% using optimized parameters. The in vivo acquisitions demonstrated contrast gains of 19%-44% for a diffuse enhancing lesion and 91% for a weakly enhancing focal lesion, when comparing the optimized acquisition parameters to manufacturer's default settings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Adjusted repetition time and flip angle values, derived using the proposed framework, improved the image contrast between healthy and diseased tissues, enhancing the visualization of abnormalities. This approach can be used to optimize routine clinical MRI protocols and balance scan time with contrast enhancement. This may translate to more precise lesion detection, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis or treatment monitoring in clinical practice.",Gkotsis DE; Bherwani A; Kapsalaki EZ; Bishop CJ; Schwarz AJ,"GE HealthCare, Pharmaceutical Diagnostics, London, United Kingdom (D.E.G., A.B., C.J.B., A.J.S.); Radiology Department, Diagnostic Center Euromedica, Athens, Greece (E.Z.K.); and Department of Radiology, University of Thessaly, School of Medicine, Larissa, Greece (E.Z.K.).",Investigative radiology,2025-09-17,10.1097/rli.0000000000001205,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Parameter optimization; Contrast-enhanced Mri; Gadolinium-based Contrast Agents; Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo Imaging
40962233,A novel robotic arm-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection platform with augmented traction for gastric neoplasms: a first-in-human prospective pilot study (with videos).,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>Robotic arm-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection (R-ESD) facilitates visualization of the submucosal dissection plane and aids complete tumor resection. However, the practicality of a robotic arm for gastric neoplasms remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of minimally invasive gastric R-ESD.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 15 consecutive patients who underwent R-ESD between June 2024 and September 2024 at the Korea University Medical Center were prospectively enrolled and analyzed. The primary outcome was en bloc resection.<h4>Results</h4>All patients underwent both en bloc and R0 resections (100%). The majority of tumors (73.3%) were located in the lower third of the stomach (34.7 ± 5.8 mm) and were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma (53.3%) or low-grade adenoma (47.7%). The mean total procedure time (TPT) was 28.8 min and the median robot-assisted dissection time (RDT) was 14.3 min, achieving a dissection speed of 48.2 mm<sup>2</sup>/min. Specimen injury was occurred in four cases (26.7%). The robotic arm conducted a median of 3.9 grasps per procedure, with an RDT/TPT ratio of 53.8%. A comparison between lower and middle/upper lesions revealed an increased pattern of RDT, grasps and RDT/TPT ratio. The total NASA-TLX score was strongly correlated with the number of grasps, RDT/TPT ratio and TPT.<h4>Conclusions</h4>R-ESD proved feasible and safe in gastric ESD through high en bloc resection rates and dissection speed. R-ESD holds promise for improving procedural safety and performance through augmented traction.",Jeon HJ; Keum B; Lee B; Kim S; Choi HS; Lee JM; Kim ES; Jeen YT; Lee HS; Chun HJ,"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2025-09-15,10.1016/j.gie.2025.09.012,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Gastric neoplasms; Gastroscopy; TRACTION; Robotics; Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection
40960845,First-in-Human Real-Time MR-Guided Ventricular Ablation for Idiopathic Outflow Tract Premature Ventricular Complexes.,"<h4>Importance</h4>Catheter ablation is a cornerstone therapy for symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, yet current techniques rely on fluoroscopy and electroanatomic mapping, which provide limited soft-tissue detail and expose patients and staff to ionizing radiation. Real-time magnetic resonance (MR)-guided ablation may overcome these limitations by enabling direct visualization of cardiac anatomy, substrate, and lesion formation, all within a radiation-free environment.<h4>Objective</h4>To demonstrate the technical feasibility and safety of the first-in-human real-time MR-guided radiofrequency ventricular ablation procedure.<h4>Design, setting, and participant</h4>This was a prospective, worldwide-first roll-in case from the ongoing VISABL-VT nonrandomized clinical trial assessing MR-guided radiofrequency ablation of ventricular tachycardia. The procedure and analysis were performed in April 2025 at an academic tertiary care center equipped with a standard 1.5-T MR imaging (MRI) suite and dedicated MR-compatible electrophysiology platform, MR-compatible 12-lead electrocardiographic monitoring and recording system, MR-conditional defibrillator, and real-time catheter tracking integrated with the MRI scanner for synchronized imaging and ablation. The patient was a 73-year-old man with symptomatic, drug-refractory outflow tract premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).<h4>Intervention</h4>The ablation was performed under general anesthesia inside the MRI scanner. Intraprocedurally acquired noncontrast 3-dimensional MR angiographic imaging was used to create an anatomical roadmap for the procedure. Real-time catheter tracking and activation mapping were performed using actively tracked diagnostic and ablation catheters. Mapping identified earliest activation first in the posterior septal right ventricular outflow tract, where ablation transiently suppressed PVCs. Ectopy recurred but was ultimately resolved by ablation performed via a retrograde aortic approach in the left coronary cusp. Lesion formation was confirmed via postprocedural MRI.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Suppression of PVCs and presence or absence of procedural complications.<h4>Results</h4>The procedure was performed under real-time MRI guidance without complications. PVCs were completely suppressed, with no recurrence during 30-minute observation or at 2-month follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This first-in-human case demonstrates that ventricular ablation can be safely and effectively performed entirely under real-time MR guidance. Further evidence from the VISABL-VT trial will clarify clinical utility and long-term outcomes.",Götte MJW; Hopman LHGA; Bhagirath P; Kemme MJB; Nelissen JL; Lindborg K; Krafft AJ; Sprengers MES; Chamuleau SAJ; Allaart CP,"Department of Cardiology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.",JAMA cardiology,2025-09-17,10.1001/jamacardio.2025.3000,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40952353,Multifunctional Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@PDA Nanocomposite-Based Sensitive Dual-Mode Lateral Flow Immunoassay for the Simultaneous Detection of Two Antibodies against Respiratory Tract Pathogens.,"Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> (<i>M. pneumoniae</i>) and <i>Chlamydia pneumoniae</i> (<i>C. pneumoniae</i>) being major pathogens responsible for community-acquired respiratory infections. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical for improving patient outcomes and effectively controlling disease transmission. Herein, we report a novel dual-channel lateral flow immunoassay (DC-LFIA) platform based on the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@polydopamine (PDA) nanocomposite with outstanding extinction coefficient, oxidase-like activity, and magnetic properties for the simultaneous detection of specific IgM antibodies (Ab) against these two pathogens in human serum. The magnetic properties of the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@PDA nanocomposite enable rapid enrichment of trace target Abs from large-volume serum samples, with a high extinction coefficient for direct colorimetric visualization and an excellent oxidase-like catalytic activity for signal enhancement. On the basis of the multifunctional Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@PDA nanocomposite, rapid dual-mode detection of serum Abs was achieved within 12 min. By the direct colorimetric mode, the visual limit of detection (vLOD) for <i>M. pneumoniae</i> Ab and <i>C. pneumoniae</i> Ab reached 2 and 1 ng/mL, respectively, while the oxidase-like catalyzing signal amplification mode further lowered the vLODs to 0.2 and 0.1 ng/mL, accordingly. Additionally, the signal normalization using a 3D-printed device significantly enhanced assay accuracy and reproducibility. When applied to 96 clinical serum samples, compared to commercial kits, this multifunctional Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@PDA-based DC-LFIA demonstrated superior performance, providing a reliable approach for simultaneous antibody detection in respiratory infection diagnosis. Overall, this work contributes a valuable diagnostic tool to the field of rapid detection of ARIs.",Dong T; Sun G; Liu W; Long Y; Liu A,"Institute for Chemical Biology and Biosensing, College of Life Sciences, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China.",Analytical chemistry,2025-09-15,10.1021/acs.analchem.5c03616,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40953439,TruVox Web-Based Software for Vocal Pitch Training in Transgender Women: Development and Single-Session Evaluations.,"<h4>Background</h4>Transgender people often experience distress due to a mismatch between their gender and the way their voice is perceived (eg, transgender women with low pitch), which significantly reduces their mental health and quality of life. This is especially a problem for transfeminine people and can be reduced with gender-affirming voice training (GAVT), but such training is often inaccessible due to factors such as price and geographical constraints.<h4>Objective</h4>We aim to improve the limited availability of GAVT by developing and testing a free web-based software platform (named TruVox; University of Cincinnati) that would combine real-time feedback about the user's voice with structured vocal pitch exercises for transfeminine people.<h4>Methods</h4>The current publicly accessible TruVox prototype focuses on vocal pitch training with 5 structured exercises that provide real-time pitch visualizations as well as supporting videos and text. It was tested in 2 evaluation stages: initial remote usability evaluations and a later single-session in-person evaluation with 21 transfeminine participants under the supervision of 2 researchers. In remote evaluations, participants reported bugs and usability issues that were iteratively addressed. In the in-person evaluation, participants tested the final software prototype and filled out the System Usability Scale, then performed 10 repetitions of different exercises to gauge performance improvement with practice. They also filled out the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for each exercise.<h4>Results</h4>The System Usability Scale score had a mean of 79.8 (SD 12.8) on a 100-point scale, Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scores were high (eg, interest/enjoyment over 11/14), and exercise performance significantly improved in all but 1 exercise (P values ranging from below .001 to .095). As qualitative feedback, participants requested to be able to use the software without much preparation and suggested several desirable future features, such as performance tracking and goal-setting.<h4>Conclusions</h4>While the pitch training module should not be considered a complete GAVT package, TruVox represents a promising foundation for further GAVT software because it was perceived as usable and motivating and allowed participants to improve their exercise performance. To our knowledge, TruVox is the first GAVT software that combines real-time voice visualization with structured exercises, and this study represents the first quantitative human subjects evaluation of GAVT software. In the future, TruVox will be expanded with additional modules such as resonance training, then tested in longer-term trials.",Weese SR; Wilkens ME; Jadhav O; Wang X; Bhanushali A; DiLoreto T; Kozel R; Gustin RL; McAllister T; McKenna VS; Novak VD,"University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, United States.",JMIR formative research,2025-09-15,10.2196/73841,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Mobile phone; Voice Training; Usability; User Experience; Serious Games; Transgender Health; Exercise Technologies
40962364,"Enhancing senior physician-led multidisciplinary team rounds to improve patient care at Wallaga University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, 2025.","<h4>Background</h4>The healthcare system is facing challenges due to insufficient multidisciplinary collaboration, leading to gaps in treatment, compromised patient safety and increased medical errors. Poor communication can cause misunderstandings, delays in critical decisions and cost escalation. Implementing multidisciplinary team (MDT) rounds, led by a senior physician, can improve communication, streamline decision-making and improve patient care.<h4>Methods</h4>A multidimensional interventional study was conducted to address the identified problem. A fishbone diagram was used to identify the root causes of the problem. A driver diagram was developed to outline the key drivers and change concepts necessary for achieving the desired outcomes. Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were implemented to test and refine interventions systematically.<h4>Intervention</h4>A daily dashboard-based performance audit was implemented, which includes the status of MDT rounds recorded by unit heads and analysed by the Hospital SBFR Taskforce team. Both morning and evening round statuses from various service units are collected for review of the data and communication with department heads prior to morning sessions. The report is shared in a common Telegram group for accessibility among hospital leaders. Each service unit engages in discussions with their MDT every Friday, while a weekly SBFR forum takes place every Tuesday, attended by directors and representatives from service units to review weekly performance. On-site MDT supportive supervision is conducted as needed.<h4>Results</h4>Senior physician engagement has significantly improved overall, as evidenced by the average score rising from 49% to 81%. Furthermore, 94% of participants agreed that senior-led MDT rounds were good for teamwork, professional development and discussion quality. Additionally, improvements in patient outcomes and decision-making were acknowledged by 80% of respondents and 97% of participants, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study indicates that senior-led MDT rounds enhance discussion quality, team collaboration, decision-making, patient outcomes and professional growth. To maintain MDT rounds, daily performance audits, clinical audits and continuous monitoring using common communication platforms are recommended.",Bayisa G; Edessa D; Deyasa M; Gobena G; Obsa D; Tilahun T; Shibiru T; Takele A; Abera C; Tigabe E,"Public Health, Wollega University, Zone, Ethiopia gedefa2019@gmail.com.",BMJ open quality,2025-09-16,10.1136/bmjoq-2025-003429,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Quality improvement; Decision Making; Pdsa
40966532,Improving Mental Health Referral Systems in Rural Australia: Co-Design Study With Health Professionals and Consumers.,"<h4>Background</h4>In rural Australia, geographical isolation, limited resources, and complex health care navigation create significant barriers to mental health care access. Mental health care professionals and organizations often work in segregation, exacerbating existing barriers. Digital technology provides an opportunity to improve communication between providers and streamline workflows while supporting a diverse range of consumers.<h4>Objective</h4>This co-design study aimed to identify rural community needs and explore digital solutions to enhance mental health service delivery pathways.<h4>Methods</h4>Using a design-thinking methodology, we conducted focus groups and workshops with 17 participants (7 consumers and caregivers and 10 health care professionals) from a rural region to understand mental health service needs, systemic challenges, and design potential digital solutions. Thematic analysis followed a grounded theory approach, involving systematic coding and theme development through an iterative consensus process.<h4>Results</h4>Access to mental health care emerged as the central theme. Rural community participants reported strong community connections but faced challenges, including limited technological innovation and substantial travel burdens. Health care professionals highlighted critical systemic pressures: underresourcing, overwhelmed clinicians with extensive waitlists, and complex referral processes. Both groups identified overlapping barriers in service limitations and system navigation. During the design phase, we developed personas capturing consumer and health care professional experiences and conceptualized an integrated digital solution comprising a health care professional dashboard and a consumer-facing app with caregiver access to enhance service coordination.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study demonstrated strong stakeholder support for implementing an integrated digital solution to enhance rural mental health service delivery.
