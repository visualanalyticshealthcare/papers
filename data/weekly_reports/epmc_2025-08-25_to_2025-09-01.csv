40856615,A silicone adhesive with ultralong room-temperature phosphorescence for direct damage visualization. ,"Visual detection of early-stage microdamage is crucial for structural health monitoring to avoid catastrophic failures and extend equipment durability. However, current detection approaches are hampered by complex multi-component formulations and harsh operational requirements, making facile in situ microdamage visualization challenging. Herein, we report a novel room temperature phosphorescent adhesive (RTPA) via dynamic B-O bonds, achieving persistent phosphorescence emission in commercial adhesive systems. The resulting RTPAs exhibit ultralong phosphorescence lifetimes (up to 1.931 s) under ambient conditions, surpassing those of all reported RTP-based adhesives. As a silicone-based adhesive, the RTPA possesses versatile adhesion capability for various substrates, ranging from metals, inorganic compounds to polymers. More importantly, leveraging ultralong-lived phosphorescence emission in the dark, RTPAs enable in situ visual detection of microdamage in bonded substrates such as glasses. Therefore, such advantages make RTPAs promising candidates for damage visualization, anti-counterfeiting adhesives and information encryption.",Li N; Gu S; Wu Q; Wu J,"College of Polymer Science and Engineering, National Key Laboratory of Advanced Polymer Materials, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China. wuqi57@scu.edu.cn.",Materials horizons,2025-08-26,10.1039/d5mh01227a,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",
40857710,Technical Description of eHealth Tools in an Environmental Exposure Chamber: Implementation Study. ,"Environmental exposure chambers (EECs) provide a controlled and reproducible setting for studying allergic rhinitis, allowing standardized exposure to aeroallergens. However, real-time symptom monitoring remains challenging, particularly as patients must be observed remotely while inside the chamber. This study aimed to design, implement, and evaluate an integrated eHealth system that leverages digital tools for data collection and real-time clinical monitoring during EEC exposures. The goal was to streamline workflow, enhance data reliability, and improve patient safety during allergen challenges. We conducted a prospective pilot study in a validated EEC at Ramón y Cajal University Hospital. A total of 34 provocation tests were conducted: 27 in patients with confirmed grass pollen allergy and 7 in nonallergic controls. All exposures took place outside the pollen season using standardized Phleum pratense (grass pollen) at concentrations of 940±100 grains/m³. Clinical data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University), a secure electronic data capture platform. Surveys were automatically scheduled and included standardized instruments: Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS), asthma symptom questionnaires, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF). Data were visualized in real time using Power BI dashboards (Microsoft Corp). Among allergic patients, 85% had a positive response to the allergen exposure, with a median TNSS of 6 (IQR 6-7), while controls showed no positive reactions. Mean exposure time for positive cases was 48.9 minutes (SD 28.3), as patients were withdrawn early upon reaching symptom thresholds. The REDCap system was configured to collect symptom surveys at 15-minute intervals, allowing up to 6 entries per patient during exposure, depending on clinical tolerance. This setup enabled consistent symptom monitoring and integration with Power BI for real-time visualization. All records were successfully synchronized between REDCap and Power BI. Informal feedback from medical staff highlighted improved workflow and usability. The integration of REDCap with Power BI enabled automated, real-time tracking of symptoms during EEC exposures. This eHealth solution enhanced clinical oversight, supported timely decision-making, and ensured patient safety. The platform provides a flexible and reproducible model for use in allergen exposure studies and other clinical settings requiring structured remote monitoring. Clinical response data are reported in a separate validation study.",Garcia-Gutierrez I; Dueñas-Requena I; Sanchez-Garcia V; Solorzano-Zepeda C; Santos-Benito S; de la Hoz-Caballer B; Antolin-Amerigo D,"Allergy Department, Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital, Santander, Spain.",JMIR formative research,2025-08-26,10.2196/71276,4.5,visualization(abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40854187,Mapping Hot Spots and Global Research Trends in Exergaming Between 1997 and 2024: Bibliometric Analysis. ,"Exergaming, the combination of exercise and gaming, has emerged as an important area in physical activity (PA) research. By leveraging advances in video game technology, exergaming supports both physical and mental health. This growing interest in exergaming has increasingly attracted researchers over the years. Examining the development of exergaming research with a bibliometric approach is thought to offer valuable perspectives to researchers by revealing the trends and main contributions in the field. This study aims to identify the most researched concepts and topics in the field of exergaming; track the changes of trending topics over the years; identify the most influential journals as well as the authors who have contributed the most to the field; identify groundbreaking studies and neglected topics that shape future work; and reveal the countries, institutions, and collaborations that have contributed the most to the field. It also aims to identify research gaps in the field of exergaming and provide important recommendations for future research. A bibliometric analysis covering studies between 1997 and 2024 was conducted using the Web of Science database. The R-based Bibliometrix package and the Biblioshiny web interface were used for data analysis and visualization. The analysis included original research papers and reviews. These analyses provided insights into research trends, citation metrics, and thematic developments. A total of 1626 studies were analyzed, and the results indicated a steep rise in exergaming research since 2015, peaking in the years 2020-2021. Major high-impact journals publishing in this area include Games for Health Journal and International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. Researchers who have contributed significantly and enriched the knowledge base of the exergaming field included Gao Zan, Eling de Bruin, and Zeng Nan. The most cited studies were classified into 2 different clusters, namely, cluster 1 that focuses on the concepts of PA, exercise, energy expenditure, and children, while cluster 2 focuses on rehabilitation, balance, adults, and aging. Medicine, information technology, and intention are some of the emerging themes. From a research productivity perspective, there is an undisputed front-runner, the United States, but substantial contributions have definitely come from either the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology or the Karolinska Institute. Despite significant growth in exergaming research over the last decade, research gaps remain, particularly in understanding how exergaming can be effectively integrated into long-term PA promotion and broader health outcomes. These gaps were identified by the absence or low representation of relevant keywords (eg, ""cost-effectiveness,"" ""community-based intervention,"" and ""long-term health outcomes"") in thematic mapping and keyword trend analyses and limited citation density in these areas. Future work should explore these issues more systematically to advance the field.",Kayhan A; Kose E; Kayhan B; Zeng N,"Department of Recreation, Faculty of Sport Sciences, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.",Interactive journal of medical research,2025-08-25,10.2196/66738,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40858650,Optimized deep learning for brain tumor detection: a hybrid approach with attention mechanisms and clinical explainability. ,"Brain tumor classification (BTC) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical diagnosis task, which is highly important for treatment planning. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning (DL) model that integrates VGG16, an attention mechanism, and optimized hyperparameters to classify brain tumors into different categories as glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The approach leverages state-of-the-art preprocessing techniques, transfer learning, and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization on a dataset of 7023 MRI images to enhance both performance and interpretability. The proposed model achieves 99% test accuracy and impressive precision and recall figures and outperforms traditional approaches like Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by a significant margin. Moreover, the model eliminates the need for manual labelling-a common challenge in this domain-by employing end-to-end learning, which allows the proposed model to derive meaningful features hence reducing human input. The integration of attention mechanisms further promote feature selection, in turn improving classification accuracy, while Grad-CAM visualizations show which regions of the image had the greatest impact on classification decisions, leading to increased transparency in clinical settings. Overall, the synergy of superior prediction, automatic feature extraction, and improved predictability confirms the model as an important application to neural networks approaches for brain tumor classification with valuable potential for enhancing medical imaging (MI) and clinical decision-making.",Aiya AJ; Wani N; Ramani M; Kumar A; Pant S; Kotecha K; Kulkarni A; Al-Danakh A,"School of Computer Science Engineering and Applications, D Y Patil International University (DYPIU), Akrudi, Pune, 411044, Maharashtra, India.",Scientific reports,2025-08-26,10.1038/s41598-025-04591-3,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40856882,Fibroblast activation protein expression in the tumor microenvironment is crucial in survival prediction and differentiation of recurrent gliomas: a head-to-head comparison of <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI-04 and <sup>18</sup>F-FET in PET/CT imaging. ,"The precise differentiation of recurrent glioma from treatment-related changes, such as pseudoprogression or radiation necrosis, is essential for treatment planning and remains a significant challenge. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts can be targeted with PET tracers for in vivo visualization and quantification. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic effectiveness of FAP expression in patients with potential recurrent glioma by directly comparing [gallium-68] FAP inhibitor-04 and [fluorine-18] fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine PET/CT imaging. Thirty glioma patients showing signs of possible recurrence during routine MRI follow-up after treatment were enrolled. PET-based semiquantitative parameters, clinical factors, and survival data were collected for analysis. Paired comparison of SUVmax, TBRmax, MTV, and TLU originating from two PET imaging studies indicated significant differences in TBRmax, MTV, and TLU, with P values of 0.000, 0.001, and 0.000, respectively. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed a marginally non-significant difference in efficacy (P = 0.053) of the initial pathological diagnosis. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, PET parameters, initial pathological data, age, and gender were used to develop the predictive models step by step. Although trends towards significance were observed in the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio, no PET parameters reached statistical significance. The MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). When PET parameters and initial pathological diagnosis were included, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio significantly enhanced the model's AUC (P = 0.040) from 0.709 (0.465-0.953, 95% CI) to 0.847 (0.688-1.000, 95% CI). When replacing the initial diagnosis with initial WHO grade, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio improved the AUC (P = 0.016) from 0.640 (0.400-0.880, 95% CI) to 0.852 (0.715-0.988, 95% CI). After factoring in age and gender in addition to the initial pathological diagnosis, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio enhanced the AUC (P = 0.039) from 0.841 (0.677-1.000, 95% CI) to 0.963 (0.887-1.000, 95% CI). Similarly, after replacing the initial pathological diagnosis with the initial WHO grade, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio significantly enhanced the AUC of the model (P = 0.046) from 0.762 (0.532-0.992, 95% CI) to 0.942 (0.850-1.000, 95% CI). The survival analysis revealed that the MTV-FAPI of the lesion has a significant impact on overall survival (P = 0.027, hazard ratio = 1.103, 95% CI: 1.011-1.204). This head-to-head exploratory study showed that glioma FAP expression volume is an independent risk factor that can significantly influence overall survival in patients with recurrent glioma. Although statistically insignificant, the MTVFAPI:MTVFET ratio, which represents the FAP expression volume percentage of the post-treatment glioma tissue, suggests trends toward significant differentiation between glioma recurrence and treatment-related changes.",Hua T; Huang Q; Zhou Z; Zhou W; Wen J; Xie F; Li M; Guan Y; Zhuang D,"Department of Nuclear Medicine & Positron Emission Tomography Center, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.",EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry,2025-08-26,10.1186/s41181-025-00378-z,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

40855423,Injured renal cell membrane encapsulated ICG/CORM-401 for homologous targeted NIR theranostics of acute kidney injury. ,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequently attributed to the lack of effective early diagnosis and incorrect timing for treatment, resulting in a high incidence rate and mortality. Currently, there is no precise clinical treatment available for AKI. In this study, we developed a good approach utilizing injured renal cell membrane-coated ICG/CORM-401 nanosystem (IRICP), which can specifically target to the injured kidney site through homologous targeting of the injured renal cell membrane. Through in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that indocyanine green (ICG), acting as a near-infrared (NIR) contrast agent, enables clear visualization of its distribution using fluorescence imaging and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) techniques. The addition of CORM-401 effectively mitigates AKI-induced oxidative stress by consuming reactive oxygen species and generating carbon monoxide for anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-oxidative effects, thereby effectively inhibiting the progression of AKI and facilitating its recovery. In conclusion, this targeted theranostic strategy presents high efficiency and promise potential for the future clinical treatment of AKI.",Yao S; Wang Y; Shao L; Chen Y; Niu A; He J; Fan W; Xu L; Xu B; Mou X; Yang X; Cai Y,"Center for Rehabilitation Medicine, Rehabilitation & Sports Medicine, Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Affiliated People's Hospital, Research Institute of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 310014, Zhejiang, China.",Journal of nanobiotechnology,2025-08-26,10.1186/s12951-025-03634-1,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40855444,Exploring nursing students' experiences of normal vaginal delivery simulation using immersive virtual reality (IVR): a qualitative research. ,"This study qualitatively explored the feasibility and effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (IVR) simulation as an educational tool to overcome the limitations experienced by nursing students during clinical practice in maternity settings. Many nursing students face restrictions in their practical experiences due to cultural and gender-related barriers in clinical settings, and traditional simulation methods often lack sufficient realism, thus diminishing their educational effectiveness. This study aimed to comprehend nursing students' perceptions and emotional responses regarding their experiences with IVR natural childbirth simulations. We conducted focus group interviews with 30 third-year nursing students and analyzed their IVR simulation experiences using thematic analysis, a qualitative method involving systematic coding and identification of emerging themes. Three main categories emerged from the thematic analysis as follows: (1) advantages of IVR simulations (four sub-categories: proactive participation, integration of theory and practice, enhanced communication and problem-solving, and learner-centered repetition); (2) unique aspects of IVR learning experiences (two sub-categories: realism and immersion and comprehensive visualization); and (3) areas for improvement in IVR practice (three sub-categories: diverse scenarios, comprehensive evaluations, and enhanced realism through detailed controls). However, the students suggested improvements such as incorporating more diverse scenarios and variables, providing comprehensive evaluation reports for each stage, and enhancing realism through detailed controls. This study suggests that IVR simulation has significant potential as an innovative educational tool to effectively overcome clinical limitations and enhance nursing students' readiness for clinical practice.",Jeong S; Lim SI,"Department of Nursing, College of Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan City, Republic of Korea.",BMC nursing,2025-08-25,10.1186/s12912-025-03675-9,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

This study aims to develop a simple, efficient strategy for rapidly isolating Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative), Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), and Candida albicans (yeast) directly from blood while preserving whole-cell integrity for downstream applications like fluorescence staining. The method employs antibody-conjugated magnetic beads to capture pathogens directly from blood, enhancing detection sensitivity for low-abundance organisms. Pathogens are eluted as intact cells, enabling visualization via fluorescence staining. The approach successfully isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans, demonstrating robust performance and clinical potential.

40855085,Novel in situ seeding immunodetection assay uncovers neuronal-driven alpha-synuclein seeding in Parkinson's disease. ,"Aggregates of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) propagate through template-induced misfolding in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). Prion-like seeding is crucial in disease initiation and progression, representing a major target for disease-modifying therapies. The detection of α-syn seeding with seeding amplification assays (SAAs) has remarkable diagnostic and research potential. However, current SAAs rely on bulk tissue homogenates or fluids, losing critical spatial and cellular resolution. Here, we report our novel in situ seeding immunodetection (isSID) assay that enables the visualization of seeding with unprecedented morphological detail in intact biological tissue. Using the isSID assay, we confirm seeding activity in α-syn aggregates in PD, MSA, and other proteinopathies, while uncovering neuron-driven seeding preceding the clinical symptom onset in PD.

40853471,Recognizing an IVC leiomyosarcoma: CT imaging hallmarks and the utility of 3D rendering. ,"Inferior vena cava (IVC) leiomyosarcoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy arising from smooth muscle cells of the IVC wall, accounting for less than 1 in 100,000 adult malignancies. It carries a poor prognosis, with high recurrence rates and 5-year disease-free survival reported as low as 6%. Clinical presentation is often vague, including abdominal or back pain, lower extremity edema, and weight loss, making imaging pivotal for diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is the modality of choice, but diagnosis remains challenging due to overlap with more common pathologies such as renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, adrenal tumors, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. This pictorial review presents a curated series of cases highlighting the spectrum of imaging appearances of IVC leiomyosarcoma. By showcasing both typical and atypical imaging patterns, this review aims to broaden radiologists' diagnostic awareness and improve confidence in identifying this elusive tumor. Special emphasis is placed on 3D CT imaging techniques, including optimal acquisition protocols and post-processing methods, to enhance lesion visualization and vascular mapping.

The safety was evaluated based on reported adverse events (AEs), including serious AEs, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and safety laboratory parameters. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition was performed precontrast and postcontrast to assess the clinical relevance of images in primary breast tumors, liver, and pancreas relative to reference tissue. PK parameters were calculated from a noncompartmental analysis of the plasma Mn concentrations versus time.<h4>Results</h4>There was a total of 29 AEs reported to all participants of the 2 cohorts. The AEs were mostly of mild to moderate severity and possibly or probably related to the contrast agent. No clinically significant changes in the safety laboratory parameters were reported, except for transiently elevated transaminases observed at the end of the infusion. Clinically relevant low-background MRI scans for clinical visualization of primary breast tumor, liver, and pancreas were obtained at the expanded dose level.

40857768,Translaminar contralateral endoscopic foraminotomy for foraminal stenosis and lumbar disc herniation at L5-S1. ,"L5-S1 pathologies including foraminal disc herniation, foraminal stenosis and spondylolisthesis are well-recognized causes of radicular pain, functional limitation, and diminished quality of life, with many patients requiring surgical intervention due to refractory symptoms or progressive neurological compromise [1,2]. Traditionally, surgical decompression at L5-S1 has involved interbody fusion procedures, aimed at restoring foraminal height and stabilizing the segment to relieve nerve root impingement [3]. However, these procedures can result in prolonged recovery times, increased surgical morbidity, and the long-term risk of adjacent segment degeneration [4,5]. In recent years, endoscopic techniques have emerged as minimally invasive, motion-preserving alternatives for patients with radiculopathy due to foraminal compression [5,6]. Among these, the translaminar contralateral endoscopic foraminotomy (TCEF) approach allows for direct visualisation and precise neural decompression of the L5 nerve root without compromising segmental stability, offering faster recovery, less postoperative pain, and significant reduction in hospital stay [7-9]. The authors report a video technical note on a TCEF in a 39-year-old male with four years of worsening L5 radiculopathy and low back pain. MRI demonstrated a bilateral pars defect with low-grade spondylolisthesis, severe foraminal stenosis and annular bulging (Fig. 1). Under general anaesthesia, fluoroscopic guidance confirmed the L5-S1 level and contralateral translaminar entry point, and a 10-mm incision was made just lateral to the midline. A dilator was advanced to the L5 lamina (Fig. 2A), followed by placement of a 10-mm working cannula (Fig. 3A and B) and stenosis scope. A small laminotomy under the L5 spinous process and lamina was performed, creating a wider working corridor within the canal and providing access to the epidural space and contralateral L5-S1 foramen (Fig. 2B, C and 3C). A 30° endoscope provided high-definition magnified visualization, facilitating precise discectomy and decompression of the L5 nerve root using endoscopic graspers, rongeurs, and radiofrequency probes (Fig. 3E-G). The incision was closed with a single subcutaneous suture and the procedure was completed in 53 min with estimated blood loss of <1 cc. Postoperative imaging confirmed adequate decompression and preservation of the facet joint. Early clinical outcomes demonstrated the patient had resolution of radicular symptoms and no neurological complications. Across three performed cases, the TCEF technique was associated with rapid recovery, less than 24-h length of stay (two of three patients discharged the same day), and preservation of spinal stability. This highlights the advantages of TCEF as a non-fusion alterative for L5-S1 foraminal decompression as it provides enhanced visualization of the foraminal corridor, enables precise discectomy and minimises the risk of iatrogenic instability [7,11,12]. Furthermore, its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of herniation morphologies at the L5-S1 level [1,9,10].",Mobbs RJ; Lin JL; Huang C; Parkinson R; Ma A,"Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2033, Australia; NeuroSpine Surgery Research Group (NSURG), Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia; NeuroSpine Clinic, Prince of Wales Private Hospital, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia.",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2025-08-25,10.1016/j.jocn.2025.111566,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40857818,Synthesizing whole-body CT images from Dixon MR images using tissue composition prior knowledge and a parametric physical model. ,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has replaced computed tomography (CT) in various medical applications since the excellent tissue contrast of the MR images enables the clear visualization of soft tissues and lesions. However, clinically essential physical tissue parameters that were originally derived from CT images for medical physics applications cannot be obtained from MR images due to the lack of fundamental relationships between MR signals and the parameters. This study proposed a novel method for synthesizing CT images from Dixon MR images. The proposed method segmented human tissues into three classes with corresponding compositional sub-tissue pairs. Composition maps were calculated using the standard composition of the sub-tissues with the volume fractions of water and fat obtained from Dixon images. A parametric physical model was applied to synthesize CT images with the composition maps and spectrum characteristic parameters of a reference CT scanner. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using whole-body CT and Dixon images and compared with two generative adversarial networks (GANs). Results indicated that the proposed method accurately synthesized CT images from Dixon images with performance superior to the GANs. Compared with the GANs, on average, the proposed method lowered the absolute Hounsfield unit difference by 22, elevated the peak signal-to-noise ratio by 4.6 dB, and increased the structural similarity by 4 %.

Each of the cases presented is unique in presentation and treatment. The use of POCUS has opened a door to the possibility of adopting prehospital guidelines for the management of PREM in prehospital cardiac arrest and subsequently more tailored treatment of patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Use of portable ultrasound in prehospital cardiac arrest highlights a large gap in our understanding and treatment of PREM. While these patients all ultimately died, their cases highlight the opportunity for more appropriate care, both prehospital and in-hospital. Because literature has posited that PEA is a more complex cardiac rhythm than previously thought, we are suggesting that pre-hospital cardiac arrest care guidelines reflect our current body of understanding. These cases emphasize the importance of emergency medical service (EMS) POCUS use and supports a transition to hands-free, or ultrasound-guided, pulse checks during cardiac arrest.
