41024091,Simple but complex: aged care healthcare professionals' perspectives on the design of a digital falls dashboard.,"<h4>Background</h4>Digital dashboards are widely employed across healthcare settings to present data, supporting timely risk identification and enhancing clinical decision-making. Incorporating feedback from end-users into dashboard design supports their uptake and utilisation. The current study aimed to: (a) understand how healthcare professionals working in residential aged care gather, interpret, transfer and communicate clinical information especially for falls management; and (b) utilise co-design methods to determine healthcare professionals' preferences for presentation, content and functionality of a digital falls dashboard to support delivery of care in residential aged care.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants were recruited via aged care provider and primary health network contacts. Individual interviews with general practitioners (GPs) (n = 3) explored end-user needs including information needs for falls management, decision-making processes, and dashboard preferences. Dashboard prototypes were developed using the interview findings and published guidelines. Prototypes were then presented for feedback in eight workshops (n = 20 participants; residential aged care staff, GPs, and geriatricians) completed via videoconferencing or in-person to gain feedback. Interview and workshop transcripts were analysed using template analysis.<h4>Results</h4>During interviews, GPs discussed difficulties in accessing aged care resident information, clinical decision-making in residential aged care, and use of decision support. During workshops, healthcare professionals shared feedback on the design, content, and functionality of dashboard prototypes. Healthcare professionals also discussed themes of human-technology interaction. This included mistrust of new digital tools and barriers to their use in residential aged care. The current study found that healthcare professionals want a dashboard that displays relevant resident data, such as medications, includes features for benchmarking, and provides detailed insights to support decision making. They expressed a need for evidence-based decision support but advocated for minimal alerts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Healthcare professionals were receptive to using a dashboard in residential aged care to minimise resident falls. They shared their design ideas in co-design interviews and workshops for a prospective dashboard.

41038377,"Rehabilitation, neuroplasticity, and machine learning: Approaching artificial intelligence for equitable health systems.","Recently, technology has evolved significantly in the rehabilitation process for neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, as a fundamental base of brain rehabilitation, is the change in the output of neural circuits in response to the stimulus of the input activity. The physiological and anatomical changes that occur following a brain insult compel the brain to rewire for the sake of reacquiring lost functions or behaviors in a driven form of neural plasticity called neurorehabilitation. One of the main challenges in neuroscience research is the accurate visualization of the brain structure and brain connectivity related to behaviors and memory. Building machine learning predictive models for brain disorders associated with neural circuits and brain plasticity defects is a promising early detection tool for some mental health disorders. Machine learning is becoming more impactful in neuroimaging because it can discern intricate patterns in multidimensional and multimodal data. This technology may then be utilized to generate data-driven classifications and predictions for specific patients. In this review, we discuss main ideologies of neuroplasticity concepts as well as the concept of neuroplasticity induction and neural circuit defects associated with neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to discussing some applications of artificial intelligence of machine learning (ML) models for the future vision of early mental health detection in low- and middle-income countries.

41027031,Innovative Integration of 4D Cardiovascular Reconstruction and Hologram: Framework Development of a New Visualization Tool for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Planning.,"<h4>Background</h4>Planning for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) necessitates advanced spatial visualization skills and consideration of multiple factors, including the depth of coronary arteries within the subepicardium, calcification levels, and pericardial adhesions.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to address these requirements by reconstructing a dynamic cardiovascular model, displaying it as a naked-eye hologram, and evaluating the clinical utility of this innovative visualization tool for preoperative CABG planning.<h4>Methods</h4>We used preoperative 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography (4D-CCTA) data from 14 patients scheduled for CABG to develop a semiautomated workflow. This workflow enabled time-resolved segmentation of the heart chambers, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and coronary arteries, complete with calcium scoring. Methods for segmenting cardiac structures, quantifying coronary calcification, visualizing coronary depth within EAT, and assessing pericardial adhesions via motion analysis were incorporated. These dynamic reconstructions captured spatial relationships, coronary stenosis, calcification, and depth in EAT, as well as pericardial adhesions. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were then generated and displayed using the Looking Glass platform (Looking Glass Factory Inc). Thirteen cardiac surgeons assessed the utility of the holographic visualization tool on a Likert scale. In addition, a surgeon visually scored pericardial adhesions using the holograms of all 21 patients (including 7 undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) and compared these scores with actual intraoperative findings.<h4>Results</h4>Cardiac surgeons highly rated the visualization tool for its utility in preoperative planning, with a mean Likert score of 4.57/5.0 (SD 0.5). The hologram-based scoring of pericardial adhesions showed a strong correlation with intraoperative findings (correlation coefficient r=0.786; P<.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study delineates the structural framework of a visualization tool specifically designed for preoperative CABG planning.

41034781,Radiomics analysis using machine learning to predict perineural invasion in pancreatic cancer.,"<h4>Background</h4>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies of the digestive system and is characterized by an extremely low five-year survival rate. The perineural invasion (PNI) status in patients with pancreatic cancer is positively correlated with adverse prognoses, including overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Emerging radiomic methods can reveal subtle variations in tumor structure by analyzing preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) imaging data. Therefore, we propose the development of a preoperative CECT-based radiomic model to predict the risk of PNI in patients with pancreatic cancer.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This study enrolled patients with pancreatic malignancies who underwent radical resection. Computerized tools were employed to extract radiomic features from tumor regions of interest (ROIs). The optimal radiomic features associated with PNI were selected to construct a radiomic score (RadScore). The model's reliability was comprehensively evaluated by integrating clinical and follow-up information, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based visualization to interpret the decision-making processes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 167 patients with pancreatic malignancies were included. From the CECT images, 851 radiomic features were extracted, 22 of which were identified as most strongly correlated with PNI. These 22 features were evaluated using seven machine learning methods. We ultimately selected the Gaussian naive Bayes model, which demonstrated robust predictive performance in both the training and validation cohorts, and achieved area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.899 and 0.813, respectively. Among the clinical features, maximum tumor diameter, CA-199 level, blood glucose concentration, and lymph node metastasis were found to be independent risk factors for PNI. The integrated model yielded AUCs of 0.945 (training cohort) and 0.881 (validation cohort). Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the ensemble model to predict perineural invasion.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The combined model integrating clinical and radiomic features exhibited excellent performance in predicting the probability of perineural invasion in patients with pancreatic cancer.

41039687,AI-Driven CBCT Analysis for Surgical Decision-Making and Mucosal Damage Prediction in Sinus Lift Surgery for patients with low RBH.,"<h4>Background</h4>Decision-making for maxillary sinus floor elevation (MSFE) surgery in patients with low residual bone height (<4 mm) presents significant challenges, particularly in selecting surgical approaches and predicting intraoperative mucosal perforation. Traditional methods rely heavily on physician experience, lack standardization and objectivity, and often fail to meet the demands of precision medicine. This study aims to build an intelligent decision-making system based on deep learning to optimize surgical selection and predict the risk of mucosal perforation, providing clinicians with a reliable auxiliary tool.<h4>Methods</h4>This study retrospectively analysed the cone-beam computed tomography imaging data of 79 patients who underwent MSFE and constructed a three-dimensional (3D) deep-learning model based on the overall CT data of the patients for surgical procedure selection and prediction of mucosal perforation. The model innovatively introduced the Convolutional Block Attention Module mechanism and depthwise separable convolution technology to enhance the model's ability to capture spatial features and computational efficiency. The model was rigorously trained and validated on multiple datasets, with visualization achieved through attention heatmaps to improve interpretability.<h4>Results</h4>The modified EfficientNet model achieved an F1 score of 0.6 in the procedure decision task of MSFE. For predicting mucosal perforation, the improved ResNet model achieved an accuracy of 0.8485 and an F1-score of 0.7273 on the mixed dataset. In the experimental group, the improved ResNet model achieved an accuracy of 0.8235, a recall of 0.7619, and an F1-score of 0.7302. In the control group, the model also maintained stable performance, with an F1-score of 0.6483. Overall, the 3D convolutional model enhanced the accuracy and stability of mucosal perforation prediction by leveraging the spatial features of cone-beam computed tomography imaging, demonstrating a certain degree of generalization capability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study is the first to construct a deep learning-based 3D intelligent decision-making model for MSFE. These findings confirm the model's effectiveness in surgical decision-making and in predicting the risk of mucosal perforation.

In environmental health, SEMs are systematically used to categorize evidence on topics such as pollution control measures, climate change impacts, and health disparities. The methodological framework for conducting SEMs involves defining the research scope, employing a systematic search strategy, screening studies systematically, optionally conducting critical appraisal (risk of bias assessment) when studies are categorized by effect direction or intended to inform subsequent syntheses, and coding data for synthesis and visualization. Narrative synthesis, heatmaps and network diagrams enhance SEMs usability. However, challenges remain, including methodological inconsistencies and the need for standardization. Advances in automation, machine learning, and stakeholder engagement can further refine SEMs methodologies. This commentary situates SEMs within the broader family of evidence synthesis, emphasizing their role in environmental health science. By enhancing methodological clarity and leveraging innovative tools, SEMs can support researchers and decision-makers in navigating complex evidence ecosystems and implementing evidence-based solutions for environmental scientists.",Khalil H; Welsh V; Grainger M; Campbell F,"School of Psychology and Public Health, Department of Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.

41028301,Reconstruction of three-dimensional retinal shape from refractive topography data.,"A three-dimensional retinal shape was reconstructed by refractive topography (RT).<h4>Methods</h4>The personalized optical models of the human eye were reconstructed based on geometric parameters from clinical measurements. The expected refraction distribution on the fundus was calculated for each model. Subsequently, the refraction-position conversion function (RPF) was derived by fitting the data sets, which included the field of view (FOV), vitreous thickness (VT), and refraction. Additionally, the coordinates on the fundus of the human eye were calculated from RT data through the RPF. Ultimately, a three-dimensional retinal shape was reconstructed.<h4>Results</h4>The expected refraction was calculated on 6 subjects. The results demonstrate that the expected refraction decreased as the VT increased. However, when the FOV was greater than 8°, the expected refraction increased with increasing FOV. A polynomial was applied to fit the 656 data points, resulting in the formation of the RPF. The fitting results demonstrated that the relationship tended to be similar in general for different human eyes, but there were individual differences. This reconstructed method provided good agreement between the reconstructed three-dimensional retina shape and the OCT measurements.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The reconstructed three-dimensional retinal shape from RT data enables new imaging protocols that improve visualization of retinal shape.",Ma Z; Fang L; Ma C; Liu Y; Guo Z; Wang Y,"Key Laboratory for Optoelectronic Information Perception and Instrumentation of Jiangxi Province, Nanchang Hangkong University, Nanchang, 330063, China.",Scientific reports,2025-09-30,10.1038/s41598-025-98650-4,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
41042457,"Robotic adrenalectomy: a comprehensive review of perioperative outcomes, comparative efficacy, and technological advancements.","The adrenal glands are small but vital endocrine organs responsible for hormone production, which is essential for stress response, fluid balance, and blood pressure regulation. Adrenalectomy, the surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands, is indicated in various benign and malignant conditions such as pheochromocytomas, aldosterone-producing adenomas, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Historically performed via open surgery, adrenalectomy has evolved significantly with the introduction of laparoscopic adrenalectomy in the 1990s and more recently, robotic adrenalectomy. Robotic adrenalectomy enhances surgical precision through 3D visualization, articulated instruments, and improved ergonomics, thereby addressing the limitations inherent to laparoscopic adrenalectomy. This narrative review synthesises the findings from pivotal studies that compare the perioperative outcomes of robotic adrenalectomy and laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Robotic adrenalectomy demonstrates favourable outcomes in terms of operative precision, reduced estimated blood loss, and comparable or shorter hospital stay, especially in complex scenarios involving obesity, large tumours, or altered anatomy. Complication rates remain low, and R0 resection rates exceed 95% in well-selected malignancies, supporting the oncological adequacy of robotic adrenalectomies. While robotic adrenalectomy offers superior surgeon ergonomics and a relatively short learning curve, its high initial costs and lack of tactile feedback present notable limitations. Technological advancements, including high-definition 3D optics, fluorescence imaging, and artificial intelligence integration, have further refined the potential of robotic adrenalectomies. However, the evidence remains largely retrospective, with limited prospective randomised trials evaluating long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Robotic adrenalectomy appears to be particularly advantageous in complex adrenal cases, offering a safe, minimally invasive option with the potential for improved recovery and surgical outcomes. Future research should focus on the long-term oncologic efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and economic sustainability of robotic adrenalectomy in diverse clinical settings. Robotic adrenalectomy represents a significant milestone in adrenal surgery, with growing evidence supporting its selective use as a preferred approach in experienced centres and in appropriately chosen patients.",Coco D; Leanza S,"Department of General, Robotic, Oncologic Surgery, Giglio Hospital Foundation, Cefalù, Italy. webcostruction@msn.com.",Journal of robotic surgery,2025-10-03,10.1007/s11701-025-02843-y,3.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract),Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy; Endocrine Surgery; Perioperative Outcomes; Robotic Adrenalectomy
41041623,Automated phenotyping of congenital heart disease for dynamic patient aggregation and outcome reporting.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Accurate characterization of patients with congenital heart disease is fundamental to research, outcomes reporting, quality improvement, and clinical decision-making. Here we present an approach to computing the anatomy of patients with congenital heart disease based on the whole of their diagnostic and surgical codes.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>All diagnostic and procedure codes for patients cared for between 1981 and 2020 at Boston Children's Hospital were extracted from a database containing diagnostic codes from echocardiograms, and procedural codes from surgical and catheterization procedures. The pipeline sequentially (1) mapped each of the 7500 native codes to algorithm codes; (2) computed the parent anatomy for each study using a pre-defined hierarchy; (3) computed the parent anatomy for the patient, based on highest ranking parent anatomy; and (4) computed the subcategories and mandatory co-variate findings for each patient. Thereafter, diagnostic accuracy of 500 unseen patients was adjudicated against clinical documentation by clinical experts.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 514 541 echocardiograms on 161 735 patients were available for this study. Phenotypes of congenital cardiac diseases were assigned in 84 285 patients (52%), and the remainder were computed to have normal anatomy. Clinicians agreed with algorithm assignments in 96.4% (482 of 500 patients), with disagreements most often representing definitional differences. An interactive dashboard enabled by the output of this algorithm is presented.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The computation of detailed congenital heart defect phenotypes from raw diagnostic and procedure codes is possible with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency.

41023909,"In search of pragmatic measures and models from routinely collected electronic records to inform continuous optimization of antibiotics stewardship at primary care settings: preliminary findings from Anhui, China.","<h4>Background</h4>Antimicrobial resistance caused by inappropriate antibiotic use has become a global public health crisis. The majority of antibiotics are prescribed at primary care settings which often lack sufficient capacity and surveillance. This study aimed at identifying and testing pragmatic measures and models derived from routinely collected electronic records of primary care encounters to inform continuous antibiotics stewardship.<h4>Methods</h4>We first extracted a total of 7.097 million records of primary care visits over 25 months from Anhui, China, through stratified random cluster sampling and a minimum set of data about related communities. We then identified pragmatic measures and models for examining antibiotic prescribing at primary care settings through repeated cycles of measure/model identification and relevance analysis. The 'identification' used multidisciplinary group meetings while the analysis adopted hybrid methodologies, including descriptive analysis, random forest classification modeling, and data visualization.<h4>Results</h4>The study revealed that: (a) antibiotic prescribing rates ranged from 36.82 to 86.25% for the 7 categories of diagnoses studied, including respiratory diseases (RD), digestive diseases (DD), urogenital diseases (UD), skin infections (SI), injuries (IJ), eye infections (EI), and oral and dental diseases (OD); (b) although overall antibiotic prescribing decreased from 67.80 to 47.11% over the study period, the proportion of broad-spectrum added up to 78.96%; (c) the top 10% and 20% clinicians prescribed 59.9% and 80.0% of all the antibiotic prescriptions; (d) 50.8% of the antibiotic recipients received 2 or more antibiotic prescriptions within the 25-months; (e) the AUC of models of antibiotic prescribing ranged from 0.92 to 0.97 for the 7-category- diagnoses, in which the patient, clinician and spatiotemporal variables contributed 0.08 ~ 0.27, 0.30 ~ 0.70 and 0.16 ~ 0.62 respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The measures and models derived out of routinely collected electronic records of primary healthcare encounters in this study are both feasible and useful.",Xiao D; Yang X; Zheng Y; Xu J; Yang N; Li Y; Wang Y; Cui R; Li N; Liu R; Lu M; Wang D; Shen X,"School of Health Service Management, Anhui Medical University, Hefei Anhui, 230032, China.",BMC infectious diseases,2025-09-29,10.1186/s12879-025-11646-3,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),China; Primary Care; Electronic Records; Antibiotic Prescribing; Antibiotics Stewardship
41037765,Interactive Use of Cox Model-Predicted Survival Curves: An Application Using ACS10 Score and Age to Personalize Treatment of Pediatric AML.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Analyses in oncology frequently include Cox proportional hazards models for survival outcomes, but reported results typically only include hazard ratios and respective inference. Cox model predictions of survival functions may help to provide a greater clinical meaning from fitted Cox models for precision oncology research.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We created a publicly available software library, shinyCox, that can generate user-friendly interactive applications to visualize survival outcome predictions of fitted Cox models. To illustrate the benefits of this software, we analyzed data from AML02 and AML08, randomized clinical trials for pediatric patients with AML. Building on a recent article, we assessed how baseline factors and a pharmacogenomics score (ACS10) can affect the predicted overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) between patients assigned to induction regimens of clofarabine plus cytarabine or daunorubicin and etoposide combined with low-dose cytarabine or high-dose cytarabine.<h4>Results</h4>Our model outcome prediction visualization application highlights previously reported associations of ACS10 with EFS and OS, while also providing a better understanding of how other prognostic factors amplify or mitigate prognostic implications of ACS10. It is informative to better understand the practical clinical outcomes in terms of predicted survival probabilities to complement the insights gained from hazard ratio tables.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using shinyCox, we generated visualization applications that let us identify complex relationships between the ACS10 score, age, and the predicted OS and EFS probabilities after AML therapy. This article shows how shinyCox will facilitate model interpretation and accelerate the development of personalized therapies in oncology.",Selukar S; Clement H; Ni Y; Wu H; Patni T; Seffernick AE; Inaba H; Ribeiro R; Lamba J; Li Y; Pounds S,"Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.",JCO precision oncology,2025-10-02,10.1200/po-25-00634,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41042687,Evaluating the Implementation of Public Health Strategies to Address COVID-19 Disparities in a Community Setting: A Qualitative Study Using the RE-AIM Framework.,"<h4>Background</h4>Health disparities, particularly among racial and ethnic minority populations, were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factors like social determinants of health, vaccine hesitancy, and pre-existing health conditions. Local government leaders within an urban city received federal funds to address these disparities by improving health literacy and engaging in culturally responsive outreach and education among Black and Latinx communities within a mid-sized city in the southeastern United States.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify facilitators and barriers to implementing public health strategies aimed at addressing COVID-19 health disparities in a community guided by the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework.<h4>Design</h4>The research team conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews via telephone, Zoom, or in person between March 20th and April 12th, 2024.<h4>Participants/setting</h4>Fifteen participants, including local governmental health office staff (e.g., nurse navigators, administrative staff) and employees from community center partner sites, were included in the study.<h4>Analysis</h4>Two coders applied both a priori codes guided by the RE-AIM framework and data-driven inductive codes to transcripts in NVivo 14. A final interrater reliability measurement, Cohen's kappa coefficient (k = 0.74), was calculated, indicating a moderate level of agreement between coders. NVivo 14 data visualization tools (e.g., coding matrices) were used to inform thematic content analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Themes were identified within each RE-AIM dimension, highlighting various facilitators and barriers to implementing the selected public health strategies. Working in synergy with community center staff and other community partners to create tailored services and resources was vital for successful implementation. Transparency and timely communication, additional full-time program implementers (i.e., nurse navigators), and sustainable funding sources were identified as key elements to enhance effective implementation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Insights from the local governmental health office and community center staff's experiences in this study highlight recommendations for effective implementation of locally tailored public health strategies to address COVID-19 health disparities in similar community-based settings. Future research should capture the perceptions and experiences of community members to better understand acceptability, accessibility, and utilization in similar initiatives.",McElrone M; Holden E; Brown C; Ballew J,"Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA.","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",2025-10-03,10.1111/phn.70021,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

41044309,Transfer learning-enhanced CNN model for integrative ultrasound and biomarker-based diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease.,"Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD), also known as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), is a prevalent hormonal and metabolic condition primarily affecting women of reproductive age worldwide. It is typically marked by disrupted ovulation, an increase in circulating androgen hormones, and the presence of multiple small ovarian follicles, which collectively result in menstrual irregularities, infertility challenges, and associated metabolic disturbances. This study presents an automated diagnostic framework for PCOD detection from transvaginal ultrasound images, leveraging an Enhanced [Formula: see text] convolutional neural network architecture. The model incorporates attention mechanisms, batch normalization, and dropout regularization to improve feature learning and generalization. Bayesian Optimization was employed to fine-tune critical hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate, ensuring optimal model performance. The proposed system was trained and validated on a curated ovarian ultrasound image dataset, applying data augmentation and SMOTE techniques to address class imbalance. Experimental evaluation demonstrated that the Enhanced [Formula: see text] model achieved a classification accuracy of 94.8%, sensitivity of 93.2%, specificity of 95.5%, precision of 94.0%, and an F1-score of 93.6% on the independent test set. Interpretability was enhanced through Grad-CAM visualization, which effectively localized diagnostically significant regions within the ultrasound images, corroborating clinical findings. These results highlight the potential of the proposed deep learning-based framework to serve as a reliable, scalable, and interpretable decision-support tool for PCOD diagnosis, offering improved diagnostic consistency and reducing operator dependency in clinical workflows.",Sundari MS; Sailaja NV; Swapna D; Vikkurty S; Jadala VC; Durga K; Thottempudi P,"BVRIT HYDERABAD College of Engineering for Women, Computer Science and Engineering, Hyderabad, 500090, India. sundari.m@bvrithyderabad.edu.in.",Scientific reports,2025-10-03,10.1038/s41598-025-17711-w,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),[Formula: See Text]; Polycystic Ovarian Disease (Pcod); Ultrasound Image Classification; Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization; Deep Learning In Medical Imaging
41028953,Laser Ultrasound Super-Resolution Imaging for Multi-Parametric Non-Invasive Volumetric Characterization of Brain Cancer.,"Accurate characterization of brain tumor heterogeneities and microvascular dynamics remains an unmet need in cancer research driving the development of innovative imaging methods. Here, laser ultrasound super-resolution imaging (LUSSI) is introduced, a hybrid modality combining laser-generated ultrasound with optoacoustic (OA) contrast to enable functional volumetric (3D) super-resolution imaging of vascular structures in vivo. The system integrates a laser ultrasound (LUS) emitter and a spherical array transducer to localize microbubble responses in 3D, further enabling concurrent acquisition of multi-spectral (multi-wavelength) OA data. The capabilities of LUSSI to assess tumor heterogeneities are demonstrated in a murine glioblastoma model, including visualization of intra-tumoral vasculature, identification of compressed vessels, and detection of functional abnormalities such as hemorrhages and hypoxic regions. OA imaging further enables resolving oxygenated and deoxygenated forms of hemoglobin, revealing heterogeneous perfusion within the tumor core. LUSSI is further shown to resolve whole-brain vascular networks with ≈35 µm resolution and quantify microvascular blood flow and oxygenation, supporting applications in neuroscience. With its non-invasive, multi-parametric capabilities and proven compatibility with clinical imaging components, LUSSI offers a promising platform for studying vascular pathology, monitoring therapy, and advancing translational imaging strategies.",Nozdriukhin D; Chen Y; Lyu S; Razansky D; Deán-Ben XL,"Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Zürich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, Zurich, 8057, Switzerland.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2025-09-30,10.1002/advs.202502298,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Glioblastoma; Microbubbles; Optoacoustic Imaging; Laser Ultrasound Imaging
41023480,The value of contrast-enhanced MRI in the selection of surgical approaches for recurrent lumbar disc herniation in full-endoscopic surgery.,"To assess the value of contrast-enhanced lumbar MRI in guiding the selection of surgical approaches for recurrent lumbar disc herniation (RLDH) treated with full-endoscopic surgery. Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed from 237 patients with RLDH who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced lumbar MRI. Surgical approaches were selected based on the location and degree of nucleus pulposus extrusion observed on MRI. The disc levels involved were as follows: L2/3 (1 case), L3/4 (11 cases), L4/5 (111 cases), and L5/S1 (114 cases). Surgical duration, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stays, and surgical complications were recorded. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for low back and leg pain. All patients successfully underwent full-endoscopic discectomy. At one month postoperatively and at the final follow-up, VAS and ODI scores showed significant improvement compared to preoperative values (final follow-up vs. preoperative: lower back pain VAS [0.34 ± 0.50 vs. 2.54 ± 1.82], leg pain VAS [0.06 ± 0.29 vs. 5.53 ± 1.65], and ODI [0.51 ± 0.98 vs. 66.08 ± 47.14]). According to the modified MacNab criteria, outcomes were rated as excellent in 195 cases, good in 35, fair in 5, and poor in 2, yielding an excellent-to-good rate of 97.0%. No serious intraoperative, postoperative, or follow-up complications were observed. Contrast-enhanced lumbar MRI provides clear visualization of intraspinal anatomical structures in patients with RLDH, facilitating accurate preoperative determination of decompression boundaries. By assessing the spatial relationship between the reherniated nucleus pulposus and the pedicle, and incorporating iliac crest height and surgical history, the optimal surgical approach can be selected. This enables safe and effective removal of herniated disc material, adequate nerve root decompression, and favorable clinical outcomes.",Xiao Q; Huang L; Chu F; Tang X; Wang W; Li Y,"Neck-shoulder and Lumbocrural Pain Division 1, Sichuan Orthopedic Hospital, Chengdu, 610041, China.",Neurosurgical review,2025-09-30,10.1007/s10143-025-03860-z,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Clinical Outcomes; Contrast-enhanced Mri; Surgical Approaches; Recurrent Lumbar Disc Herniation; Full-endoscopic
41032535,Cardiac Microanatomy Imaging Using Forward-viewing Optical Coherence Tomography Endoscope.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Due to limitations in current imaging technologies detecting subtle cardiac microstructural changes that can lead to sudden cardiac death is a significant clinical challenge. To address this problem, we developed a forward-viewing optical coherence tomography (OCT) endoscope for the detection of relevant cardiac microstructures in the subendocardium, including Purkinje fibers, scar tissue, surviving myocytes, and adipose tissue.<h4>Methods</h4>An endoscopic probe based on the scanning fiber principle was developed for OCT measurements in contact. The probe was evaluated in freshly excised ovine hearts exhibiting chronic myocardial infarction. Relevant regions within the cardiac chamber were measured, and distinctive microstructures were identified, characterized, and subsequently corroborated using Masson's trichrome staining. The volumetric imaging data were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect Purkinje fibers, enabling the reconstruction of their 3D morphology.<h4>Results</h4>We were able to distinguish between healthy myocardium, fibrotic remodeling, and critical elements of the cardiac conduction system. Our findings demonstrate the capability of this technology to provide detailed images of cardiac microstructures in large mammal hearts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A novel application of forward-viewing endoscopic OCT in cardiology is demonstrated by visualizing cardiac microstructures within the subendocardium at depths accessible by optical imaging modalities.<h4>Significance</h4>By enhancing visualization at the cellular level, this method may contribute to a better understanding of cardiac physiology and pathology, potentially extending future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Vasquez DL; Einmuller F; Latka I; Kulkarni K; Pallares-Lupon N; Constantin M; Marchant J; Loyer V; Bloquet S; Hamrani DE; Naulin J; Drexler W; Popp J; Unterhuber A; Andreana M; Walton RD; Schie IW,,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2025-10-01,10.1109/tbme.2025.3616493,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41037063,Evaluating Negative Margins in Foot Amputations for Diabetic Osteomyelitis: How Do We Decide?,"<h4>Background</h4>Amputation level in diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is most determined based on surgeon visualization of macroscopic criteria, leading to subjective variability. Wide variance in methods of bone histological analysis and culture are utilized to determine the presence of residual infection. We therefore conducted a systematic, qualitative review to evaluate the current available data on objective measures to delineate the appropriate level of resection in diabetic toe and forefoot amputations, as well as the accuracy of different methods to assess for persistent infection.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a systematic review of studies from 1990 to 2023 performed on methods to determine margins in toe and forefoot amputations for DFO following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Data were summarized to discuss the study main objectives, methods utilized to determine amputation level, and techniques used to assess margins for persistent deep infection.<h4>Results</h4>568 articles were identified, and 18 articles met the final inclusion criteria after review. All studies used plain radiographs for preoperative assessment. 13 used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of their algorithm to determine general amputation level and 3 used MRI to determine exact depth of resection. 15 studies used microbiological cultures and 13 used histopathological margins intraoperatively to assess margins for deep infection. Of those, 7 studies found that those with positive margins had higher rates of treatment failure.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Overall, majority of studies used combination of plain radiographs of MRI to determine amputation level. Patients who ultimately had positive margins correlated with longer antibiotic duration and higher rates of continued infection, impaired wound healing, reoperation, or readmission. Elucidating the optimal method of evaluating clean surgical margins is critical to lessen the burden on health care systems and improve patient care.<b>Level of Evidence:</b> Level III: Qualitative Review.",Anderson A; Choi S; McLellan M; Hsu A; Noori N,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, Irvine, Orange, California.",Foot & ankle specialist,2025-10-02,10.1177/19386400251364978,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Diabetes; amputation; Systematic review; Osteomyelitis
41039551,The effect of reversed screen orientation versus standard orientation in bedside ultrasound on vascular access skill acquisition: a cadaver study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Ultrasound-guided vascular access (USGVA) is an essential clinical skill, but novice learners often face difficulties in interpreting ultrasound images and achieving spatial alignment during procedures. To address this challenge, we hypothesized that using a reversed screen orientation could facilitate the learning process. Reversed screen orientation refers to an ultrasound image flipped in the transverse plane, producing a top-to-bottom mirror image by activating the ""reverse"" function on the ultrasound (US) device. We assumed that this configuration might help align the visual trajectory of the needle with the user's hand movements, potentially easing spatial perception during the early stages of learning.<h4>Metods</h4>The study was conducted in the Anatomy Laboratory of Ordu University Medical Faculty with 60 final-year medical students with no prior US experience. Participants were randomly divided into two groups (A and B), who performed femoral vein needle punctures on cadavers under US guidance with standard (Group A) and reverse (Group B) screen. Each group used both screen orientations across two attempts. Before the procedure, students received theoretical training. Data collected included demographic information, needle visibility, procedure duration, success rates, and complications. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and significance was set at p < 0.05.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed no significant differences in age or sex distribution between groups. In the first attempt, 83.3% of participants with posterior wall penetration were in Group A (standard screen orientation). Needle visualibity score was higher in Group B (reversed screen orientation). The perceived ease of the procedure showed a significant difference in favor of Group B in the second attempt. Overall, while the success rates and time taken were similar between groups, Group B exhibited improved needle visualization and fewer complications related to posterior wall penetration.<h4>Discussion</h4>The findings indicate that reversed screen orientation may facilitate learning and enhance procedural outcomes in USGVA. This orientation aligns better with the spatial perception of needle movement, potentially improving hand-eye coordination. The study supports the integration of reversed screen techniques in US training to improve skill acquisition and reduce complication rates in vascular access procedures. However, limitations include the study being conducted at a single center and using only one cadaver, which may affect the generalizability of results. Future research should explore long-term effects and further validate these findings in diverse clinical settings.",Köksal A; Aygün A; Çaltekin İ; Tomakin M; Sarıbaş MS; Özkay İ; Tokpinar A; Baş O,"Department of Emergency Medicine, Ordu University Faculty of Medicine, Altınordu/Ordu, 52200, Turkey. ademkoksal@odu.edu.tr.",BMC medical education,2025-10-02,10.1186/s12909-025-07899-w,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Training; Ultrasonography; Cadaver; Education; Vascular Access
41023463,"Robotic versus laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on operative metrics, lymphadenectomy, and postoperative complications.","<h4>Background</h4>Robotic gastrectomy has emerged as a potential advancement over laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer, offering enhanced precision through three-dimensional visualization and articulated instrumentation. However, its clinical superiority remains controversial.<h4>Methods</h4>This review was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database (ID: CRD420251133133). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing robotic gastrectomy (RG) with laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) for gastric adenocarcinoma. Literature searches across six databases identified eligible RCTs until January 2025. The primary outcomes included operative time, postoperative complications, blood loss, and lymph node harvest. The secondary outcomes included recovery parameters and hospital stay. Evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE methodology.<h4>Results</h4>Four RCTs encompassing 919 patients (480 RG, 439 LG) met the inclusion criteria. RG significantly reduced overall postoperative complications (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.93, P = 0.03), shortened hospital stay (MD - 0.88 days, 95% CI - 1.21 to - 0.55, P < 0.00001), and accelerated bowel function recovery (MD - 0.52 days, 95% CI - 1.00 to - 0.05, P = 0.03) and oral intake (MD - 0.52 days, 95% CI - 1.01 to - 0.03, P = 0.04). However, operative time was significantly longer (MD + 16.95 min, 95% CI 10.93-22.98, P < 0.00001). Severe complications, anastomotic leakage, reoperation rates, blood loss, and lymph node yield were comparable between the approaches. GRADE assessment revealed moderate certainty for hospital stay reduction and low-to-very-low certainty for other outcomes due to heterogeneity and methodological limitations of the studies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Across four RCTs conducted in high-volume East Asian centers, robotic gastrectomy demonstrates superior perioperative recovery with reduced overall complications and accelerated rehabilitation compared with laparoscopic surgery, despite longer operative times.

41022753,The association between lung function and sensory impairments among chinese middle-aged and older adults: a longitudinal cohort study from CHARLS.,"This study aims to investigate the association between lung function and various types of sensory impairments (specifically visual and hearing impairments) in the elderly population in the middle-aged and older adults in China. This study utilizes data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from the 2011 and 2015 waves of interviews. Participants aged 45 and older with complete data were included in the study. Lung function was assessed using peak expiratory flow (PEF). Multivariable logistic regression and trend regression models analyzed the cross-sectional relationships between PEF, predicted PEF values, and various sensory impairments (SI) The study also examined the prospective relationship between baseline PEF and sensory impairment deterioration using restricted cubic splines for visualization. Finally, subgroup analyses were performed to validate the results' stability. The cross-sectional analysis, after adjusting for confounders, revealed that higher baseline and predicted PEF values were associated with a lower prevalence of SI. This inverse relationship was consistent across various types of impairments, including visual impairment, distance vision impairment, near vision impairment, and hearing impairment. The trend ORs were as follows: (Baseline PEF: 0.894 [0.846, 0.945], 0.881 [0.839, 0.926], 0.922 [0.878, 0.969], and 0.916 [0.873, 0.961]; Predicted PEF %: 0.829 [0.786, 0.874], 0.755 [0.719, 0.791], 0.872 [0.831, 0.914], and 0.770 [0.735, 0.806]). In the combined analysis of sensory impairment types, including single sensory impairment (SSI) and dual sensory impairment (DSI), higher PEF values were also linked to lower prevalence rates. The trend ORs for baseline PEF were 0.924 [0.862, 0.990] and 0.884 [0.826, 0.945], and for predicted PEF % values, the trend ORs were 0.915[0.853, 0.981] and 0.775 [0.725, 0.829]. During follow-up, baseline PEF was significantly associated with the deterioration of Non-SI to DSI. Specifically, the adjusted OR for Q4 relative to Q1 was 0.609 [0.397, 0.933], with a trend OR of 0.862 [0.751, 0.988]. Changes in PEF and predicted PEF percentage values during follow-up were not significantly associated with worsening SI. Subgroup analyses indicated that the inverse relationship between PEF and sensory impairments was significant across various age groups, genders, smoking statuses, and lung disease backgrounds, though the correlation was weaker in non-smokers and individuals with lung diseases. Higher PEF values are associated with a lower prevalence of various sensory impairments and a reduced risk of worsening these impairments in middle-aged and older adults. This study supports the effective screening of SI, particularly in identifying high-risk individuals who may experience the progression of DSI.",Tang WZ; Sheng TH; Xu HY; Cai QY; Zhou ZJ; Chen XB; Yang YH; Liu TH; Wang Y,"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Jiulongpo People's Hospital, Chongqing, 400050, China.",NPJ primary care respiratory medicine,2025-09-29,10.1038/s41533-025-00446-6,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41039526,Dissection in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century: virtual tables versus traditional methods and their influence on medical students' perception - a systematic review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Virtual dissection tables (VDTs) have emerged as innovative tools in anatomy education, offering interactive, three-dimensional visualization of anatomical structures. However, their performance in conjunction with traditional teaching methods needs to be further analyzed and synthesized. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, student satisfaction and perceived utility of VDTs compared to cadaveric dissection, lectures, and textbook-based learning.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search of literature identified 22 eligible studies involving students in medicine and related healthcare professions. Studies were analyzed in terms of design, cohort characteristics, educational outcomes, and anatomical content coverage. VDTs evaluated included commercial platforms such as Anatomage, Spectra, VH Dissector, and institutional in-house systems.<h4>Results</h4>VDT use was associated with improved academic performance in 86% of studies, with score increases ranging from 8 to 31% over traditional teaching methods. The greatest improvements were observed in musculoskeletal And neuroanatomy modules. Student satisfaction ranged from 64 to 95%, with the majority citing improved spatial understanding, engagement, And repeatability. However, preference for VDT-exclusive learning remained low, reported by only 2.4-30.2% of students. Most participants favored a hybrid approach combining VDTs with cadaver-based instruction. Despite these benefits, limitations included high implementation costs (up to $200,000 USD), limited access due to device scarcity, lack of tactile feedback, and significant variation in assessment methods and anatomical content. Additionally, no study conducted a direct comparison between various VDT platforms, nor between commercial and in-house systems.<h4>Conclusion</h4>VDTs represent a valuable complement to traditional anatomy education, enhancing learning outcomes and student engagement across a range of healthcare disciplines. However, their full potential is best realized when used as part of a multimodal curriculum that retains cadaveric dissection. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes, clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness, and to compare different VDT systems.",Telecan T; Capraș RD; Filip GA; Bonea M; Crivii CB,"Department of Anatomy and Embryology, ""Iuliu Hațieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, 400012, Romania.",BMC medical education,2025-10-02,10.1186/s12909-025-07946-6,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Anatomy; Spectra; Medical education; Undergraduate Students; Anatomage; Virtual Dissection Tables
41031807,Feasibility of Spinal Facet Joint Injections With Augmented Reality Headset: A Cadaveric Study.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) offer 3-dimensional (3D) visualization to enhance procedural accuracy and reduce fluoroscopy use in spinal interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of an AR-HMD navigation system for facet joint injections in comparison with the conventional C-arm-guided approach.<h4>Methods</h4>In this prospective controlled study, 5 cadavers underwent computed tomography to generate 3D spine models. An AR application developed in Unity with Vuforia Engine was deployed on the HoloLens 2 headset for navigation. A neurosurgeon performed 216 facet joint needle placements (108 AR-assisted, 108 C-arm-guided). Postprocedural computed tomography validated placement accuracy. An independent blinded radiologist evaluated all placements.<h4>Results</h4>Of 216 total needle placements, 74 (34.3%) were rated excellent, 109 (50.5%) acceptable, and 33 (15.3%) failed. No significant difference in overall success rates was found between AR-guided and C-arm-guided approaches, χ2(2, 216) = 2.96, P = .23. However, lumbar region placements showed significantly higher success in the AR group compared with the control group, χ2(2, 120) = 7.09, P = .03.<h4>Conclusion</h4>AR-guided facet joint needle placement demonstrates accuracy and safety comparable to conventional C-arm-guided techniques. The AR-HMD system enhances 3D anatomic visualization and may reduce radiation exposure for healthcare personnel.

41016954,"Robotic inguinal and umbilical hernia repair: clinical outcomes, costs, and future perspectives: a narrative review.","Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) has rapidly expanded into abdominal wall procedures, including inguinal and umbilical hernia repair. It offers improved ergonomics, three-dimensional visualization, and enhanced dexterity. However, its role in routine hernia surgery remains debatable, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness and patient outcomes. A narrative review of recently published systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized trials, and economic evaluations (2020-2025) was conducted. Evidence was synthesized to compare the clinical outcomes, perioperative metrics, and costs of the robotic, laparoscopic, and open techniques. RAS is associated with higher procedural costs, adding approximately USD 3000-5000 per inguinal hernia repair compared to laparoscopy, and total costs of USD 8000-12,000 for umbilical hernia repair. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios often exceed commonly accepted thresholds in current healthcare settings. Clinical outcomes reveal modest advantages, such as small reductions in early postoperative pain and a slightly earlier return to work, while complication and recurrence rates remain comparable to those of laparoscopy. Prolonged operative times, particularly during the learning curve, further increase the perioperative costs. Cost savings appear achievable only in high-volume centers with optimized team training. RAS represents a technological advance in hernia surgery, supported by structured educational programs and emerging innovations such as AI and augmented reality. In routine uncomplicated hernias, current evidence suggests only limited incremental benefits relative to the additional costs. Caution and selective adoption in anatomically complex or recurrent cases have been proposed, but require further validation through high-quality studies. Ongoing research, technological refinement, and reduction of system costs may progressively enhance the role of robotics in abdominal wall surgery.",Schiano di Visconte M,"Department of General Surgery, Azienda ULSS2 ""Marca Trevigiana"", Via Sant'Ambrogio in Fiera, 37, 31100, Treviso, Italy. mschianodivisconte@gmail.com.",Journal of robotic surgery,2025-09-29,10.1007/s11701-025-02841-0,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),laparoscopy; Health Economics; Cost-effectiveness; Surgical Training; Inguinal Hernia Repair; Robotic Surgery; Umbilical Hernia Repair
41038247,Feasibility and safety of unilateral biportal endoscopic dorsal lumbosacral decompression in dogs: a cadaveric study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the feasibility and safety of unilateral biportal endoscopic dorsal lumbosacral decompression in dogs.<h4>Methods</h4>13 canine cadavers were acquired. Three dogs were used in a pilot study to refine the technique. The remaining 10 were randomly assigned to left- or right-sided procedures. The main study was conducted from November 27 to November 30, 2024, following a pilot study performed 1 month earlier. Preoperative CT aided anatomical assessment and planning. Portal sites were based on the medial pedicle line, connecting the medial borders of the seventh lumbar vertebra and first sacral vertebra pedicles, as identified on dorsoventral radiographs. Unilateral biportal endoscopic dorsal lumbosacral decompression, including dorsal laminectomy, discectomy, and nerve root exploration, was performed. Portal sites, procedural times, and intraoperative complications were recorded. Postoperative CT assessed decompression and facet preservation. A 4-point scoring system (Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor) was used to evaluate visualization and facet joint preservation.<h4>Results</h4>All 10 cadavers were Beagles. All procedures were completed successfully through planned portals. Mean surgery time was 56.3 ± 11.4 minutes. Visualization and facet joint preservation were all rated Excellent. Laminectomy and nerve root exploration times were longer ipsilaterally (17.4 ± 7.2 minutes) than contralaterally (9.6 ± 4.2 minutes), with a mean difference of 7.8 minutes. The mean laminectomy area was significantly larger ipsilaterally (17.6 ± 6.7 mm2) versus contralaterally (10.5 ± 7.3 mm2), with a mean difference of 7.1 mm2. No intraoperative complications occurred.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Unilateral biportal endoscopic dorsal lumbosacral decompression was feasible, safe, and provided excellent visualization in canine cadavers.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Unilateral biportal endoscopic dorsal lumbosacral decompression may represent a viable minimally invasive technique for degenerative lumbosacral stenosis in dogs and warrants further clinical investigation.",Lee B; Lee H; Jeong J; Choi H; Kim D; Jeon Y,"Department of Veterinary Surgery, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.",American journal of veterinary research,2025-10-01,10.2460/ajvr.25.07.0244,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cauda Equina Syndrome; Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery; Degenerative Lumbosacral Stenosis; Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic Spine Surgery; Dorsal Lumbosacral Decompression
41036585,An integrated continuous-flow microfluidic sensor for long-term monitoring of microalgae growth in a tubular photobioreactor.,"<i>Spirulina</i> (<i>Arthrospira platensis</i>) is a valuable cyanobacterium used for various applications, including health supplements, cosmetics, biofertilizers, carbon capture, and biofuels. Efficient monitoring of microalgae growth in photobioreactors is crucial for optimizing yields in large-scale culturing. Existing monitoring systems take samples from the bioreactor at different intervals and perform the visualization and quantification of algae growth parameters. In this work, a microfluidic platform is mounted on a tubular photobioreactor, and the system continuously monitors the growth behavior of <i>Spirulina</i> over several days, with algal development captured on demand. Furthermore, the microfluidic sensor is fabricated using a novel xurography-based approach on photopolymer sheets. It captures real-time micrographs of algae continuously for 5 days (over 120 hours) under two different conditions: open-loop and closed-loop. In the open-loop configuration, the sensor hydrostatically taps the algal medium from the bioreactor at regular intervals. In contrast, the closed-loop sensor continuously (24/7) circulates the culture medium through the microchip for visualization without the use of any driving mechanism. From the micrographs, algal cell density, cell count, and trichome length are estimated continuously, and all parameters exhibited an increasing trend over time. Importantly, the cell density obtained from the microfluidic sensor closely matches with the conventional benchmark glass slide method, with an error of less than 3.3%. The microfluidic monitoring platform is found to be low-cost, accurate, fast, and efficient compared to existing systems, and moreover, it is easily amenable to automation.",Rahul R; Prasad N; Mini RS; Ranjith SK,"APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, Thiruvananthapuram, 695016, Kerala, India.",Lab on a chip,2025-10-02,10.1039/d5lc00546a,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41038363,Optimizing MPRAGE for enhanced blood suppression and intraplaque hemorrhage detection in carotid artery imaging.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aims to optimize the Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) technique to improve the accuracy of intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) detection in carotid diseases and enhance reliability for clinical use, addressing the challenge of inconsistent blood suppression observed in commonly used clinical protocols.<h4>Methods</h4>Bloch equation simulations were used to evaluate the effects of inversion time and flip angle on blood suppression and tissue contrast. The optimized parameters were implemented on a clinical 3 T scanner and tested in four subjects. Quantitative measures included blood-muscle contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) for lumen-wall and lumen-IPH. Imaging was performed in 21 patients with carotid artery disease, two MPRAGE acquisitions were performed per patient: (1) at the magnet isocenter with the standard IR pulse, and (2) at a 50-mm shifted position toward the heart with the wideband IR pulse. Qualitative image quality was evaluated independently by two neuroradiologists using a predefined 4-point scale (1 = poor, 4 = excellent) for blood suppression, vessel wall clarity, motion artifacts, and IPH visualization, in addition to quantitative SNR and CNR measurements.<h4>Results</h4>The optimized MPRAGE sequence demonstrated significantly improved blood suppression, with blood-muscle contrast increasing from 0.42 ± 0.08 to 0.61 ± 0.07 (p = 0.002). Lumen-wall CNR increased from 15.2 ± 3.4 to 22.8 ± 4.1 (p = 0.01), and lumen-IPH CNR increased from 18.7 ± 5.2 to 26.3 ± 6.0 (p = 0.004). These improvements enhanced vessel wall delineation and IPH conspicuity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Optimization of MPRAGE parameters enhances blood suppression and contrast, providing improved visualization of the carotid vessel wall and more reliable detection of IPH.

41037038,Development and Implementation of the Modified Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale in Two Large Academic Pediatric Centers.,"Emergency department crowding is a chronic problem within health care systems. The consequences of crowding are well documented with negative impacts on patient outcomes, patient/family satisfaction, staff stress, and medical errors. This study describes the implementation of the Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale in 2 emergency departments, a 45-bed and a 22-bed, within a large pediatric academic medical center. Initial work revealed the scale worked well at a 45-bed emergency department but significantly underreported crowding at the 22-bed emergency department. A bed capacity correction factor was developed and incorporated in the Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale formula, thus standardizing the view of crowding in each emergency department. The modified Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale provided real-time visualization of crowding in both emergency departments and health care system capacity management systems. The modified Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale was shared with a pediatric emergency department within another large academic pediatric medical center. Implementation of the bed capacity correction factor into their system resulted in a similarly improved demonstration of emergency department crowding through the Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale.",Timm N; Kemp L; Kerrey B; Elam M; Overmann KM; Lillich C; Thorne A; Collins J; Siska M; Ponti-Zins M; Duma E; Revet J; Snell S; Ajiboye A; Imler D,,Journal of emergency nursing,2025-10-01,10.1016/j.jen.2025.08.008,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Emergency Services; Hospital Capacity Management; Crowding Scales
41026566,"In vivo analysis of conservation of tooth structure using conventional method, loupes, and dental operating microscope - A randomized clinical trial.","<h4>Aim</h4>The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the extent of tooth structure preservation, efficacy of canal orifice identification, and procedural time during access cavity preparation in primary molars indicated for pulpectomy using three different visualization techniques: the naked eye, surgical loupes, and the dental operating microscope (DOM).<h4>Methods</h4>Forty-five children aged 5-8 years who required pulpectomy and met the inclusion criteria (CTRI/2023/05/067642) were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 15 each) based on the visualization modality employed. Standardized access cavity preparations were performed under different magnifications. Postoperative images of the access cavities were obtained using a DOM and analyzed using ImageJ® software to quantify the conservation of the tooth structure. The number of canal orifices identified and the total treatment time were documented for each case. Statistical analyses were conducted using one way analysis of variance, Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference, and Chi square tests.<h4>Results</h4>Access cavity preparations performed under DOM demonstrated significantly greater conservation of tooth structure (P = 0.002) and the highest canal orifice detection rate. However, procedures performed under surgical loupes required the least amount of time (mean: 352.7 seconds). Conventional visualization is associated with more substantial structural loss and lower diagnostic precision.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Magnification-assisted endodontics significantly improves the precision of access cavity preparation. While the DOM offers optimal dentin conservation and enhanced canal orifice detection, surgical loupes strike a balance between improved visualization and procedural efficiency. The integration of magnification tools in pediatric endodontics will surely enhance clinical outcomes, although practical considerations such as cost, training, and operator adaptability must be acknowledged.",Vasa S; Choubey S; Joshi S; Mathur S,"Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, ITS Dental College, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India.",Journal of the Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry,2025-09-30,10.4103/jisppd.jisppd_225_25,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Primary Molars; Pulpectomy; Tooth Preservation; Pediatric Endodontics; Canal Identification
41042903,Odontomas in Cats: A Case Series.,"Odontomas are rare, benign odontogenic tumors in dogs, cats, humans, and other species. Although odontomas have been referenced as occurring in dogs and cats, there are no publications pertaining to odontomas in cats. This case series of nine odontomas in eight cats includes description of clinical presentations, diagnostic imaging findings, histopathologic characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Common clinical presentations in this study include missing teeth, tooth displacement, presence of a fluctuant mass, and alveolar bone expansion. Diagnostic imaging reveals a mixed radiodense central opacity containing radiopaque tooth-like structures and a variably thick radiolucent rim, consistent with compound odontomas. However, one mature odontoma in an older patient had fusion of the denticles that complicated visualization of discrete denticles radiographically. Three lesions contained unerupted teeth and two had unilocular radiolucencies consistent with cyst formation. Although radiographic findings are often highly diagnostic for odontomas, it is recommended to send an oral biopsy of the lesion to a histopathologist who has a focus on oral and maxillofacial pathology for confirmation of the diagnosis. Common treatments include either surgical en bloc resection or enucleation and curettage. In this study, both treatment types were curative and there was no documented recurrence in the cats for whom follow-up was available.",Burton K; Bell C,"Animal Dental Services, Knoxville, TN, USA.",Journal of veterinary dentistry,2025-10-03,10.1177/08987564251380119,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),cat; cyst; Feline; Radiology; Veterinary; Odontoma; Odontogenic Tumor; Dentistry
41041141,Diagnostic Musculoskeletal Ultrasound in the Evaluation of the Rectus Abdominis.,"The rectus abdominis (RA) muscle is a key muscle in the anterior abdominal wall, contributing to motion of trunk flexion, assisting with stabilization of the pelvis, and maintaining intra-abdominal pressure. Its integrity is essential for posture, respiration, and functional movement, and it is frequently implicated in clinical conditions such as abdominal wall hernias, rectus diastasis, muscle strains, and postoperative complications. Accurate evaluation of the RA is therefore critical for both diagnostic and rehabilitative purposes. Musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSKUS) has emerged as a valuable imaging modality for assessing the structure and function of the RA muscle. Offering real-time, dynamic visualization without ionizing radiation, MSKUS enables clinicians and researchers to examine muscle morphology, thickness, echogenicity, and contractile behavior with high precision. Compared with other imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, MSKUS is more accessible, cost-effective, and well-suited for repeated assessments in both clinical and research settings. Recent advances in MSKUS have expanded its role in evaluating abdominal wall musculature, particularly in populations ranging from athletes and postoperative patients to postpartum women. By providing detailed, noninvasive insights into the RA muscle, MSKUS contributes to improved diagnosis, monitoring of rehabilitation progress, and the development of targeted interventions.",Manske RC; Wolfe C; Page P; Voight M,,International journal of sports physical therapy,2025-10-02,10.26603/001c.144822,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Rehabilitation; Dynamic Imaging; Rectus Abdominis; Musculoskeletal Ultrasound; Overuse Injury
41017552,Applying small bowel endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease management.,"Inflammatory bowel disease is classified into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis involves only the colon, whereas CD is characterized by small bowel involvement, which is a hallmark feature. However, the small bowel is the final frontier of endoscopic evaluation; therefore, small bowel involvement is considered a significant medical challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CD. Endoscopic visualization and biopsy sampling of the small bowel are crucial for accurate diagnosis, effective monitoring, and management of complications of CD. Small bowel endoscopy enables the early detection of mucosal lesions, facilitates timely intervention for complications such as strictures or bleeding, and plays a critical role in reducing the need for surgical resection. Moreover, it enables targeted tissue acquisition and objective assessment of disease activity, both of which are crucial for optimal treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic responses. Given these clinical advantages, small bowel endoscopy has become an indispensable tool in the comprehensive management of CD. This review summarizes the current role and evolving advances in small bowel endoscopy, with particular emphasis on its therapeutic applications-including enteroscopic balloon dilation, endoscopic hemostasis, and foreign body retrieval-and discusses future directions based on recent evidence and expert guidelines.",Kim SJ; Hong SN,"Department of Internal Medicine, Chosun University College of Medicine, Gwangju, Korea.",Clinical endoscopy,2025-09-29,10.5946/ce.2025.144,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Balloon Enteroscopy; Crohn Disease; Small Bowel Endoscopy
41037144,Shedding light on deception: LAMP as a tool for detecting adulterants in herbal medicine.,"The integrity of herbal products is frequently undermined by both intentional and unintentional adulteration, leading to substantial health risks and economic losses. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a DNA-based molecular technique, has emerged as a formidable solution due to its simplicity, specificity, sensitivity, and ability to operate under isothermal conditions. The review critically evaluates the application of LAMP in authenticating herbal materials, showcasing its enhanced efficiency and user-friendliness compared to conventional techniques. The LAMP technique employs four to six primers that target six to eight distinct regions of the target DNA, ensuring unparalleled specificity. The amplification at a constant temperature negates the need for thermal cyclers, thus rendering it highly suitable for point-of-care applications and field-based authentication. The article presents case studies that illustrate LAMP's efficacy in detecting adulteration across traditional medicines, dietary supplements, and crude drug materials. Visualization methods in LAMP, such as turbidity, colorimetry, and fluorescence, greatly enhance its accessibility and ease of use, making it well-suited for both laboratory and field applications. Although there are limitations, such as primer design complexity and contamination risks, recent innovations, including the use of lyophilized reagents, multiplexing capabilities, and integration with mobile detection platforms, are significantly advancing the practicality of LAMP assays. This review underscores the potential of LAMP in both regulatory and commercial contexts, promoting the authenticity, safety, and quality of herbal products, thereby making a vital contribution to consumer protection and the sustainability of the herbal medicine trade.",Anju PB; Nair S,"Centre for Plant Biotechnology and Molecular Biology, College of Agriculture, Kerala Agricultural University, Thrissur, 680 656, Kerala, India.",Protoplasma,2025-10-02,10.1007/s00709-025-02117-2,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),herbal medicine; Adulteration; Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (Lamp); Species Authentication
41033664,Revolutionizing Solid Tumor Surgery with Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP)-Targeted Imaging Probes for a Fluorescence-Guided Surgery of Pancreatic Cancer.,"The development of fluorescent probes that target the tumor stroma to help surgeons detect and remove malignant lesions using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)-guided surgery is advancing rapidly. Such advancements show promise for a range of malignancies, expanding the eligibility of patients for surgical intervention and offering improved surgical outcomes. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), is highly upregulated within the tumor stroma of nearly all solid tumors. It is a promising tumor target for NIRF-guided surgery, especially in solid tumors with dense tumor stroma, such as pancreatic cancer. In this study, we aimed to develop FAP-targeting fluorescent probes with enhanced pharmacokinetics for the NIRF-guided surgery of pancreatic cancer. Three novel FAP-targeted probes (eFAPs) based on a (4-quinolinoyl)-glycyl-2-cyanopyrrolidine (QCP) structure equipped with the NIRF dye IRDye800CW were designed and synthesized. All of the probes displayed excellent inhibition potency and selectivity to FAP. The probes consistently exhibited strong inhibition and specific uptake in FAP-expressing U87 glioblastoma cells. In in vivo optical imaging studies, eFAP-24 showed a tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) of 3.1 ± 0.6 at 24 h postinjection, enabling the clear delineation of tumors using the clinical Quest Spectrum NIRF imaging system. A strong fluorescence signal in the tumor and a negligible uptake in nontarget tissues were confirmed by biodistribution analyses. The successful development and validation of FAP-targeting fluorescent probes, especially eFAP-24, offers promising prospects for enhancing the visualization of FAP-rich stromal compartments improving surgical outcomes through NIRF-guided surgery, particularly in solid tumors with dense stroma such as pancreatic cancer.",Ma H; de Muynck LDAN; Houvast RD; Beekman S; Piet A; March TL; Hawinkels LJAC; Mieog JSD; Vahrmeijer AL; Seimbille Y,"Departments of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam 3015 GD, The Netherlands.",Bioconjugate chemistry,2025-10-01,10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5c00218,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41044664,Global research trends in BPaL and BPaLM regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis: a bibliometric analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>The introduction of BPaL and BPaLM regimens has revolutionized drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, offering superior efficacy, shorter duration, and better tolerability than conventional therapies. Despite their rapid WHO guideline incorporation, no prior bibliometric analysis has been conducted on this topic. This study addresses this gap by mapping global knowledge production, collaborations, and thematic trends to inform future research and implementation strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed Scopus-indexed publications using controlled vocabulary for BPaL/BPaLM regimens. From 551 initial records, 120 met inclusion criteria after screening. Bibliometrix and VOS Viewer software evaluated publication trends, authorship, institutional/geographical contributions, citations, and keyword networks. Visualization tools mapped collaborations and thematic clusters, while statistical methods assessed growth rates and citation impacts.<h4>Results</h4>The study identified 1,081 authors, with publications growing at 11.61% annually and peaking in 2024 (n = 56). International collaborations featured in 53.33% of studies, led by the US (n = 56), UK (n = 25), and South Africa (n = 20). Johns Hopkins University was the top institution (n = 56), and Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy the leading journal (n = 15). Landmark 2019 publications had the highest citation rate (13.05/year). Thematic analysis revealed categorization into three domains: pathogen and drug resistance, treatment regimens and efficacy, and demographics and clinical studies.

41023347,Statistical Surgical Process Modeling: Analysis of Workflow and Performance of Emerging Technologies in Image-Guided Spine Surgery.,"<h4>Background</h4>Surgical process modeling (SPM) presents a rigorous ontology and useful means of understanding complex surgical workflows. Early-stage understanding of the potential benefit of emerging technologies can be gained with such an approach- for example, in image-guided spine surgery.<h4>Purpose</h4>This work extends SPM ontology to a statistical framework for computational modeling and simulation, analyzing the effect of new technologies on quantitative outcomes. Two example use cases are detailed in spine surgery-target localization with long-length imaging and pedicle screw placement with intraoperative CT and navigation.<h4>Methods</h4>The SPM ontology of phase, step, and activity was mapped to a directed graph depiction of workflow in which activities were described by statistical distributions in outcomes, parameterized and validated via retrospective and/or prospective studies, and structured within an SPM table and object-oriented computational framework. The approach was applied to quantify the influence of two example technologies in spine surgery: (1) long-length radiographic imaging for target localization (compared to conventional fluoroscopic level-counting); and (2) intraoperative CT and 3D navigation for pedicle screw placement (compared to conventional fluoroscopic guidance). Distributions in cycle time, radiation dose, and geometric accuracy were investigated, with clear depiction of median and outlier performance provided by 3D visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Statistical SPMs yielded insight on complex workflows and the potential benefits of emerging technologies. For target localization, intraoperative long-length imaging reduced median cycle time from 15.5 min (for fluoroscopic level-counting) to 13.4 min and eliminated outliers associated with visibility of markers or human error. For pedicle screw placement, 3D navigation introduced an additional median ~ 15 min procedural overhead in planning and registration but reduced median procedure time from 229 min (for fluoroscopy guidance) to 180 min. 3D navigation also quantifiably improved the geometric accuracy of screw placement and reduced the frequency of pedicle screw breach (Grade C or worse).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Statistical SPMs provide a valuable methodology to evaluate and communicate complex interventional workflows and the potential benefit of emerging technologies. Two SPM use cases were developed in the context of spine surgery and provided a basis for investigating the potential performance of emerging technologies, such as intraoperative imaging, navigation, robotic assistance, and augmented reality systems. As a framework for virtual clinical trials, statistical SPMs can provide insight on outcome measures that are difficult to evaluate in the laboratory and expensive / time-consuming to measure in prospective clinical studies.",Deva A; Rypinski TA; Pillai PS; Soni B; Sarwar O; Milhorn AC; Jones AK; Tatsui CE; Rhines LD; North RY; Alvarez-Breckenridge C; Bird JE; Siewerdsen JH,"Department of Imaging Physics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.",Annals of biomedical engineering,2025-09-29,10.1007/s10439-025-03855-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Optimization; Image-guided Surgery; Spine Surgery; Implementation Science; Intraoperative Imaging; Surgical Process Model
41045314,In silico identification of anticancer flavonoids as dengue virus replication inhibitors: a molecular docking and simulation approach.,"<h4>Context</h4>Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease endemic to over 100 countries, poses a serious health risk to people living in tropical regions. The viral non-structural proteins NS3 (helicase) and NS5 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) are critical targets for antiviral drug development. Several natural and synthetic compounds have been tried against this for the screening of antiviral inhibitor(s) but so far limited success has been achieved. In this study, we have investigated how natural products interact with and destabilize NS3 and NS5. We used in silico methods to screen new potential NS3 and NS5 inhibitors from various anti-cancer flavonoid compounds that previously showed anti-cancer properties in vitro. A virtual screening was conducted on 329 anti-cancer flavonoid compounds, selecting 190 compounds based on Lipinski's rule of five, the Muegge filter, the Ghose filter, and the Veber filter. Molecular docking techniques allowed us to identify Artobiloxanthone (PubChem CID: 46887866) as the most effective binder for NS3, while Glabridin (PubChem CID: 124052) emerged as the most effective binder for NS5. These leading candidates demonstrated favorable ADMET profiles. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of up to 1000-ns showcased stable protein-ligand interactions, with convergence achieved at 200 ns for NS3 and 470 ns for NS5. The structural stability of the complexes was validated by analyzing root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding). Binding affinity between the ligand and target proteins was further validated by binding free energy calculations using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) approach, providing a robust estimation of interaction stability. These findings highlight the potential of Artobiloxanthone and Glabridin as promising inhibitors of dengue virus replication.<h4>Methods</h4>The Chimera v1.11.2 program was employed for protein optimization, while PyRx 0.8 served for molecular docking. Protein structures were converted into.pdbqt format, and ligands were energy-minimized using the MMFF94 force field and conjugate gradient optimization. Visualization was conducted using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer and PyMOL. The ADMET properties of the top hits were predicted using the pkCSM and ProTox-II platforms. To address missing residues in the crystal structures, AlphaFold2 was used to predict full-length protein models. MD simulations were performed with the GROMACS 2024.5 package, utilizing the AMBER-f99SB-ILDN force field, the TIP3P water model, and a 120 mM NaCl concentration. Equilibration was achieved through V-rescale and C-rescale thermostats, followed by Parrinello-Rahman barostat production runs. Analysis of the MD trajectories included RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, H-bonding, and MM-PBSA utilizing GROMACS tools, gmx_MMPBSA, VMD, and MDAnalysis.",Patra S; Paul A; Shand H; Ghosal S; Ghorai S,"Infection and Disease Biology Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Raiganj University, Raiganj, West Bengal, 733134, India.",Journal of molecular modeling,2025-10-04,10.1007/s00894-025-06516-3,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Molecular docking; Molecular simulation; Dengue; Admet; Ns5 Rdrp; Flavonoid Inhibitor; Ns3-Helicase
41028141,Novel approach to determine components size in a total ankle replacement.,"As a total ankle replacement (TAR) prosthesis has been developed and improved in terms of design and surgical technique, it could be expected to lead to a successful functional outcome in the ankle joint. However, several complications of the TAR procedure may be often caused by an incomplete understanding of the abnormal biomechanics of the ankle joint and the prosthesis design of the TAR. This study was performed to suggest a novel approach to determine the TAR prosthesis size by using an orthopedic digital templating software based on a comparison between X-ray and CT images. This study was examined in a novel approach to determine the prosthesis size by using an orthopedic digital templating software (Orthoview™, Florida, USA) based on the comparison between X-ray and CT images. A total 6 types of clinical foot and ankle images were obtained from x-ray and CT of 55 subjects in the coronal and sagittal plane. The x-ray images magnified as 100% and 115% based on the CT images. All subjects were diagnosed to the ankle osteoarthritis with stage 2-4 according to Takakura's ankle OA classification. To predict the appropriate component sizes of the TAR prosthesis, the same TAR prosthesis (HINTEGRA, Newdeal, France) was chosen, and the tibial and the the talar component sizes were selected until by adapting to the osteotomized range of the tibia and talus. The unskilled surgeons predicted the sizes of the TAR components before procedure by using the orthopedic digital templating software. These predicted sizes were then compared with the selected sizes by the specialist surgeon during the procedure. The Cohen's Kappa correlation coefficient was applied to statistically analyze the agreement between the predicted and selected sizes of the TAR components for unskilled and specialist surgeons, respectively. On the CT images, the average agreement rate was relatively higher than on the x-ray images at over 77%. Especially, highest agreement rate was shown at the tibial component in the coronal plane with almost 80%, followed by over 75% in the sagittal plane. In the talar part, the agreement rate was shown to be over 76% in the coronal and sagittal plane, respectively. Overall, the predicted size from the CT image was more consistent with the size selected by the specialist surgeon than the X-ray image. In conclusion, the application of the orthopedic digital templating software based on CT images may expect to provide more complete and detailed visualization to predict the appropriate size of the TAR components than conventional X-ray images which would be limited by relatively lower sensitivity and specificity as well as overlapping the adjacent bones.",Lee JM; Lee SW,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Dongsan Hospital, Keimyung University, 1035, Dalgubeol-daero, Daegu, Republic of Korea.",Scientific reports,2025-09-30,10.1038/s41598-025-13004-4,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Arthritis; X-ray; CT; Ankle; Prosthesis; Total Ankle Replacement; Digital Template
41027026,Assessment of a Digital Platform for Routine Outcome Monitoring in Psychotherapy: Usability Study and Thematic Analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>The integration of digital tools into psychotherapy has gained increasing attention, particularly for practices such as routine outcome monitoring (ROM), which involves the regular collection of patient-reported data to inform treatment decisions. However, despite the potential benefits, the adoption of digital platforms remains limited, partly due to usability concerns and workflow misalignment.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to assess the usability of a digital platform, Mindy, designed to support psychotherapists in implementing ROM and to explore broader challenges associated with the integration of digital tools into psychotherapeutic practice.<h4>Methods</h4>This study adopted a qualitative, 2-stage approach. Sixteen psychotherapists participated in semistructured interviews, which included task-based usability testing and reflective discussions. Participants interacted with Mindy by performing typical clinical tasks, such as creating patient profiles, managing session data, and sending questionnaires. The first stage of analysis used a deductive thematic approach focused on predefined platform functionalities. The second stage followed an inductive methodology to identify broader themes related to the integration of digital tools in psychotherapy.<h4>Results</h4>The usability assessment identified strengths in the platform's appointment scheduling, questionnaire delivery, and dashboard functionalities, which were perceived as intuitive and supportive of ROM practices. However, limitations were reported in areas such as documentation flexibility, interoperability with other systems, and control over information sharing with patients. Broader thematic analysis revealed three main challenges: (1) the tension between standardized documentation and the need for narrative and implicit information; (2) difficulties in embedding digital platforms into existing therapeutic workflows, especially for clinicians less familiar with technology; and (3) concerns about confidentiality and the potential for misinterpretation when sharing therapeutic notes with patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings underscore the importance of considering both technical and contextual dimensions when developing and implementing digital platforms in mental health care. Tailoring digital tools to the needs and practices of psychotherapists may improve adoption and ultimately enhance the quality of care.",Olive MV; La Tona A; Lo Coco G; Compare A; Cafazzo JA; Masella C,"Department of Management, Economics and Industrial Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Via Raffaele Lambruschini 4B, Milano, 20156, Italy, 39 3488676027.",JMIR medical informatics,2025-09-30,10.2196/75885,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Usability; psychotherapy; Routine Outcome Monitoring; Digital Tools; Digital Mental Health
