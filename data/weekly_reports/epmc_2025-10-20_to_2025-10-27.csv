40779696,"Optimizing and Automating Aggregation and Visualization of COVID-19 Data in Metro Manila, Philippines, Through the Use of a Free Dashboard Software: A Case Study.","In response to an increased demand for data, staff from the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit of the Department of Health Metro Manila developed an internal dashboard to automate the aggregation and visualization of COVID-19 data from multiple sources, thereby decreasing the time taken to complete the process by approximately 35 minutes, or more than half the duration of the original workflow. Time, financial, and human resource constraints were overcome with staff commitment and communication, and the approach was scaled to develop dashboards for other surveillance systems. Dashboards are useful for aggregation and visualization of data at the subnational level, but they are not replacements for critical review and effective communication of data. Further studies on dashboard development will help establish a framework and promote a new standard for public health organizations at the subnational level.",Ong KPS,"Author Affiliations: Department of Health (Philippines), Manila, Philippines, and Monash University (Ong), Melbourne, Australia.",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,2025-10-21,10.1097/phh.0000000000002215,14.7,"visualization(title,abstract); dashboard(kw,title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); data(title,abstract)",Surveillance; Philippines; Public Health; Dashboard; Covid-19
41124568,DermaDashboard: Bridging the Gap Between FHIR Standards and Clinical Usability.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Over the past decade, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) have become increasingly relevant in health care data standardization. However, the complex structure of FHIR makes cohort analytics with many-to-many relations extremely time-consuming, and, impossible in many cases. To support exploratory cohort building and data visualization in oncology, especially for nontechnical users, we developed the DermaDashboard, an interactive dashboard built on top of a relational FHIR-compliant PostgreSQL database. Relevant oncology data was preaggregated with a materialized view, and the subsequent visualization layer was implemented using an open-source visualization tool, enabling clinicians to filter and analyze data without requiring familiarity with FHIR or SQL. The database encompassed data from 3949 patients with melanoma and included 82,783 health records. Core FHIR resources were Patient, DiagnosticReport, and QuestionnaireResponse, with 54 mapped attributes spanning demographics, stagings, mutations, and treatments. The resulting dashboard allowed filtering across 29 variables to construct subcohorts and generate aggregation analyses. This implementation shows how open interoperability data standards, such as FHIR, can be used in the development of modular, user-friendly clinical dashboards for cohort analysis, and the architecture demonstrates a feasible path toward democratizing access to structured health care data.",Borys K; Hartmann EM; Idrissi-Yaghir A; Livingstone E; Lodde G; Schmidt CS; Winnekens P; Friedrich CM; Hosch R; Nensa F,"Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Essen University Hospital, Essen, Germany.",JMIR cancer,2025-10-22,10.2196/73691,10.9,"visualization(abstract); dashboard(kw,title,abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Melanoma; Data acquisition; Interoperability; Analytics; Dashboard; Fhir; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
41128352,A multifaceted approach to advancing data quality and fitness standards in multi-institutional networks.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To construct a data quality (DQ) system that incorporates combinations of methods to evaluate data characteristics and analytic fitness across research questions for multiple uses.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Drawing from experience of other data quality programs, network data extraction needs, and recurring study requirements, we developed 5 standards to guide development of a modular, multifaceted data quality system. These included annotation and documentation, ability to measure research readiness, reproducibility across networks, flexibility for the user, and interpretability to research and project teams. Implementation of checks based on these principles focused on reusability and interactive visualization of results.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 10 check types producing over 444 check applications and deployed them in 2 multi-institutional networks. Check types span structural conformance to a data model, utility for common research needs, and study-specific customization. All check types are customizable without dependencies between them. A dashboard visualizes results, permitting adjustments based on number of data sources, need for source masking, and the user's focus. All components can be applied as written to any data source using OMOP and are readily modified for other data models.<h4>Discussion</h4>We have extended previous work through our novel and multifaceted approach to data quality assessment, addressing needs in both network data improvement and research usage. We developed a capable and deployable system rather than tailoring to specific use cases.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our novel DQ assessment system provides essential components for future standardization and collaboration to improve fitness of clinical data for intended use.",Razzaghi H; Dickinson K; Wieand K; Boss S; Weidlich H; Huang Y; Morse K; Mutyala SK; Nandagopal JPA; Viswanathan K; Forrest CB; Bailey LC,"Applied Clinical Research Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19146, United States.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2025-10-23,10.1093/jamia/ocaf181,9.3,"visualization(abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,title,abstract); electronic health record(kw)",Data Quality; Electronic Health Records; Learning Health Systems; Multi-institutional Research; Clinical Research Networks
41124022,"MRanalysis: A Comprehensive Online Platform for Integrated, Multi-Method Mendelian Randomization and Associated Post-GWAS Analyses.","<h4>Background</h4>Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful epidemiological method for inferring causal relationships between exposures and outcomes using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. However, its adoption is limited by inconsistent data formats, lack of standardized workflows, and the need for programming expertise. To address these challenges, we developed MRanalysis, a user-friendly, web-based platform for integrated MR analysis, and GWASkit, a standalone tool for GWAS data preprocessing.<h4>Results</h4>MRanalysis provides a comprehensive, no-code workflow for MR analysis, including data quality assessment, power estimation, SNP-to-gene enrichment, and visualization. It supports univariable, multivariable, and mediation MR analyses through an intuitive interface. GWASkit facilitates rapid GWAS data preprocessing, such as rs ID conversion and format standardization, with significantly higher accuracy and efficiency than existing tools. Case studies demonstrate the utility and efficiency of both tools in real-world scenarios.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MRanalysis and GWASkit lower barriers to MR analysis, making it more accessible, reliable, and efficient. By democratizing MR, these tools can accelerate discoveries in genetic epidemiology, inform public health strategies, and guide targeted interventions.

41125188,Visualization of thermosensitive hydroxypropyl chitin with aggregation-induced emission features for sustained-release drug delivery.,"Hydroxypropyl chitin (HPCH) has been studied as a carrier for drug delivery due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and reversible thermosensitivity. However, the behaviors of the erosion/degradation of HPCH and release of drug for drug-loaded HPCH in vivo are unclear. Visualization of the drug-loaded HPCH could reveal the location and degradation of the carrier, and the release and distribution of the drug in vivo, which is more beneficial for promoting the clinical translation. Herein, we simultaneously tracked HPCH labeled by aggregation-induced emission fluorogens (AnDA-HPCH) and a model drug (indocyanine green, ICG) in vitro and in vivo without mutual interference. The erosion/degradation rate of AnDA-HPCH and the drug release of ICG from the ICG-loaded AnDA-HPCH sponge implanted in the buttock of mice were slower than those of the injected hydrogel containing the same amounts of drug and polymer. Further, the long-acting local anesthetic ropivacaine-loaded HPCH sponge implanted in the back of rats showed an effective analgesic time of approximately 30 h, which was 3-fold longer than that with the injected RPH@HPCH hydrogel (10 h) and much longer (6 times) than that of the xaracoll-like formulation (5 h).

41136704,Pre- and Postoperative Visualization in Rhinoplasty: Effects of LED Light Panels in Aesthetic Photography on Image Integrity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lighting conditions for photographic documentation during pre- and postoperative visits are critical in capturing the outcomes of rhinoplasty for patients. Current standards may not provide direct side lighting, which can enhance visualization of uneven textures. We present a revised studio setup with dual-function background lights positioned perpendicular to the subject-camera axis to provide both back and side lighting.<h4>Methods</h4>Rhinoplasty pictures were taken in an academic hospital clinic office from six standard angles for pre- and postoperative photography. Two foreground LED continuous lights were placed at 45 degrees relative to the subject-camera axis. An additional two LED continuous lights were angled perpendicularly to the subject-camera axis and positioned at approximately half the distance between the subject and background. Rapid colorimetric image analysis was conducted, and Hex color values were compared to a reference photograph to evaluate colorimetric distortion [4]. Paired images were evaluated by four blinded providers to evaluate nasal structure distortion, image sharpness, image noise, and overall clinical fidelity.<h4>Results</h4>Color accuracy was maintained for the four-light and two-light conditions in the frontal view, with 97% and 94% fidelity compared to the true reference, respectively. In the right oblique view, fidelity for the four-light system was 99% as compared to 100% for the two-light system. Subjective provider ratings established the proposed lighting system as superior in terms of overall clinical fidelity to the standard two-light conditions in nearly all angles (87.5%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study focuses on moving beyond primarily two foreground lighting which may be limited in terms of side-lighting effects and resultant impact on overall image quality in the goals of optimizing pre- and post-operative documentation.<h4>Level of evidence iv</h4>This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

41136966,Decoding the human tongue of light chain amyloidosis in three dimensions (3D): three-dimensional pathological visualization drives early and precise screening of suspected cases.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to apply CUBIC tissue clearing combined with three-dimensional (3D) imaging to visualize the pathological architecture of systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis in the human tongue, assess spatial and microstructural changes associated with amyloid deposition, and explore its potential to enhance early diagnostic accuracy.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Seven tongue specimens from confirmed AL amyloidosis cases underwent CUBIC processing, multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and 3D imaging. Vascular density, surface area, vessel and muscle fiber diameters were compared between amyloid deposition and non-deposition regions. Ten additional specimens initially negative for AL amyloidosis were re-evaluated using the same procedure, suspected cases were verified by repeat histology and clinical follow-up.<h4>Results</h4>In amyloid deposition regions, vascular density and surface area were (0.14 ± 0.04) μm<sup>3</sup> and (0.46 ± 0.11) μm<sup>2</sup>, showing 50.0% and 33.3% reductions compared to non-deposition regions [(0.28 ± 0.06) μm<sup>3</sup> and (0.69 ± 0.12) μm<sup>2</sup>]. Median vessel diameter in vessels with luminal amyloid deposition was 5.99 μm (IQR: 5.07-7.39), 30.5% smaller than that in vessels without deposition [8.62 μm (IQR: 7.26-11.03)]. Muscle fibers surrounded by amyloid deposits had a diameter of (3.62 ± 0.28)μm, slightly smaller than that of fibers without deposition [(3.70 ± 0.23)] μm. All differences were significant (P < 0.05). Among the ten initially negative cases, five were reclassified as highly suspected and one was confirmed during follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CUBIC-based 3D imaging enables detailed visualization and quantification of amyloid-associated microstructural changes in tongue tissue, providing deeper insight into disease mechanisms and serving as a valuable complement to conventional histopathology for enhancing early diagnostic accuracy in AL amyloidosis.",Wu L; Sun F; Xu S; Gao X; Chen J; Zhang Z; Liu Z; Qu Y; Wang Z,"Department of Stomatology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, 8 Gongti South Road, Beijing, 100020, China.",BMC oral health,2025-10-24,10.1186/s12903-025-06939-7,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Tongue; Early diagnosis; Histopathology; Three-dimensional Imaging; Tissue Clearing; Amyloidosis Al
41131376,Visual marker-based augmented reality for intraoperative ultrasound in minimally invasive surgery.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) is essential in minimally invasive hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgery but requires surgeons to alternate attention between laparoscopic and ultrasound monitors, disrupting workflow. We developed Flag AR, an augmented reality system that superimposes real-time ultrasound images onto laparoscopic displays using visual marker tracking.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective observational study included 14 patients undergoing minimally invasive hepatobiliary-pancreatic procedures between March and April 2025. Three experienced surgeons performed target identification tasks using both Flag AR and conventional IOUS. Eye-tracking analysis measured gaze shifts and visual focus time using wearable eye-tracking glasses.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-six anatomical targets were evaluated, including liver tumors (n = 13), gallbladder tumors (n = 4), and vascular structures (n = 9). Although task completion time showed no significant difference between modalities (23.8 vs. 22.1 s, P = 0.351), Flag AR significantly reduced gaze shifts compared to conventional IOUS (1.8 vs. 8.4 shifts, P < 0.001) and increased time focused on a single monitor (97.9% vs. 73.8%, P < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Flag AR represents the first clinical application of purely visual marker-based ultrasound overlay technology in minimally invasive surgery. By enabling sustained visual focus on a single display, this system improves surgeon workflow efficiency during IOUS procedures without compromising task performance, potentially enhancing spatial visualization and reducing cognitive workload in complex surgical procedures.",Takamoto T; Kazami Y; Nishioka Y; Ichida A; Akamatsu N; Kawaguchi Y; Hasegawa K,"Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery Division, Artificial Organ and Transplantation Division, Department of Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. takamotot-sur@h.u-tokyo.ac.jp.",Surgical endoscopy,2025-10-23,10.1007/s00464-025-12326-8,6.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract)",Eye Tracking; minimally invasive surgery; Augmented Reality; Ntraoperative Ultrasonography; Visual Marker Tracking
41121298,An interpretable machine learning model integrating computed tomography radiomics and clinical features for predicting the urosepsis after percutaneous nephrolithotomy.,"<h4>Background</h4>The urosepsis after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a critical health risk necessitating prompt medical identification and intervention. Nevertheless, a deficiency exists in the availability of a tool for precise and timely predictive analysis. The purpose is to establish a machine learning (ML) model using radiomic features and clinical data to predict urosepsis following PCNL.<h4>Method</h4>This study retrospectively included 401 patients with kidney stones from two centers who underwent PCNL. To enhance the dataset's equilibrium, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique for regression with Gaussian noise (SMOGN) was used to resample the training set. The screening of radiomics features and the construction of radiomics scores were completed by applying the Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO). Subsequently, the critical clinical indicators for urosepsis were pinpointed through the application of a multivariate logistic regression. The performance of seven ML algorithms was compared for the combined dataset that incorporated clinical variables and radiomics scores. The efficacy of these models was assessed through the implementation of a fivefold cross-validation process. Ultimately, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methodology was utilized to provide a visual and interpretative analysis of the optimal model.<h4>Result</h4>Among 401 patients, 30 cases (7.48%) were diagnosed with urosepsis. The radiomics score, established by 13 radiomics features, was combined with six important clinical features (including urine nitrite positivity, stone volume, mean intrarenal pressures, urine white blood cells, and operation time) to construct a combined dataset. Comparative analysis of seven machine learning (ML) models revealed that CatBoost demonstrated superior predictive performance. The model achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) values of 0.88, 0.94, and 0.89 on the training, internal test, and external validation sets, respectively. Corresponding area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) values were 0.92, 0.75, and 0.63. The SHAP value method identifies key features influencing prediction outcomes, with the radiomics score and urine nitrite positivity being the top contributors to the model. We deployed the optimal prediction model to a web for clinical application ( https://predictive-model-for-urosepsis.streamlit.app/ ).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study constructed a predictive model that incorporates clinical risk characteristics and radiomics scores to assess the risk of urosepsis after PCNL, with SHAP visualization for clinical physicians to formulate evaluation strategies.",Zeng S; Cao Z; Xu H; Yang C; Wang K; Yang Y; Qiu X; Xiao Y; Zhang X; Fu Q; Wang W,"Department of Urology, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command, The First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Liuhua Road No.111, Guangzhou, 510010, China.",Biomedical engineering online,2025-10-21,10.1186/s12938-025-01460-y,5.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(title,abstract); data(abstract)",Kidney stones; Urosepsis; Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy; Radiomics; The Shapley Additive Explanation
41116615,A clinical visualization model for predicting distant metastasis and prognostic outcomes in mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: a SEER database study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix (MACA) has high metastatic potential and poor prognosis, lacking predictive models. This study aimed to establish models for assessing distant metastasis (DM) risk and survival prognosis of MACA patients with DM.<h4>Research design and methods</h4>SEER database data of MACA patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2021 were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified DM risk factors, while Cox regression determined prognostic factors for DM patients. Two nomograms were created and evaluated via ROC curves, calibration curves, and DCA. Results: A total of 1722 patients with MACA were included, and 832 patients had DM at the time of diagnosis. The independent risk factors for DM in patients with MACA include gender, age, tumor size, T stage, and N stage. For MACA patients with DM, age, N stage, and surgical treatment were independent risk factors for overall survival (OS). The diagnostic and prognostic nomograms showed good discriminatory ability and calibration. The independent prognostic factors for MACA patients with DM are age, N stage, and surgery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The established diagnostic and prognostic models can quantitatively assess the risk and prognosis of MACA with DM, providing more effective guidance for clinical decision-making.",Xu X; Chen H; Wang J,"Department of Gastroenterology, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, Jining, China.",Expert review of anticancer therapy,2025-10-21,10.1080/14737140.2025.2576623,5.3,"visualization(title); visual(title); data(title,abstract)",Prognosis; Metastasis; Predictor; Nomogram; Mucinous Adenocarcinoma Of The Appendix

41134514,Visualizing Improvements in Airway Dysfunction After Inhaled Therapy in Patients With Uncontrolled Asthma: A Narrative Review.,"Clinical trials investigating asthma therapies typically rely on pulmonary function tests including spirometry markers, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s, to evaluate efficacy. While these measures provide insights into the action of bronchodilators on global lung function, their specific effects on the airways and the relationship between clinical improvements and airway dysfunction remains poorly understood. In recent years, pulmonary functional imaging methods, such as hyperpolarized <sup>129</sup>Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have enabled the analysis of airway dysfunction in patients with asthma utilizing ventilation defect percent (VDP). In this narrative review, we summarize clinical evidence about the impact of inhaled bronchodilator therapies on airway dysfunction in patients with asthma, focusing on studies that utilized <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI to visualize and quantify MRI VDP. <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI VDP has been shown to be a well-tolerated and sensitive technique for enabling the visualization and quantification of airway functional changes over time in patients with asthma. This has been shown not only in a controlled clinical trial environment but also in a real-world setting, in patients with both controlled and poorly controlled asthma. A recent study evaluating single-inhaler triple therapy in patients with uncontrolled moderate-severe asthma, despite inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β<sub>2</sub>-agonist maintenance therapy, demonstrated that daily fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 µg) led to significantly improved <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI VDP after only 6 weeks, which was in line with broader central/distal airway function and quality of life improvements. These results highlight the capacity of <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI VDP to detect early responses to treatment. In addition, the mechanistic insights provided by <sup>129</sup>Xe MRI VDP also indicated that these benefits are likely due to the combination of UMEC (a long-acting muscarinic antagonist) and an efficacious inhaled corticosteroid, addressing undertreated inflammatory bronchoconstriction, helping to restore airway caliber and function that more closely resemble the airways of a healthy individual.Videos available for this article.",Tcherner S; Mozaffaripour A; Yamashita C; Parraga G,"Robarts Research Institute, Western University, London, Canada.",Advances in therapy,2025-10-24,10.1007/s12325-025-03392-4,4.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Asthma; Airway Dysfunction; Ventilation Defect Percent; Ics/lama/laba; 129Xe Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Fluticasone Furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol
41125735,Global DNA methylation signatures associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis of high grade serous ovarian cancer.,"Ovarian cancer (OVCA) is third most lethal gynecologic cancers and acquired chemoresistance is the key link in the high mortality rate of OVCA patients. Currently, there are no reliable methods to predict chemoresistance in OVCA. In our study, we identify genes, pathways and networks altered by DNA methylation in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) cells that are associated with chemoresistance and prognosis of HGSC patients. We performed methylome-wide profiling using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (HM850K) methylation array on a set of HGSC chemoresistant and chemosensitive cell lines. Differentially Methylated CpG Probes (DMPs) were identified between the resistant and sensitive groups in HGSC. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) over-representation analyses were conducted to identify both common and unique pathways between resistant and sensitive cells. While the HM850K array was used for the discovery phase to identify differentially methylated probes and regions in HGSC cell lines, the publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas ovarian cancer (TCGA-OV) dataset generated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (27 K array) methylation array served as an independent validation cohort for downstream survival and drug sensitivity analyses. Machine learning methods were applied to our dataset to predict drug sensitivity in the TCGA-OV cohort and to investigate associations with overall survival and progression-free survival. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the relationship between differentially methylated genes and patient survival outcomes. The overlapping CpG probes shared between the two Illumina platforms were used for machine learning and survival analyses. Data visualization was performed using various R/Bioconductor packages. Our analysis identified a total of 3,641 DMPs spanning 1,617 differentially methylated genes between chemoresistant and sensitive HGSC cells, whereas 80% of them were hypermethylated CpG sites associated with HGSC resistant cells. Approximately half of the DMPs were distributed on chromosomes 1-3, 6, 11-12 and 17 and top identified hypermethylated CpGs were cg21226224 (SOX17, ∆β = 79%, adj.P = 7.73E-03), cg02538901 (ATP1A1, ∆β = 75%, adj.P = 7.6E-03), and cg17032184 (CD58, ∆β = 64%, adj.P = 4.39E-02). Machine learning analysis identified significant association of global hypermethylation in the HGSC chemoresistant cells with poor overall and progression-free survival of HGSC patients. Further analysis identified four differentially methylated genes (CD58, SOX17, FOXA1, ETV1) that were also positively associated with poor prognosis of HGSC OC patients. Functional enrichment analysis showed enrichment of several cancer-related pathways, including phosphatidylinositol signaling, homologous recombination and ECM-receptor interaction pathways. This study supplements the current knowledge of the underlying mechanism behind acquired chemoresistance in OVCA. Four differentially methylated genes identified in this study may have the potential to serve as promising epigenetic clinical biomarkers for HGSC chemotherapy resistance.",Manzoor HB; Acun M; Yasavoli-Sharahi H; Matar C; Mer A; Tsang BK; Asare-Werehene M,"Inflammation and Chronic Disease Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, K1H 8L6, Canada.",Scientific reports,2025-10-22,10.1038/s41598-025-20827-8,4.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(abstract),
41134958,Data-driven study on why wrist pulse can assess health conditions.,"Pulse diagnosis (PD) is a traditional diagnostic technique for health assessments, wherein experienced physicians palpate the wrist pulse at the radial artery to evaluate an individual's health status. However, the scientific validity of PD has been questioned due to the lack of quantitative and objective evidence. Specifically, variations in wrist pulse waves across different health conditions remain underexplored. A fundamental challenge lies in the quantitative characterization of pulse waveforms and their correlations with underlying physiological or pathological states. To fill these gaps, we design a data-driven analysis architecture consisting of a quantitative analysis method, medical knowledge, and association establishment. The quantitative analysis method systematically quantifies the pulse waves and presents the pulse characteristics, typical pulse wave, feature distributions, and recognition performance. Experiments on 900 samples demonstrate significant differences in pulse waveforms from various disease categories. Further, feature visualization and classification present distinct variations in pulse across different health conditions. By integrating the quantitative results with medical knowledge, we establish the correlations between wrist pulse and health status, interpreting how physiological changes influence pulse waveform morphology. This study is the first to quantitatively explore why pulse wave is able to evaluate health conditions, thereby addressing longstanding skepticism surrounding pulse diagnosis. The findings of this work significantly enhance PD's credibility.",Guo C; Dai S; Zhang C; Jiang Z; Wu B; Zhang D,,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2025-10-24,10.1109/jbhi.2025.3598165,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
40839800,Adaptation and Development of the Equity Mapping Tool for Community Care Organizations Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"<h4>Context</h4>The Equity Mapping Tool (EMT), a set of integrated tools providing rapid up-to-date COVID-19 data was previously developed for local health departments and health care systems in Franklin County, Ohio, to guide decisions about mobile vaccination. We aimed to engage, extend, and enhance the EMT to 12 Pathway Community HUBs (HUBs) in Ohio, connecting at-risk individuals to health and social services across 61 counties.<h4>Program</h4>This was an innovation demonstration project in HUBs to increase community resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the project goals was to provide Community Health Workers (CHWs) working with HUBs with local data for local decisions to advance the health of all Ohioans by engaging, extending, and enhancing the EMT.<h4>Implementation</h4>We used a continuous improvement process called the Engagement, Analytics, Translation (EAT) Framework to engage, extend, and enhance the EMT for HUBs. Engagement activities consisted of focus groups with HUB staff and consultation with CHW Advisory Council, facilitated the co-creation of EMT tools for HUBs and their subsequent enhancement. These activities guided analytics tasks by identifying data requirements, curation, and guiding the development of reports and dashboard for the extended EMT. In translation phase, EMT products were disseminated to HUBs, whose feedback during subsequent engagement activities guided further analytical workflows to enhance EMT.<h4>Results</h4>Engagement activities resulted in the identification of shared goals. Public health data needs of HUBs were centered around their populations served, health disparities of focus, and services provided. The capacity to access the EMT interactive dashboard and PDF reports was extended to all 12 HUBs.<h4>Discussion</h4>The collaboration between academic, public health, and community health partners was critical to extending and enhancing the EMT to HUBs. Cycles of EAT helped to be responsive to HUBs' need for data and build their capacity for improving community resiliency.",Karale Y; Moore R; Hasenstab KA; Baker C; Johnson A; Hyder A,"Author Affiliations: Division of Environmental Health Sciences, College of Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA (Drs.

41134433,Diagnostic performance of transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasound for vocal cord paralysis after esophagectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Vocal cord paralysis (VCP) caused by recurrent laryngeal nerve injury is a common complication following esophagectomy, particularly in patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). It may lead to dysphonia, aspiration, and pneumonia, significantly impacting recovery and prognosis. Transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasound (TLUSG) has emerged as a non-invasive tool for evaluating vocal cord function; however, its diagnostic performance relative to endoscopy remains unclear. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science through January 2025. Studies comparing TLUSG with endoscopy in patients after esophagectomy were included. Two independent reviewers screened articles, extracted data (e.g., patient demographics and diagnostic measures), and assessed study quality using the QUADAS-2 tool. Pooled diagnostic metrics including sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using RevMan and Stata. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the impact of inspection timing, reference standard, gender ratio, and age. Five studies involving 286 patients were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of TLUSG were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.55-0.92) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.79-0.99), respectively. The DOR was 65.53 (95% CI: 17.41-246.75), and the AUC was 0.95, indicating excellent diagnostic accuracy. The overall vocal cord visualization rate was 92.3%, and the pooled incidence of VCP was 29%. Subgroup analysis showed that inspection timing, reference standard, and gender ratio influenced diagnostic accuracy, while age had no significant effect. Deeks' funnel plot revealed no evidence of publication bias, though the small number of studies limits definitive conclusions. TLUSG demonstrates relatively good diagnostic performance in detecting postoperative VCP. However, a non-negligible false-negative rate (approximately 20%) remains, warranting cautious interpretation in clinical settings, especially for high-risk patients. Further prospective multicenter studies are needed to standardize TLUSG protocols and improve visualization, particularly in elderly patients.",Luo X; Xiong J; Liang S; Jiang Z; Chen H; Han Y; Daiko H; Wang I; Leng X; Zhu Y,"Department of Ultrasound, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, People's Republic of China.",Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,2025-10-24,10.1007/s10388-025-01159-y,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Meta-analysis; Esophageal cancer; Vocal Cord Paralysis; Diagnostic Accuracy; Transcutaneous Laryngeal Ultrasound
41121638,Non-Invasive Imaging in Post-Radiotherapy Monitoring of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer.,"Non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, are the most common forms of skin cancer worldwide. Though less aggressive than melanoma, they cause significant morbidity if untreated. Radiotherapy is a common treatment alternative for patients for whom surgery is contraindicated, particularly the elderly or those with tumors in anatomically challenging locations. Effective post-radiotherapy monitoring assesses treatment response, recurrence, and complications. Traditional post-radiotherapy monitoring often involves clinical examination and, if needed, invasive biopsies. Recently, noninvasive imaging modalities, such as reflectance confocal microscopy and line-field confocal optical coherence tomography, have gained attention. These technologies provide high-resolution, in vivo skin visualization. Reflectance confocal microscopy and line-field confocal optical coherence tomography offer complementary imaging data, facilitating the identification of residual tumor cells, inflammatory changes, and radiotherapy-induced skin alterations. They are valuable for follow-up as they monitor skin without biopsy. Early studies suggest high sensitivity and specificity in detecting treatment response and complications. Reflectance confocal microscopy and line-field confocal optical coherence tomography represent promising noninvasive tools for post-radiotherapy assessment of non-melanoma skin cancers. They enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce the need for biopsies, and may improve patient outcomes through earlier detection of recurrence or complications. Further studies are warranted to standardize imaging criteria and validate their routine clinical use.",Sobolewski P; Koper M; Walecka I,"Dermatology Clinic, National Institute of Medicine of the Ministry of Interior and Administration, Warsaw, Poland.",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2025-10-22,10.12659/msm.949669,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41137425,Global Insights and Key Trends in Objective Structured Clinical Examination Research Related to Residency Training: A Bibliometric Analysis.,"This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to chart global research trends on the OSCE and residency training. Data were sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection database, covering research conducted from January 1999 to June 2024. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were employed to analyze the selected studies, evaluating publication trends, key contributors, and emerging topics through the co-occurrence mapping and network visualization. In total, 211 publications were identified. From 2005 to 2024, there was an increase in publications related to the OSCE and standardized residency training. The United States and Canada emerged as dominant contributor. Institutional collaborations were led by the University of Ottawa, New York University, and the University of Toronto. The most frequent keywords included ""OSCE"" (71 occurrences), ""residents"" (56 occurrences), ""performance"" (51 occurrences), ""competence"" (35 occurrences), ""skills"" (35 occurrences), ""education"" (31 occurrences), ""medical education"" (29 occurrences), ""reliability"" (23 occurrences), ""medical students"" (17 occurrences), ""validity"" (17 occurrences), and ""clinical competence"" (17 occurrences).

41120976,Deep learning based CT images for lung function prediction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>The World Health Organization predicts that by 2030, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be the third leading cause of death and the seventh leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) are the gold standard for COPD diagnosis. Since COPD is an incurable disease that takes a considerable amount of time to diagnose, even by an experienced specialist, it becomes important to provide an analysis of abnormalities in a simple manner. Although many deep learning (DL) methods based on computed tomography (CT) have been developed to identify COPD, the pathological changes of COPD based on CT are multi-dimensional and highly spatially heterogeneous, and their predictive performance still needs to be improved.<h4>Objective</h4>The purpose of this study was to develop a DL-based multimodal feature fusion model to accurately estimate PFT parameters from chest CT images and verify its performance.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this retrospective study, participants underwent chest CT examination and PFT at the Fourth Clinical Medical College of Xinjiang Medical University between January 2018 and July 2024. In this study, the 1-s forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), 1-s forced expiratory volume ratio forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), 1-s forced expiratory volume to predicted value (FEV1%), and forced vital capacity to predicted value (FVC%) of PFT parameters were used as predictors and the corresponding chest CT of 3108 participants. The data were randomly assigned to the training group and the validation group at a ratio of 9:1, and the model was cross-validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Each parameter was trained and evaluated separately on the DL network. The mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) were used as evaluation indices, and the consistency between the predicted and actual values was analyzed using the Bland-Altman plot. The interpretability of the model's prediction process was analyzed using the Grad-CAM visualization technique.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 2408 subjects were included (average age 66 ± 12 years; 1479 males). Among these, 822 cases were used for encoder training to extract image features, and 1,586 cases were used for the development and validation of a multimodal feature fusion model based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The MAE, MSE, and r predicted between PFT and model estimates for FEV1 were 0.34, 0.20, and 0.84, respectively. For FVC, the MAE, MSE, and r were 0.42, 0.31, and 0.81, respectively. For FEV1/FVC, the MAE, MSE, and r were 6.64, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively. For FEV1%, the MAE, MSE, and r were 13.42, 3.01, and 0.73, respectively. For FVC%, the MAE, MSE, and r were 13.33, 2.97, and 0.61, respectively. It was observed that there was a strong correlation between the measured and predicted indices of FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and FEV1%. The Bland-Altman plot analysis showed good consistency between the estimated values and the measured values of all PFT parameters.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The preliminary research results indicate that the MLP-based multimodal feature fusion model has the potential to predict PFT parameters in COPD patients in real time. However, it is worth noting that the study used indicators before the use of bronchodilators, which may affect the interpretation of the results. Future studies should use measurements taken after bronchodilator administration to better align with clinical standards.",Li R; Guo H; Wu Q; Han J; Kang S,"The Fourth Clinical Medical College of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, 830000, Xinjiang, China.",BMC pulmonary medicine,2025-10-21,10.1186/s12890-025-03957-7,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Model; Pulmonary Function Tests; Chest Ct; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Mlp; Deep Learning
40845086,A Novel Application of Statewide Emergency Department Data to Classify Behavioral Health Holds.,"<h4>Context</h4>Emergency department (ED) ""boarding"" for behavioral health occurs when patients remain in emergency rooms overnight due to a lack of available psychiatric beds. However, quantification of the problem and demographic characterization of affected populations have been limited and manual. When a patient stays in the ED awaiting either an inpatient psychiatric bed or community care, this is known as a behavioral health hold (BHH). Understanding of BHH requires statewide, 'real-time' data collection that does not widely exist.<h4>Program</h4>Collaborators leveraged an existing syndromic surveillance system to compile ED data from across North Carolina into an executive BHH dashboard by developing a custom data extract, implementing a BHH case definition, and curating the data in a secure environment. Data come from 131 hospitals submitting ED visit data to NC DETECT, and the resulting extract includes patients with ED encounters lasting at least 24 hours for a behavioral health reason from November 2022 to November 2024.<h4>Implementation</h4>The team implemented and evaluated multiple case definitions of BHH based on ICD-10 codes or keywords listed within the free-text encounter chief complaint. One case definition and four metrics were selected for use within a dashboard based on subject matter expert feedback. US Census Bureau data were used to create population denominators and estimate population rates, which are presented in an equity context.<h4>Evaluation</h4>This dashboard enabled data-driven funding and policy decisions for additional crisis stabilization resources, including Facility Based Crisis (FBC) facilities, Behavioral Health Urgent Care (BHUC) facilities, and Mobile Response and Stabilization Services.<h4>Discussion</h4>A cross-departmental approach provided the necessary expertise for state departments of health to capitalize on an existing syndromic surveillance system to address a behavioral health policy need. This novel approach, encapsulated in a dashboard, places intelligence about the burden of BHH directly in the hands of policy makers.",Wheeler BS; Wheeler BS; Arellano AR; Bowman J; Brown CL; Deyneka L; Krause E; McCoy K; Young H; Tenenbaum JD,"Author Affiliations: North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Raleigh, North Carolina (Mr Wheeler, Ms Arellano, Ms Young, and Dr Tenenbaum); North Carolina Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, Raleigh, North Carolina (Ms Bowman, Dr Brown, Mr Krause, Dr McCoy); Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina (Dr Brown); North Carolina Division of Public Health, Raleigh, North Carolina (Dr Deyneka); and Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina (Dr Tenenbaum).",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,2025-10-21,10.1097/phh.0000000000002210,2.8,"dashboard(abstract); data(title,abstract)",Emergency Department; Behavioral Health; Syndromic Surveillance
41123341,A 1-year study on SARS-CoV-2 variant shifts in wastewater using dPCR: comparison with clinical and GISAID data.,"Wastewater testing can be used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infections in communities. Data from PCR-based wastewater testing are usually available to public health authorities within 5-7 days after excreta and other body fluids enter the sewer. While PCR-based methods can accurately detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2, sequencing-based methods are usually required to distinguish between variants, delaying the results and adding cost to the process. We developed and assessed a novel, customizable digital PCR (dPCR)-based genotyping method for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection in wastewater, which is more cost-effective, faster, and more accessible than sequencing. This approach was applied to more than 1,400 wastewater samples collected from six states between April 2023 and May 2024, with results displayed on a public dashboard alongside clinical data from the same period. The wastewater dPCR-based method effectively detected emerging variants, mirroring trends observed in clinical settings and in data on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform; this method also provided early warning signals, as variants like EG.5 and FL were identified in wastewater before clinical detection. A subset of the wastewater samples was analyzed using both dPCR genotyping and sequencing, with good agreement between the two methods. The range of concordance for four different variants was between 62% and 98%. The successful development and implementation of this dPCR-based genotyping for wastewater samples demonstrates its cost-effectiveness and scalability. With the decline in clinical testing, wastewater surveillance becomes increasingly vital for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants and supplementing clinical surveillance efforts.<h4>Importance</h4>As clinical specimens are collected and analyzed less for SARS-CoV-2, variant detection in wastewater provides a readily accessible and rich source of information on SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The detection of pathogen targets in wastewater samples using PCR assays is a sensitive, cost-effective way to monitor the levels of infectious diseases, like SARS-CoV-2, in a community. Unfortunately, because PCR-based methods are typically not used to distinguish between viral variants, most wastewater testing labs must rely on more expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive sequencing methods for these results. Building upon recent developments for variant detection using quantitative PCR, we developed and assessed a novel, customizable digital PCR-based genotyping method for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection in wastewater, which is more rapid, cost-effective, and accessible than sequencing. We characterize the method and offer insights for improvement in future implementations.",Mosavi SMR; Acer P; Andersen P; Barbero R; Barksdale S; Bellakbira S; Bunde D; Dunlap R; Erickson J; Goldfarb D; Jones-Roe T; Kilroy M; Le H; Lepene B; Milich E; Mohamed A; Munns D; Obermeyer J; Patnaik A; Pricer G; Reven MT; Richardson D; Ruhunusiri C; Sahoo SK; Saunders LP; Swahn O; Vengurlekar K; White D; Davis-Turak J; Stanz A; Flores-Baffi AP; Lozach J; Wesselman T; Hilton S; Kashwala S; Liu P; Moe CL; Sablon O; Wang Y; Wolfe M; Antkiewicz D; Camarato E; Janssen K; Roguet A; Shrestha S; Wied R; Gillespie J; Huang J; Jones A; Kane S; Gonzalez DS; Jarju ML; Lin C-Y; Pascual ME; Poretsky R; Secreto M; Bradley I; Gallo S; Ye Y; Donahue E; Greenwald SM; Owens S; Wilton R,"Ceres Nanosciences Inc., Manassas, Virginia, USA.",mSystems,2025-10-22,10.1128/msystems.00229-25,2.8,"dashboard(abstract); data(title,abstract)",Variants; Genotyping; Mutations; Digital Pcr (Dpcr); Whole-genome Sequencing (Wgs); Wastewater-based Epidemiology (Wbe); Sars-cov-2; Omicron
41128792,Three-dimensional heads-up pneumatic retinopexy with chandelier illumination for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in eyes with mild media opacity: a prospective case series.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To investigate a new technique for Pneumatic Retinopexy (PnR) using a 25G chandelier, cryotherapy, SF6 gas injection, and a heads-up 3D visualization system for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective consecutive case series included 20 eyes from 20 patients with RRD including 11 macula-on and 9 macula-off cases. The surgical technique combined endoillumination via a 25-gauge chandelier with three-dimensional heads-up visualization, cryotherapy, and pure SF<sub>6</sub> gas as an intraocular tamponade. All patients underwent a 12-month postoperative follow-up to assess primary retinal reattachment success and document any procedure-related complications.<h4>Results</h4>The mean operative time was 10.3 ± 2.4 min. Primary anatomical success defined as single-procedure retinal reattachment without additional surgery was achieved in 80% of eyes (16/20) at 12 months. Median time to recurrence was 14 days. Of the four eyes with recurrence, two underwent a second gas injection with cryotherapy, and two required pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade for new inferior breaks associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved significantly from 0.54 ± 0.34 to 0.32 ± 0.23 LogMAR at 12 months postoperatively (p < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>3D heads-up PnR with chandelier illumination is a feasible technique that offers subjectively enhanced intraoperative visualization compared with indirect ophthalmoscopy, particularly in eyes with mild media opacity.

However, applying universal models across multiple modalities remains challenging due to inherent inter-modality variability. Here we present the Modality Projection Universal Model (MPUM), trained on 861 subjects, which dynamically adapts to diverse imaging modalities through a modality-projection strategy. MPUM achieves state-of-the-art, whole-body organ segmentation, providing rapid localization for computer-aided diagnosis and precise anatomical quantification to support clinical decision-making. A controller-based convolutional layer further enables saliency map visualization, enhancing model interpretability for clinical use. Beyond segmentation, MPUM reveals metabolic correlations along the brain-body axis and between distinct brain regions, providing insights into systemic and physiological interactions from a whole-body perspective.

41114919,Integrated Network Analysis of Toxic Elements Co-exposure and Pathophysiological Changes Triggered by Oxidative Stress/Inflammation in Urban Sanitation Workers.,"This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiological changes of urban sanitation workers caused by potentially toxic element (PTE) exposure with a network analysis approach. Ninety urban sanitation workers from Bushehr Municipal Organization (exposed group) and 90 janitorial staff members from academic, administrative, and institutional settings (control group) were included. The PTE levels in serum samples were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 7500). Cytoscape software, version 3.10.3, was employed for network analysis and visualization. The concentration levels of PTEs in the exposed and control groups ranged from 0.65 (Co) to 1345 (Fe) and 0.23 (Cd) to 1287 (Fe) μg/L, respectively. The concentration levels of ∑PTEs in the exposed and control groups were 2986 ± 1655 and 2664 ± 1240 μg/L, respectively. The levels of some blood indices, such as white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HB), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), lymphocytes, and eosinophils, were statistically different between the exposed and control groups (p < 0.001). The direct and weighted network analysis to visualize interactions between PTEs and biomarkers showed that As, Cd, and Pb emerged as the most influential PTEs, affecting multiple biomarkers with robust connections. The network analysis showed that oxidative stress/inflammatory markers, particularly 8-OHdG and TNF-α, act as key triggers mediating the adverse effects of PTEs on liver function (ALT, AST) and other physiological systems.

Here, the study reports a magnetic microrobot platform (MMP) that integrates high-capacity drug loading, magnetically actuated collective navigation, controlled drug release, and real-time 3D optoacoustic imaging in a single system. The MMP exploits synergistic advantages by embedding hard-magnetic FePt nanoparticles in a degradable ZIF-8 shell, achieving a drug loading efficiency of ≈93.9% and enabling precise release in response to pH changes and radiofrequency-induced heating. Reconfigurable swarm behavior strategies significantly enhance the navigation efficiency of microrobots against physiological blood flows within complex cerebral vasculature. The ex vivo and in vivo experiments further demonstrate strong contrast characteristics of the microrobots, enabling high-resolution visualization of deep vascular structures and dynamic tracking of MMP with real-time 3D optoacoustic imaging.

41118624,"Effect of a Year-long Yoga-Based Lifestyle Intervention on Glycemic Control, Body Weight, Psychological Health, and Imaging Biomarkers in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.","<h4>Background</h4>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, adversely affecting the quality of life.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate a year-long yoga-based lifestyle intervention versus physical exercise and health education for glycemic control and comprehensive health outcomes in adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.<h4>Study design</h4>Two-arm, prospective, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group superiority design and a 1:1 allocation ratio.<h4>Participants</h4>160 adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (mean age 53.34±8.97 years; 84 males) were randomized to yoga-based lifestyle (n=80) or physical exercise and health education (n=80) groups.<h4>Intervention</h4>The yoga-based group received supervised yoga practice (1 hour/day, 5 days/week) for 4 weeks, followed by 11 months of tele-supervised practice with weekly yoga philosophy discussions. The physical exercise group received matched physical exercise and health education sessions. Assessments were performed at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year.<h4>Results</h4>Although both interventions significantly reduced glycated hemoglobin levels and waist-hip ratio at 12 months, the yoga-based group demonstrated superior glycated hemoglobin reduction compared to theexercise group at 6 months (mean estimated difference of 0.80 unit greater reduction) and 1 year (mean estimated difference of 1.25 unit greater reduction), corresponding to a 22.06% greater decrease in HbA1C levels over the course of 1 year.. The yoga-based group also showed significant improvements in postprandial glucose, depression scores, and body mass index at 1 year compared to the exercise group. The yoga-based group showed significant improvements in the energy balance of several organs, including overall balance, right and left organ balance, digestive system balance, adrenal balance, cerebral cortex balance, and stress reduction compared to the exercise group. Additionally, the yoga-based lifestyle group exhibited significantly reduced medication use scores at 12 months.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Yoga-based lifestyle interventions show superior efficacy over standard physical exercise programs for diabetes management, demonstrating improvements in glycemic control, psychological health, and novel biomarkers. These findings support integrating yoga interventions into comprehensive diabetes care, although further mechanistic studies are warranted.<h4>keywords</h4>yoga, type 2 diabetes mellitus, glycemic control, glycated hemoglobin, depression, postprandial plasma glucose, thermal imaging, gas discharge visualization.",Bhargav H; Bista S; Jasti N; Chikkanna U; Kumar V S; Kumar R K; Varmbally S; Srikanta S; Nagarathna R; Padmavati R; Kusneniwar G; Singh NK; Gangadhar BN; Manohar KN,"Associate Professor; Department of Integrative Medicine, National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India.",Advances in mind-body medicine,2025-10-22,,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41115289,Capacity to Invest Effort as a Predictor of Preference for Digital Mental Health Interventions Over Psychotherapy: Cross-Sectional Study Using an Ecological Digital Screening Tool.,"<h4>Background</h4>Research typically shows a higher preference for professionally led face-to-face mental health interventions over digital ones. It remains unclear in which circumstances digital self-help tools are preferred. To address this gap, it is important to examine user characteristics that may help predict when digital interventions are more desirable, ultimately guiding their design to enhance engagement and appeal.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to examine how distress severity and capacity to invest effort relate to intervention preferences, using an ecological assessment of individuals seeking to receive feedback on their mental health.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive digital mental health screening tool with automated feedback was developed and advertised on social media. The sample comprised 684 adult participants aged 18 to 82 years who opted to complete the screening to receive feedback on their mental health state. Participants completed questionnaires measuring general psychological distress, depression, generalized anxiety, and demographics. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6 was used as the primary measure for distress. Participants were also presented with questions measuring capacity to invest effort and preferences for a professional therapist versus digital self-help tools and for psychotherapy versus a mobile app. The effectiveness of distress, capacity to invest effort, and background characteristics in predicting preferences (a professional vs digital self-help tools; psychotherapy vs a mobile app) was examined using hierarchical linear regressions. The distributions of dichotomized preferences were plotted against distress and capacity to invest effort for transparent visualization.<h4>Results</h4>A hierarchical linear regression found that distress, capacity to invest, and currently being in psychotherapy significantly predicted preference for a professional versus digital self-help tools. Distress (β=.25, 95% CI .18-.32; P<.001) and capacity to invest effort (β=.23, 95% CI .16-.30; P<.001) were the strongest predictors, with similar effect size. The model explained 20% of the variance in preference, with the capacity to invest effort uniquely contributing 5%. Most participants experiencing distress with low capacity (158/239, 66.1%) preferred digital self-help tools, whereas most participants experiencing distress with high capacity (147/243, 60.5%) favored a professional. Similar results were obtained when using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 as an alternative distress measure. Capacity to invest effort remained significant (β=.18, 95% CI .10-.26; P<.001) when predicting a preference for psychotherapy versus a mobile app, while distress was not significant (β=-.03, 95% CI -.10 to .05; P=.51).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study highlights that the preference for digital interventions is driven by a reduced capacity to invest effort in an intervention. Attempts to reduce the mental health treatment gap through digital interventions should focus on optimizing the effort elicited by users to improve desirability and engagement.",Savir T; Baumel A,"Department of Community Mental Health, Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences, University of Haifa, Abba Khoushy Ave 199, Haifa, 3498838, Israel, 972 8288496 ext 4, 972 8288723.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-10-20,10.2196/77802,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Internet; Screening; Mental health; Effort; Distress; Preferences; Severity; Digital Health; Digital Interventions; Capacity To Invest
41130267,Sensing ultrasound localization microscopy for ultrastructural and functional imaging of neonatal kidneys.,"Sensing ultrasound localization microscopy (sULM) enables radiation-free imaging of microvascular architecture and blood flow dynamics by tracking intravasal microbubble contrast agents. This technical development aims to enable the visualization of glomeruli in the renal cortex of neonates serving as a potential imaging biopsy.This technical report describes the first use of sULM in the human neonatal kidney. Neonatal subjects were examined by transabdominal contrast-enhanced ultrasound using a standard clinical ultrasound device. An image-based motion correction algorithm was implemented and the filtering, localization, and tracking of microbubbles during sULM analysis were refined. sULM algorithms were applied next to depict fast- and slow-moving microbubbles separately and to identify glomeruli by distance metric calculations.Five neonates were investigated. Slow-moving microbubbles were detected mainly in the cortical region, travelling a typical route through a glomerulus. By calculating the cumulative movement of every microbubble, the number of glomeruli could be counted over the entire organ.We report an effective sULM workflow within the human neonate and the first microvascular sULM maps of neonatal renal vascularity up to the scale of a single glomerulus. The assessment of glomeruli as smallest functional units over the whole kidney has high potential to serve as a non-invasive imaging biomarker in future studies.",Grieshaber-Bouyer Mandelbaum H; Wachter F; Denis L; Reisinger C; Buehler A; Yan J; Hilger AC; Jobst-Schwan T; Hebert S; Morhart P; Jüngert J; Couture O; Schiffer M; Woelfle J; Reutter H; Knieling F; Hanslik G; Regensburger AP,"Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Erlangen University Hospital, Erlangen, Germany.","Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)",2025-10-23,10.1055/a-2700-9184,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41133348,MR Elastography-Based Slip Interface Imaging for Assessment of Myofascial Interface Mobility in Chronic Low Back Pain: A Pilot Study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Abnormal restrictions at myofascial interfaces are a key factor in chronic low back pain (CLBP) with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), but no established imaging method exists for quantitative assessment. This pilot study evaluated the clinical feasibility of MR elastography (MRE)-based slip interface imaging (SII) for visualizing myofascial mobility in CLBP-MPS patients versus age-/sex-/BMI-matched healthy participants. A new SII biomarker, maximal normalized displacement discontinuity ( Dnorm$$ {D}_{norm} $$ ), was introduced, and the previously developed normalized octahedral shear strain (NOSS) map was used for comparison. Preliminary assessments of vibration-frequency effects, repeatability, and group differences in inter-muscular mobility were conducted.<h4>Methods</h4>MRE was conducted at 30, 60, and 90 Hz to compare Dnorm$$ {D}_{norm} $$ with NOSS for visualizing inter-muscular slip interfaces at the quadratus lumborum-erector spinae (QL-ES) and erector spinae-multifidus (ES-M) muscle boundaries at L3-L4. Repeatability of Dnorm$$ {D}_{norm} $$ and NOSS was assessed at 30 Hz (identified as the best-performing frequency) using within-subject coefficients of variation and a linear mixed-effects model from within- and between-day scans. Clinical feasibility was then assessed via Wilcoxon rank-sum tests in six CLBP-MPS patients and matched controls.<h4>Results</h4>Dnorm$$ {D}_{norm} $$ at 30 Hz exhibited superior delineation of slip interfaces compared to higher frequencies and NOSS. Dnorm$$ {D}_{norm} $$ demonstrated significantly lower variation and better repeatability than NOSS. Healthy participants showed continuous, well-defined slip interfaces, whereas CLBP-MPS patients displayed disrupted interfaces with significant mobility reduction at L4 ES-M.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SII with lower vibration frequency and Dnorm$$ {D}_{norm} $$ map enhances visualization of lower back myofascial mobility and shows potential for assessing differences between healthy individuals and CLBP-MPS patients.",Hojo E; Sui Y; Shan X; Zheng K; Rossman P; Waters T; Manduca A; Powell GM; An KN; Ehman RL; Nanda S; Chon TY; Bauer BA; Yin Z,"Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.",Magnetic resonance in medicine,2025-10-24,10.1002/mrm.70158,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Muscle; Muscle Function; Mre; Slip Interface Imaging; Myofascial Tissue; Myofascial Mobility
41125853,The development and emerging trends in Parkinson's disease from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction: a bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace.,"<h4>Background</h4>Parkinson's disease (PD) is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Although diagnosis and management have improved, the global burden remains a significant concern. Currently, it is challenging to achieve effective treatment due to the gap in understanding the pathological cascade mechanism of PD. Converging clinical, genetic, and experimental evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, research progress and the systematic exploration of the remaining unknowns regarding mitochondrial dysfunction in PD are clarifying pathogenesis and guiding therapeutic strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>Using CiteSpace, we collected 5,040 publications on PD and mitochondrial dysfunction from Web of Science Core Collection. Visualization analysis based on betweenness centrality, count, and burst values aims to identify current research hotspots and predict emerging trends.<h4>Results</h4>Recent years have seen a significant increase in publications on PD and mitochondrial dysfunction. Current research hotspots focus on ""oxidative stress,"" ""alpha-synuclein,"" ""rotenone,"" ""PINK1/Parkin pathway,"" ""complex I,"" and various neurodegenerative diseases. Analysis predicts ""NLRP3 inflammasome,"" ""cognitive impairment,"" ""gut microbiota,"" and ""insulin resistance"" as potential future research frontiers. Multidimensional pathway exploration is crucial for comprehensively understanding PD pathogenesis, with mitochondrial dysfunction serving as a central hub that represents a key future therapeutic target.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The multipathology of PD creates synergistic therapeutic opportunities, particularly through mitochondria-focused approaches that modulate core disease mechanisms. On this basis, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis is a fundamental path forward, moving beyond protection to actively restore mitochondrial networks and promote neuronal recovery. These findings help comprehend PD's complex pathogenesis and guide precision therapeutic strategies.",Lu Y; Chen X; Lai Y,"School of Medical and Life Sciences, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.",Journal of neurology,2025-10-22,10.1007/s00415-025-13472-8,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Neurodegenerative disease; Parkinson’s Disease; Mitochondrial Dysfunction; Bibliometric Analysis; Citespace
41129406,Quantitative Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Amino Acids Enabled by Pyridinium Salt MALDI Probe.,"Amino acids (AAs) are closely linked to various diseases. Investigating their spatial distribution and content differences can provide deeper insights into specific disease mechanisms. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) enables spatial visualization of biomolecules, but conventional matrices introduce significant background interference that limits the detection of small molecules such as AAs. On-tissue chemical derivatization (OTCD) using permanently charged pyridinium probes significantly enhances the detection sensitivity of poorly ionizable compounds like AAs, allowing for their spatial mapping. However, current quantitative mass spectrometry imaging (QMSI) strategies for AAs using conventional matrix remain limited, highlighting the urgent need for the development of a widely applicable absolute quantification method for AAs that integrates OTCD. In this study, a series of pyridinium salt-based MALDI-MS probes were designed and characterized, leading to the identification of an efficient candidate, 1-(4-(((2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)oxy)carbonyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2,4,6-triphenylpyridin-1-ium tetrafluoroborate (DCMT-4FB). This probe was then combined with deuterium-labeled internal standard to establish calibration curve, and its linear correction capability was validated, demonstrating strong correlation coefficients. Furthermore, a novel quantitative endogenous substance spraying approach was employed to perform absolute quantification MSI analysis of AAs (leucine and isoleucine) in different regions of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue sections. Finally, by cospraying the DCMT-4FB probe with its deuterium-labeled isotope analog, DCMT-<i>d</i><sub>2</sub>-4FB, the spatial distribution of AAs and other metabolites within HCC tissues was rapidly obtained, providing valuable insights for clinical research. This study highlights the superior AAs quantification capability of the DCMT-4FB probe and offers new perspectives for probe development and quantitative analysis of endogenous metabolites.",Zhou H; Yuan J; Xu J; Wang Y; Ye J; Wang S; Wan Z; Pei W; Peng Y; Ye Y; Wang K; Liu J; Zheng J,"Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, P.

41117823,Optimizing whole-body MRI for early cancer detection in Li-Fraumeni syndrome: a prospective bicentric study.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Annual whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is recommended for early cancer detection in individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). However, there is no agreement on a standardized MRI protocol. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of different MRI sequences to suggest an optimized protocol for LFS surveillance.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this prospective bicentric study, 113 participants with LFS underwent annual WB-MRI and were included in the analysis. The protocol comprised turbo-spin echo (TSE) T1-weighted and inversion-recovery T2-weighted (TIRM) images of the whole body in coronal orientation, and T2-weighted (HASTE), diffusion-weighted (DWI), and T1-weighted DIXON images (pre- and post-contrast agent administration) from head to thighs in axial orientation. An additional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence imaged the skull only. Initial clinical interpretation was conducted by staff radiologists. The visibility of reported mass lesions was independently graded in all sequences by three experienced radiologists using a Likert scale. Sequence combinations were compared to inform the design of an optimal MRI protocol.<h4>Results</h4>Over 30 months, 189 WB-MRI examinations were performed in 113 participants (mean age 40 years, ±12.7 years [standard deviation], 91 women). 188 mass lesions were detected and confirmed as malignant (n = 38), benign (n = 120) or ambiguous (n = 30). In the multi-reader analysis, all new malignant lesions could have been detected by a combination of cranial FLAIR, whole-body DWI, and whole-body HASTE in the axial direction.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A shortened, contrast-agent-free WB-MRI protocol combining cranial FLAIR, WB-HASTE, and WB-DWI promises to be an effective and patient-friendly approach for annual cancer surveillance in LFS.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Annual whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is recommended for early cancer detection for individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), but a standardized sequence protocol has yet to be established. Findings The combination of cranial FLAIR, whole-body HASTE, and whole-body DWI in the axial plane enabled visualization of all newly developed malignant lesions in our study cohort. Clinical relevance A shortened, standardized WB-MRI protocol enables efficient, sensitive early cancer detection in individuals with LFS, minimizing patient burden by reducing examination time and contrast agent use.

40360182,Reporting the Degree of Certainty of CSF-Venous Fistulas in Patients with Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension: The Duke CSF-Venous Fistula Confidence Score.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs) are a common cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). CVF identification and localization are critical for diagnosis and treatment, but inconsistent visualization of CVFs on myelography leads to diagnostic uncertainty. Diagnostic confidence impacts treatment decisions. However, there is currently no standardized method for reporting the degree of confidence about the presence or absence of a CVF on CT myelography (CTM). The purposes of this study are to present a novel instrument to provide structured communication of the degree of certainty about the presence of a CVF and to determine the interreader and intrareader agreement of this scoring system for determining the presence of a CVF at a given spinal level on CTMs.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective study assessed the interreader and intrareader reproducibility of a scoring system anchored in previously reported objective imaging findings, including the attenuation of paraspinal veins associated with CVFs. We included CTMs from patients with SIH performed between 10/2017-03/2024 at 1 institution. Exclusion criteria were CSF leak other than CVF, prior transvenous embolization, and nondiagnostic CTMs. Several potential iterations of the scoring system were developed. The study cohort consisted of a balanced set of cases representative of varying degrees of certainty: definite, high probability, low probability, and negative (25 each). Five radiologists (3-19 years of experience) provided their blinded subjective confidence assessment and then applied the scoring system. Interreader and intrareader agreements were calculated for the different scoring system models using kappa statistics.<h4>Results</h4>The best-performing model produced substantial mean intrareader agreement, closely approximated the number of definite CVFs, and was adopted as the final model. Interreader agreement for the adopted model was moderate, replicating that for the subjective interpretations. Other versions of the model produced fair-to-moderate interreader agreements and were not adopted.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a structured reporting system anchored in objective imaging findings that communicates the degree of certainty about the presence of CVF on CTM. This system replicates assessments by expert readers and meets a critical need for improved communication both in daily clinical practice and in research by providing a method for objectively quantifying the certainty of CVF diagnosis.",Amrhein TJ; Zhu D; Gray L; Kilpatrick KW; Erkanli A; Willhite J; Malinzak MD; Kranz PG,"From the Department of Radiology (T.J.A., L.G., J.W., M.D.M., P.G.K.), Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina timothy.amrhein@duke.edu.",AJNR.

41117423,Dyna three-dimensional imaging enables reliable evaluation of neointimal formation after flow diverter treatment.,"BackgroundFlow diverter stent (FDS) treatment is an effective option for wide-necked intracranial aneurysms, but adequate neointimal formation and stent apposition are critical to prevent thromboembolic complications. Non-invasive, reliable imaging techniques for assessing neointimal formation remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of Dyna-3D imaging in assessing neointimal formation after FDS treatment and to compare its performance with conventional 2D-DSA.MethodsThis retrospective study included 61 patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with FDS between August 2019 and October 2024. Radiological follow-up was performed 3-6 months post-procedure using both 2D-DSA and Dyna-3D imaging. Neointimal coverage was classified into Groups A-C based on the positional relationship between the stent wires and the vessel wall (Group A = wire outside; Group B = partial overlap; Group C = the vessel wall outside). Interobserver agreement, imaging accuracy, and associated clinical factors were analyzed.ResultsComplete neointimal formation (Group A) was identified in 51 cases (83.6%; 95% CI 72.4-90.8) using Dyna-3D and 21 cases (34.4%; 95% CI 23.7-47.0) using 2D-DSA (<i>P</i> < .0001). Dyna-3D demonstrated superior interobserver agreement (Cohen's <i>κ</i>=0.893; 95% CI 0.75-1.00) compared to 2D-DSA (<i>κ</i>=0.459; 95% CI 0.28-0.64) in the evaluation of neointimal formation. Multivariate analysis identified younger age as a significant factor associated with Group A classification across both modalities (2D-DSA: OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, <i>P</i> = .008; Dyna-3D: OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.8-0.97, <i>P</i> = .018). No thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications were identified during follow-up.ConclusionDyna-3D imaging provides superior visualization of neointimal formation compared to conventional 2D-DSA and enables comprehensive circumferential assessment of stent apposition. These findings suggest that Dyna-3D may offer a useful tool for guiding post-FDS treatment management, including the potential for age-adjusted optimization of antiplatelet therapy duration.",Kotsugi M; Nakagawa I; Okamoto T; Hayami H; Nakase K; Yokoyama S; Matsuda R; Yamada S,"Department of Neurosurgery, Nara Medical University, Nara, Japan.","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",2025-10-21,10.1177/15910199251389066,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Neointimal Formation; Thromboembolic Complications; Flow Diverter Stent; 3D-reconstruction Imaging
41115186,Use of Gamified Digital Tools in Daily Tasks of Health Care Workers: Scoping Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>The quality and effectiveness of health care service delivery are significantly influenced by the engagement and motivation of health care workers. Integrating gamified digital tools (GDTs) into health care workers' workflows presents a promising approach to enhancing them. However, there is currently a lack of evidence supporting the implementation of such interventions.<h4>Objective</h4>This scoping review aims to summarize existing evidence on the influence of GDTs on the daily tasks of health care workers.<h4>Methods</h4>A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines for scoping reviews. We conducted a comprehensive search across different databases (PubMed, EMBASE, International Journal of Serious Games, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) for peer-reviewed studies and (OpenAlex, GreyNet, and IEEE Xplore) for gray literature published between January 2010 and January 2024. Eligibility criteria, developed using the SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, and Research) framework, included qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies involving health care workers using GDTs for daily tasks. Studies in English, French, Spanish, or Italian were eligible. Keywords and medical subject headings related to gamification and health care workers were used. The studies were screened, eligibility was assessed, and data were extracted. A narrative synthesis was used to summarize and interpret the findings.<h4>Results</h4>Of 5844 studies, 12 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. These studies exhibited considerable heterogeneity in the application of gamification. Feedback, competition, and dashboard features were the most common gamification elements identified. The implementation of these elements led to enhanced engagement, increased motivation, improved task completion, and promoted healthy competition among staff across various health care settings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Integrating GDTs into health care workers' tasks holds significant potential to enhance engagement and motivation. However, empirical evidence is still lacking. Comparative studies are needed to gain comprehensive insights into the benefits and limitations of gamification in health care.",Paudel B; Al-Shehabi H; Dörner R; El Bcheraoui C; Lennemann T; Bernasconi A,"Evidence-Based Public Health Unit, Centre for International Health Protection, Robert Koch Institute, Gricht Strasse 27, Berlin, 13347, Germany, +4930187545067.",JMIR serious games,2025-10-20,10.2196/70480,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Health care workers; Gamification; Game Elements; Gamified Digital Tools
41124187,Simulating the impact of methadone prescribing and pharmacy dispensing on opioid treatment and overdose in New York State: A study protocol for an agent-based modeling study.,"Amid the ongoing overdose crisis, U.S. lawmakers are considering policy reforms that could significantly change availability and accessibility of methadone treatment (MT) for opioid use disorder (OUD). However, uncertainty remains about which potential changes will lead to the greatest health benefits while minimizing unintended harms. In this protocol, we describe a planned NIH-funded study (R21DA061660) to simulate alternative MT delivery scenarios currently being considered in U.S. policy discussions, and estimate their impact on population-level rates of treatment initiation and retention and opioid overdose across different sociodemographic groups. We will use an agent-based model focused on 16 counties in NY State to simulate two alternative policy scenarios compared to the current status quo of opioid-treatment program (OTP) delivered MT: 1) office-based prescribing by addiction-certified providers with pharmacy and OTP dispensing; and 2) office-based prescribing by general practitioners with pharmacy and OTP dispensing. Agents will represent individuals with OUD and we will simulate access to MT based on alternative policy scenarios (e.g., locations of existing OTPs vs. provider offices and pharmacies). Probabilities of treatment initiation, retention, and opioid overdose will be informed by estimates from the scientific literature and administrative datasets from NY State. Multiple implementation scenarios will be considered to account for potential variation in adoption of office-based methadone by patients, providers, and pharmacies. To ensure relevance to directly impacted communities and policy makers, the study involves a collaboration between academic researchers and NY State government partners and relies on input from an Expert Advisory Board of people with lived and living experience with methadone, addiction medicine, and policy experts. Findings will be disseminated via a public dashboard. This study will inform ongoing policy discussions and shed light on the potential of researcher-policy partnerships to promote evidence-based policies that can reduce overdose and improve population health.",Krawczyk N; Miller M; Bórquez I; Rutherford C; Bobashev G; Mund P; Keyes K; Cerdá M; Jordan AE,"Center for Opioid Epidemiology and Policy, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.",PloS one,2025-10-22,10.1371/journal.pone.0335123,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),
