41087480,"Development, validation and visualization of risk prediction model for postoperative shivering in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy: a real-world retrospective study.","To develop, validate, and visualize a risk prediction model for postoperative shivering in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy, addressing the lack of individualized tools for this high-risk population. This retrospective study analyzed 530 patients undergoing VATS lobectomy from a tertiary hospital in Wuhan (January 2022-December 2023). The data were randomly divided into training set and validation set at a ratio of 7∶3. Patients were stratified into postoperative shivering (n = 198) and non-postoperative shivering (n = 332) groups based on Bedside Shivering Assessment Scale (BSAS) criteria. Logistic regression identified independent risk factors, and a nomograph was developed. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and decision curve analysis (DCA). An online visualization tool was created for clinical implementation. Postoperative shivering occurred in 198 of 530 patients undergoing VATS lobectomy (37.36%). The logistic regression analysis identified age < 60 years, intraoperative hypothermia, delayed anesthesia recovery, absence of postoperative analgesia, operation duration > 180 min and lower preoperative temperature as significant risk factors for postoperative shivering (P < 0.05). The resulting nomograph demonstrated strong discrimination with AUCs of 0.847 (95%CI: 0.809-0.885) in the training cohort (n = 424) and 0.836 (95%CI: 0.747-0.925) in validation (n = 106), while calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (χ<sup>2</sup> = 13.123, P = 0.108) confirmed model reliability. DCA demonstrated clinical utility across threshold probabilities of 0.20-0.98. In order to promote clinical implementation, deployment of the visualization tools online ( https://shivering.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/ ), which supports dynamic risk assessment. This study established the first risk prediction model for postoperative shivering in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy, integrating six perioperative variables into a clinically applicable nomograph and online tool. The model facilitates identification of high-risk patients, enabling targeted interventions to mitigate shivering-related complications.",Xia F; Li Q; Cheng Z; Yan Q; Hu J; Liu J; Li G; Chen R; Zhang J; Li J,"Department of Operating Room, Tongji Medical College, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430014, Hubei, China.",Scientific reports,2025-10-14,10.1038/s41598-025-19879-7,12.0,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Prediction model; risk factors; Postoperative Shivering; Visualization Tool; Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy
41090916,Impact of Mixed Reality on Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysm Clipping: Initial Experience With 25 Cases.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Middle cerebral artery (MCA) intracranial aneurysms (IAs) present in different anatomic configurations and variations, making their precise preoperative study of paramount importance to tailor treatment. Surgical planning with a 3-dimensional interactive technology such as mixed reality (MxR) may have a relevant impact on anatomic understanding and surgical orientation.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-five unruptured elective MCA IAs surgically prepared with MxR were prospectively included and matched with a cohort of 25 cases that were not prepared with MxR. Demographic, clinical, and aneurysm-related and surgery-related data were collected. Hologram preparation time (HPT) was recorded. The surgical preparation time, ie, from beginning of patient positioning to end of draping, and intraoperative time, ie, from skin incision to skin closure were compared between groups. MxR usability was evaluated through a standard Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of use questionnaire assessing Usefulness, Ease of Use, Ease of Learning, and Satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>The mean HPT was 26 ± 10 minutes. In 2 cases (8%), surgical planning with MxR led to the modification of the approach or the head's positioning. The cohort prepared with MxR showed a lower mean surgical time from skin incision to skin closure (203 ± 64 minutes vs 229 ± 78 minutes, 95% CI [-20, 58]). The mean craniotomy diameter and mean surgical preparation time did not differ significantly. Mean scores for Usefulness, Ease of Use, Ease of Learning, and Satisfaction were equal or above 5 for 80% of the interviewed surgeons, and a subjective feeling of improved anatomic understanding after 3-dimensional visualization was reported by all interviewed neurosurgeons.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The application of MxR on surgical planning of elective clipping of MCA IAs seemed to have relevant impact on surgical time and preoperative anatomic understanding while showing acceptable usability. HPT was significant and should be further reduced to be applicable broadly and preferably using automatic segmentation strategies.",Colombo E; Esposito G; Fierstra J; Germans MR; Serra C; Regli L; van Doormaal T,"Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Neuroscience Center, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.","Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2025-10-15,10.1227/ons.0000000000001807,8.0,"visualization(kw,abstract); visual(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Middle cerebral artery; Clipping; Intracranial aneurysm; 3d Visualization; Surgical Planning; Mca; Mixed Reality
41088036,Prediction model for depression risk in middle-aged and elderly patients with metabolic syndrome: a nomogram and interpretable machine learning approach based on CHARLS.,"<h4>Background</h4>Individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) are more prone to depression, which is a significant complication impacting quality of life. This research seeks to create and validate predictive models for assessing depression risk in patients with MetS.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from the 2011 (baseline) and 2015 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were employed in this study. By excluding variables with more than 20% missing values, 38 features, such as demographic information, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, health status indicators, and blood test information, were included. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) identified 11 key contributors, and 6 machine learning (ML) models were employed to determine the best depression risk in patients with MetS. Furthermore, the 2015 CHARLS data were included as a temporal validation cohort.<h4>Results</h4>In the 2011 CHARLS data, 5204 patients with MetS were analyzed, of whom 2543 (48.6%) exhibiting depression as indicated by a CESD-10 score of 10 or higher. 11 factors were selected to develop six ML models. The logistic regression (LR) (AUC: 0.749, 95% CI: 0.725-0.773) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) (AUC: 0.749, 95% CI: 0.725-0.773) models showed the same predictive ability in the test set. Utilizing grid search optimization, the XGBoost model attained an AUC of 0.737 (95% CI: 0.714-0.760) on the validation set.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The nomogram and SHAP visualization provide reliable tools for predicting depression in patients with MetS.

41087282,A Novel Machine Learning-Driven Voice and Clinical Biomarkers Framework for Robust Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To develop and validate a multimodal, machine learning-based framework that integrates acoustic voice features with baseline clinical parameters for noninvasive and accurate screening of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We analyzed data from 3129 individuals, including 1158 with T2DM and 1971 without. Voice recordings were collected under standardized conditions and processed with the openSMILE toolkit to extract 88 acoustic features, encompassing prosodic, spectral, cepstral, and quality-related parameters. In parallel, 30 clinical features were obtained from demographic, anthropometric, biochemical, lifestyle, and medical history variables. After preprocessing and imputation, feature selection was conducted using LASSO, ANOVA, Mutual Information, and Recursive Feature Elimination. Dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis was also evaluated. Models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, TabNet, and TabTransformer, were trained with cross-validation and tuned through grid and randomized searches. Performance was assessed on an independent test set using accuracy, recall, and area under the curve (AUC). Model interpretability was addressed via SHAP analysis, t-SNE visualization, and radar plots. Clinical utility was assessed with nomogram construction, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>Models using clinical features alone achieved moderate performance (AUC ≈ 69%). Acoustic-only models performed better, with the LASSO + XGBoost combination reaching an AUC of 80.8%. The fused feature set markedly outperformed both unimodal approaches, with the LASSO + XGBoost model achieving 94.1% accuracy, 93.6% recall, and an AUC of 95.2%. SHAP analysis identified HbA1c, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and acoustic markers such as jitter and shimmer as top predictors. Calibration plots showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed probabilities, while DCA demonstrated superior net clinical benefit.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our multimodal framework provides an accurate, interpretable, and clinically actionable approach for noninvasive T2DM screening.

41074697,The role of enhanced stent visualization imaging in percutaneous coronary intervention: a systematic review of efficacy and clinical outcomes.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is central to its management, and optimal stent deployment is critical. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and clinical outcomes associated with enhanced stent visualization (ESV) systems - X-ray-based fluoroscopic tools such as StentBoost and CLEARstent - in PCI.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search of PubMed, PubMed Central, and Cochrane Library was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria comprised all study types evaluating ESV use in PCI, excluding case reports and non-English articles. Study quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa tool.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve studies involving ESV were included. ESV improved detection of stent expansion and deployment versus standard angiography and showed strong agreement with OCT and IVUS. ESV-guided PCI was associated with reduced rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), particularly in long-term follow-up. Radiation exposure was modestly increased but deemed acceptable.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ESV systems enhance stent deployment accuracy and clinical outcomes in PCI, offering a cost-effective and accessible alternative to OCT and IVUS. Evidence supports routine integration of ESV in PCI workflows, although further large-scale trials are warranted.<h4>Registration</h4>PROSPERO identifier is CRD420251020834.",Sant Bakshsingh V; Bundhoo SS; Protty MB,"Department of Cardiology, Grange University Hospital, Cwmbran, UK.",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,2025-10-14,10.1080/14779072.2025.2574262,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Coronary angiography; Percutaneous coronary intervention; coronary artery disease; Fluoroscopy; Stentboost; Stent Boost; Clearstent; Clear Stent

41085928,Ultrasound-Based Tomographic Imaging Reconstruction and Synthesis Methods: a Scoping Review.,"Ultrasound (US) imaging is valued for its safety, affordability, and accessibility, but its low spatial resolution and operator dependence limit its diagnostic capabilities. Tomographic imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer high-resolution 3D visualization but are cost-prohibitive and complex. Ultrasound-based tomographic imaging aims to combine the advantages of both modalities, potentially democratizing access to advanced imaging. A scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-SR guidelines. Articles were identified through searches in PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and arXiv from inception to July 2025. Eligibility criteria included full-text original studies focused on ultrasound-based tomographic imaging generation or reconstruction methods. Out of 8256 identified articles, 86 met the inclusion criteria. Studies examined four imaging modalities: photoacoustic tomography (36%), ultrasound computed tomography (36%), 3D reconstruction (20%), and synthetic imaging (7%). Deep learning algorithms (67%) were the most common, followed by iterative reconstruction algorithms (9%), and other methods. The breast (17%), brain (16%), and blood vessels (14%) were the most studied anatomical regions. This review highlights advancements in ultrasound-based tomographic imaging, driven by deep learning innovations. Despite progress, the field is still in its infancy, and challenges remain in clinical adoption, particularly in standardization and validating performance.

41085786,Introducing autofluorescence technology for inguinal nerve visualization in open anterior hernia surgery: a step forward in surgical precision and safety.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Injury to inguinal nerves remains a leading cause of chronic postoperative pain following anterior inguinal hernia repair. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of intraoperative neural autofluorescence using near-ultraviolet (NUV) imaging for real time identification of target nerves during open Lichtenstein hernioplasty and to assess its potential to reduce neuropathic complications.<h4>Methods</h4>Five male patients with primary inguinal hernias and varying clinical profiles underwent open hernia repair with the adjunct use of NUV autofluorescence to enhance intraoperative nerve mapping. Operative time, intraoperative nerve visualization, and early postoperative outcomes were recorded. Patients were followed for sensory deficits, functional limitations, and chronic pain over 12 months.<h4>Results</h4>Neural autofluorescence enabled consistent and unambiguous identification of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric and genitofemoral nerves-including both genital and femoral branches-in all cases. The additional time required for nerve mapping was negligible. No intraoperative complications, postoperative morbidities, or readmissions were reported. At one-year follow-up, all patients were free from chronic groin pain, sensory compromise, or functional limitations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Intraoperative neural autofluorescence is a safe and technically feasible adjunct during open Lichtenstein repair, allowing for reliable nerve identification without altering surgical workflow. These preliminary findings suggest a potential role in reducing the risk of iatrogenic nerve injury and postoperative neuropathic pain. Further evaluation in larger, controlled studies is warranted to define its value in routine hernia surgery.",Harraca J; Aleman R; Schor M; Melgar JI; Marozzi F; Eichman S,"Department of General Surgery, Rosario Private Hospital, Rosario, Argentina.

41081880,Development and validation of a nomogram combining PI-RADS v2.1 and clinical indicators for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients with PSA ≤ 20 ng/mL.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This investigation focused on developing a predictive clinical tool that combines biparametric MRI-derived PI-RADS v2.1 assessments with patient-specific biomarkers. The model was designed to optimize prostate cancer detection reliability in individuals exhibiting prostate-specific antigen concentrations below 20 ng/mL, particularly targeting the diagnostic challenges presented by this intermediate PSA range. By systematically integrating imaging characteristics with laboratory parameters, the research sought to establish a practical decision-making framework for clinicians managing suspected prostate malignancies.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 218 patients with confirmed pathological diagnoses between January 2020 and December 2023 underwent a retrospective review. The cohort was divided into two distinct groups: a training cohort comprising 153 cases and a validation cohort containing 65 cases. For nomogram predictor selection, statistical modeling incorporated machine learning approaches including LASSO regression with ten-fold cross-validation, supplemented by both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify independent prognostic factors.The nomogram's predictive performance was evaluated by determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), developing calibration plots, and implementing decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>The study findings revealed that among patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations ≤ 20 ng/mL, four parameters - PI-RADS v2.1 classification, free PSA ratio (%fPSA), diffusion-weighted imaging-derived ADC values, and serum hemoglobin concentrations - emerged as independent predictive factors for prostate carcinoma detection. The composite predictive model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to individual parameters, achieving an elevated receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.922. Notably, the PI-RADS v2.1 scoring system alone showed an AUC of 0.848 (P < 0.05) in this patient cohort. The area under the curve (AUC) for free PSA percentage reached 0.760 (P < 0.001), while apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values showed superior discriminative ability with an AUC of 0.825 (P < 0.001). Hemoglobin levels exhibited moderate predictive value (AUC = 0.622, P = 0.006). The developed predictive model exhibited outstanding diagnostic accuracy, achieving AUC scores of 0.922 in the training dataset and 0.898 in the validation cohort, complemented by precise calibration metrics. Integrating PI-RADS v2.1 scores with clinical parameters enhanced diagnostic performance, yielding 81.2% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity in lesion characterization.This marked improvement becomes evident when compared to the standalone application of PI-RADS v2.1, which yielded sensitivity and specificity values of 73.2% and 86.8% correspondingly.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The PI-RADS v2.1 assessment derived from biparametric MRI demonstrates standalone prognostic value for detecting prostate malignancies in patients with serum PSA concentrations below 20 ng/mL. This imaging-based scoring system, when integrated with additional clinical parameters, significantly enhances the diagnostic reliability of clinical assessments. The methodology provides clinicians with a non-invasive evaluation tool featuring intuitive visualization capabilities, potentially reducing the necessity for invasive biopsy procedures while maintaining diagnostic precision. This integrated methodology demonstrates considerable promise as an effective framework for improving diagnostic accuracy in PCa identification and supporting therapeutic choices in clinical practice.",Su Z; Cai B; Li L; Huang Z; Fu Y,"The People's Hospital of Pingyang, Wenzhou, China. suzhilian82@163.com.",Abdominal radiology (New York),2025-10-13,10.1007/s00261-025-05231-0,5.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); machine learning(abstract); data(kw,abstract)",prostate specific antigen; prostate cancer; Nomogram; Prostate Imaging Reporting And Data System (Pi-rads)

41091041,Wheelchair user and clinician-centered design of a mobile pressure mapping app and dashboard: A pre-implementation development study.,"<h4>Context/objective</h4>The purpose of this project was to expand the functionality of current seat interface pressure mapping (IPM) toward a novel integrated system that uses a mobile IPM application for wheelchair users partnered with a clinical IPM dashboard.<h4>Methods</h4>Guided by user-centered design, this mixed methods study aimed to understand and integrate user needs and preferences across three iterations of development with two stakeholder groups: (1) occupational and physical therapy (OT/PT) experts in spinal cord injury and disorder (SCI/D) care (n = 6) and (2) Veteran wheelchair users (WCUs) with SCI/D (n = 7). At each iterative stage, rapid qualitative analysis was used to summarize feedback and design inputs. Perception of usability was evaluated with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and User-Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). OT/PT feature preferences were assessed through polling during first focus group.<h4>Results</h4>Iteration I resulted in wireframes and models of designs for an IPM dashboard, mounting system for mobile IPM system, and smartwatch display options. Iteration II resulted in prototypes of an IPM dashboard, initial redesign of the mobile IPM app to include all-day IPM recording, automatic detection of pressure relief events and smartwatch functionality, and new hardware for IPM interface box. The final integrated IPM system was completed during Iteration III. OT/PTs indicated that aggregated and filtered views of IPM data could enhance patient communication, decision-making, and individualization of pressure management goals. Interface simplicity and automation minimize time and effort engaging with the system. Both stakeholder groups desired maximum control, flexibility, and efficiency in how they collect, access, and use the resulting IPM data. WCUs prefer a range of options for hardware access and use. SUS and UEQ scores were good to excellent across all subscales after three iterative rounds and both groups provided subjective approval of final products.<h4>Conclusions</h4>OT/PTs and WCUs with SCI/D perceived positive relative value and usability for using the newly integrated IPM system to objectively measure pressure and patterns of pressure management on the seating surface over time, evaluate seating equipment efficacy, and facilitate individualized care for managing pressure.

Two 5-mm laparoscopic ports were placed via ventral midline incisions. An 8.5-French pigtail catheter was introduced percutaneously into the gallbladder lumen under laparoscopic guidance. Iohexol contrast medium, diluted in 3 different ratios, was injected, and fluoroscopic images were obtained using a C-arm fluoroscopy unit. Catheters were removed, and gallbladder walls were closed with intracorporeal suturing. Visibility of the cystic duct, hepatic ducts, and common bile duct was graded from excellent to not visible.<h4>Results</h4>Catheter placement was successful in all cadavers. Contrast leakage occurred in 4 cadavers. The common bile duct was graded excellent to good in 7 cadavers and not visible in 1, the cystic duct was excellent to good in 8, and the hepatic ducts were excellent to good in 6 and not visible in 2. The 1:2 iohexol dilution provided optimal visualization in this study. Catheter sites were successfully closed with intracorporeal suturing without observed bile leakage.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Laparoscopic-assisted fluoroscopic cholangiography is a feasible technique for biliary visualization in canine cadavers, particularly with a 1:2 iohexol dilution.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>This technique may provide a minimally invasive method for intraoperative biliary assessment in dogs, facilitating identification of anatomy and guidance of surgical procedures. Further studies in live patients are warranted to evaluate safety, effectiveness, and applicability in clinical cases.",Azuma K; Ohlendorf A; Shropshire S; Monnet E,,American journal of veterinary research,2025-10-15,10.2460/ajvr.25.08.0286,4.1,"visualization(abstract); visual(title,abstract)",Dog; Cadaver; laparoscopy; Fluoroscopy; Cholangiography
41099819,[In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy and keratinocyte skin cancer : Reflectance confocal microscopy and artificial intelligence].,"<h4>Background</h4>Keratinocyte skin cancers (KC), including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and the spectrum of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), represent the most common malignancies worldwide. Accurate diagnosis and margin assessment are critical for optimal treatment but remain challenging when relying solely on clinical and dermoscopic evaluation. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) offers high-resolution, noninvasive imaging of skin architecture at near-histological levels, potentially improving diagnostic precision and reducing the need for (re)biopsies.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the current diagnostic criteria, diagnostic utility, advantages, and limitations of confocal microscopy in the assessment of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC).<h4>Methods</h4>A narrative review of recent literature and current guidelines was conducted, focusing on RCM for the detection, characterization, and monitoring of BCC and KC. Key diagnostic criteria, imaging protocols, and clinical applications were analyzed, including preoperative mapping, differentiation from benign lesions, and follow-up after treatment.<h4>Results</h4>RCM provides real-time visualization of tumor architecture, cellular morphology, and vascular patterns, facilitating the identification of hallmark features such as basaloid tumor islands in BCC and keratinocyte atypia in SCC. Studies report improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced rates of unnecessary excisions. Limitations include restricted imaging depth and the requirement for operator expertise.<h4>Conclusion</h4>RCM represents a powerful adjunct to conventional diagnostic methods for NMSC. Its ability to deliver high-resolution, noninvasive imaging enhances diagnostic confidence, supports surgical planning, and aids in treatment monitoring, ultimately improving patient care. Combining multiple noninvasive techniques with proper training is key to enhancing this approach and promoting its routine clinical use.",Ruini C,"Klinik für Dermatologie und Allergologie, Klinikum der Universität München, Frauenlobstr. 9-11, 80337, München, Deutschland. cristel.ruini@delc.ch.","Dermatologie (Heidelberg, Germany)",2025-10-16,10.1007/s00105-025-05586-x,4.1,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(title),Basal Cell Carcinoma; Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer; Margins Of Excision; Skin Imaging; Keratinocyte Neoplasms
41094481,BayesianFitForecast: a user-friendly R toolbox for parameter estimation and forecasting with ordinary differential equations.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are essential tools across various scientific disciplines, including biology, ecology, epidemic modeling, and healthcare informatics, where they are used to simulate complex dynamic systems and inform decision-making. However, implementing Bayesian calibration and forecasting typically requires substantial coding in Stan or similar tools. To support Bayesian parameter estimation and forecasting for such systems, we introduce BayesianFitForecast, a user-friendly R toolbox specifically developed to streamline Bayesian parameter estimation and forecasting in ODE models, making it particularly relevant to health informatics and public health decision-making ( https://github.com/gchowell/BayesianFitForecast/ ).<h4>Results</h4>This toolbox enables automatic generation of Stan files, allowing users to configure models, define priors, and analyze results with minimal programming expertise. By eliminating manual coding, BayesianFitForecast significantly lowers the technical barrier to Bayesian inference with dynamical systems. We demonstrate its flexibility and usability through applications to historical epidemic datasets (e.g., the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco and the 1896-1897 Bombay plague) and simulated data, showing robust parameter estimation and forecasting performance under Poisson and negative binomial observation error structures. The toolbox also provides robust tools for evaluating model performance, including convergence diagnostics, posterior distributions, credible intervals, and performance metrics.<h4>Conclusion</h4>By improving the accessibility of advanced Bayesian methods, BayesianFitForecast broadens the application of Bayesian inference in time-series modeling, healthcare forecasting, and epidemiological applications. In addition to the R scripting interface, a built-in Shiny web application is included, enabling interactive model configuration, visualization, and forecasting.

41083839,EF-Gated 3D Capsule Networks with Spatially Decoupled Routing for Clinical Phenotyping of Heart Failure Subtypes in Cardiac MRI.,"Addressing the challenge of geometric feature modeling for heart failure subtype classification in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study proposes an Ejection Fraction (EF) Gated 3D Capsule Network (EG3D-CapsNet). Traditional 3D convolutional neural networks (e.g., Res3DNet-50) achieve only 46.00% (±9.75%) classification accuracy on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset due to parameter redundancy and inability to integrate clinical indicators. The method of this study breaks through this performance bottleneck via three core innovations: (1) a spatially decoupled dynamic routing mechanism that independently processes feature interactions at each anatomical location, enhancing local geometric modeling capability; (2) an EF-gated attention module that achieves fine-grained alignment of imaging features and clinical indicators through a learnable biomarker scaling strategy; (3) an orthogonal initialization scheme for capsule transformation matrices, improving routing stability in high-dimensional feature spaces. Experiments on 150 five-class cardiac MRI cases show that EG3D-CapsNet achieves an average accuracy of 65.33% (±6.53%) with a 91% reduction in parameters, representing an absolute improvement of 19.33 percentage points over the baseline model. Ablation studies confirm the EF gating mechanism contributes an 18.04% accuracy gain, and visualization analysis reveals high correlation between capsule activation regions and myocardial pathological features. This method provides a new paradigm for cardiac imaging-assisted diagnosis that is high-precision, lightweight, and interpretable.",Zhang Y; Hao X; Ma J,"Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, Shenyang, China.",Journal of imaging informatics in medicine,2025-10-13,10.1007/s10278-025-01702-4,4.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,abstract)",Cardiac Mri; Acdc Dataset; 3D Capsule Networks; Heart Failure Subtype Classification; Spatially Decoupled Routing

41101589,"Postoperative imaging of the shoulder: Rotator cuff, instability, arthroplasty.","The use of imaging after shoulder surgery should be considered carefully and should provide a real beneﬁt for the patient. It is not a routine request. Currently, there is no consensus on imaging indications for patients showing good postoperative progress, without complications and with satisfactory functional outcomes. In cases of unfavorable progress, the indications are clearer. Conventional radiography remains essential, and when combined with ultrasound, forms the ﬁrst-line approach. Second-line imaging techniques, such as CT scans or MRI, are selected based on the type of surgery performed, the patient's clinical context, and the diagnostic and/or therapeutic questions the surgeon is addressing. In France, CT scans, although easily accessible, involve ""controlled'' radiation exposure and can produce artifacts with metallic implants. MRI, which provides excellent visualization of soft tissues without radiation, can also present a risk of artifacts, although recent technological advances have mitigated this issue. CT arthrography is commonly used in France, whereas MRI arthrography is underutilized, despite being effective. Scintigraphy has very limited indications. Performing an ultrasound exam requires specific training and has a learning curve. It can be valuable in the hands of a trained orthopedic surgeon, used as an extension of the clinical examination and referred to as ""echoscopy''. However, a specialized musculoskeletal radiologist can often provide a more accurate dynamic diagnosis compared to static cross-sectional imaging. Thus, any imaging request should result from collaboration between surgeons and radiologists, and be tailored to the available resources, which can vary across different healthcare regions.

41101332,Design of a fisheye arthroscope with an ultra-wide field of view for viewing joints.,"The field of view (FOV) is a critical parameter in optical endoscopic systems that directly influences a physician's ability to inspect internal anatomical structures thoroughly and accurately without repositioning the device. This study designs and optimizes a rigid arthroscope equipped with a fisheye lens to achieve an ultra-wide 200° field of view, thereby enhancing joint visualization. The fisheye lens is specifically redesigned and optimized to function as the objective lens, and a gradient-index (GRIN) rod is employed to relay the image from the objective to the eyepiece. The device is optimized for the short working distances of arthroscopy, while its ~0.7-500 mm refocusing range (via minor eyepiece adjustment) also makes it adaptable to endoscopic applications that require longer working distances. Image-quality metrics are used to evaluate aberrations, particularly those caused by the increased viewing angle. While wide viewing angles typically amplify off-axis aberrations, the optimized design reduces and balances these residuals to preserve high image quality, and its performance is benchmarked against a high-definition arthroscope featuring a 70° field of view.

To address this issue, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can encapsulate FePt NPs to improve stability and imaging contrast. Additionally, red blood cell membrane (RBC-m) coating enhances tumor tissue accumulation, enabling real-time tracking and diagnosis of HCC. Initial studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this technology in HCC imaging diagnosis, contributing to disease monitoring and treatment evaluation. With further optimization, these nanocomposite probes have the potential to enhance MRI-based HCC diagnostics, bridging molecular biology and clinical imaging to advance personalized medicine.",Chan MH; Zhuang RE; Wei DH; Hsiao M,"Department of Biomedical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan. mhchan@nycu.edu.tw.",Nanoscale,2025-10-16,10.1039/d5nr03294f,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41110111,Selective and Sensitive Fluorescent Turn-On Switch for Arsenic(III) Monitoring in Rice by a Nitrogen-Rich Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework. ,"Inorganic As(III), the major form of pollutant of arsenic contamination, tends to accumulate easily in rice, causing serious global health risks. Therefore, it is highly desirable to seek credible methods to achieve efficient management of As3+ that can conduct selective and sensitive monitoring. Herein, this work presents a rational design of a covalent organic framework (COF)-based turn-on fluorescent-sensing platform to detect As3+. The design concept is proven via framing nitrogen-rich functionalized COF material, Dpy-DhBt: these nitrogen-based sites are highly selective As3+ receptors, and the π-connection skeleton is a signal responder. Once As3+ is introduced to coordinate with Dpy-DhBt, significant fluorescence turn-on emerged with a clear color change via hindering the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. As a sensing platform, the remarkable exhibition of Dpy-DhBt was acquired in facile visualization, favorable sensibility, and real-time answer. The exceptional surface area and porous structure of Dpy-DhBt facilitate superior interaction with As3+, which contributes to an ultrafast response time of 10 s. For As3+ monitoring, Dpy-DhBt achieved an ultrasensitive detection limit of 7.5 nM. More attractively, Dpy-DhBt has also been prosperously employed to detect As3+ in actual rice samples in satisfying recovery. This work reveals great prospects of fluorescent COF for detection of As3+ and provides new insights into the research of toxic metal detection in food samples with the easy framing of novel COF materials via clever introduction of chelating sites.",Liu Y; Mu D; Yu Y,"College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Zaozhuang University, Zaozhuang 277160, China.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2025-10-19,10.1021/acs.langmuir.5c03597,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41081985,PET imaging of mitochondrial complex-I in the adenine-induced tubulointerstitial nephropathy mouse model using [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]BCPP-BF.,"<h4>Background</h4>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a significant global health burden with limited effective treatments for its prevention, progression, and associated complications. Mitochondrial dysfunction is recognized as a pivotal factor in the development of kidney diseases, with mitochondrial complex-I (MC-I) playing a crucial role in assessing overall mitochondrial function. Recent advancements in selective MC-I positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands now allow for non-invasive visualization and quantification of renal mitochondrial status in vivo. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the utility of [<sup>18</sup>F]BCPP-BF in the adenine induced tubulointerstitial nephropathy model.<h4>Results</h4>Binding of the MC-I targeted PET radioligand, [<sup>18</sup>F]BCPP-BF, showed a gradual decline in the kidneys of mice on an adenine-rich diet. [<sup>18</sup>F]BCPP-BF binding decreased by 59-61% compared to baseline after two weeks of adenine treatment. These results of reduced uptake were further confirmed by in vitro autoradiography. In kidneys from adenine-fed mice, [<sup>18</sup>F]BCPP-BF specific binding was reduced by 65.6% compared to control kidney sections.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Altogether, the findings suggest that [<sup>18</sup>F]BCPP-BF holds potential as an imaging biomarker for renal failure. However, further preclinical studies and validation in human subjects are necessary before it can be established as a reliable indicator for the progression of CKD.",Dahl K; Johnström P; Toth M; Sousa VC; Ericsson C; Strömstedt M; Inghardt T; Cortés González MA; Reznichenko A; Jucaite A; Cselényi Z; Unwin R; Ohba H; Halldin C; Challis B; Tsukada H; Schou M,"PET Science Centre, Precision Medicine and Biosamples, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. kenneth.dahl@astrazeneca.com.",EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry,2025-10-13,10.1186/s41181-025-00392-1,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Positron emission tomography; Kidney Disease; Radiopharmaceutical; Mc-i
41093666,Assessing Injectate Volume in Injection Laryngoplasty Using Low-Cost Handheld Ultrasonography: Feasibility Study in an Ex Vivo Porcine Model.,"<h4>Objectives/hypotheses</h4>To evaluate the utility of low-cost handheld ultrasound in measuring volumes of injected material in injection laryngoplasty (IL) using an ex vivo porcine model.<h4>Study design</h4>Feasibility study.<h4>Methods</h4>Two different injection volumes (0.375 and 0.75 mL) and two types of materials (hyaluronic acid (HA) and calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA)) were injected under direct visualization into porcine vocal folds. Seven replicates were performed for each of the four experimental groups. Cross-sectional longest and shortest dimensions were measured with ultrasound in the paramedian position. The correlation between injected volume and measured cross-sectional area by material type was assessed by ANCOVA.<h4>Results</h4>Injections of HA and CaHA into porcine vocal folds were able to be observed with US. Measured cross-sectional area significantly increased with greater volumes of injectate (0.375 mL: 0.29 ± 0.11 cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.750 mL: 0.38 ± 0.16 cm<sup>2</sup>; P = 0.0151). While measured cross-sectional areas were marginally lower for HA compared to CaHA at both levels of volume injected, this was not statistically significant (P = 0.0875). Similarly, material type did not affect the relation between measured area and injected volume (P = 0.8805).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ultrasound measurements may be feasible in assessing the injectate amount in vocal folds injection augmentation. This may be useful in situations where residual injectate amount in the vocal folds is important for clinical decisions, such as timing of thyroplasty after IL. Further clinical studies may elucidate the utility of ultrasound measurements of vocal fold injectate in relation to voice outcomes and stroboscopic findings.<h4>Level of evidence: 5</h4>",Lee M; Clark CM; Kervin SR; Baik E; Rameau A,"Sean Parker Institute for the Voice, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,2025-10-14,10.1016/j.jvoice.2025.09.036,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Office Procedure; Injection Laryngoplasty; Vocal Fold Paralysis; Handheld Ultrasound
41091328,Augmented reality vs CAD/CAM system in orthognathic surgery: development and accuracy evaluation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) have gained increasing interest in surgical applications, particularly in maxillofacial surgery. This study evaluates the accuracy and reproducibility of an AR-based navigation system using optical see-through (OST) headsets, in comparison to traditional CAD/CAM-guided approaches for Le Fort I osteotomy. Twenty identical stereolithographic skull models were divided into two groups: one group treated with OST-based AR navigation system to visualize virtual surgical lines on the skull models (n = 10) and the other treated with the conventional CAD/CAM procedure using titanium materialise surgical guides (n = 10). Virtual surgical planning (VSP) was carried out identically for both groups.<h4>Results</h4>Surgical accuracy was assessed by measuring deviations (in mm) between planned and postoperative positions of seven cephalometric reference points. All models in the CAD group achieved deviations below the 2-mm clinical threshold (mean deviation: 0.72 ± 0.38 mm). However, only 4 out of 10 in the OST group met this threshold (mean deviation: 2.27 ± 1.24 mm). A statistical analysis using Mann-Whitney U-test with a significance level of 0.05 was carried out to compare the mean accuracy between OST and CAD groups. The results revealed a statistically significant difference between OST and CAD groups (p-value < 0.005). Nevertheless, progressive improvements in the OST group were observed, likely reflecting a learning curve associated with the new technology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although CAD/CAM remains more accurate, the AR-based system offers advantages in real-time visualization and reduced costs and preoperative time by eliminating the need for 3D-printed guides. However, the current accuracy limitations highlight the need for further refinement of AR systems and increased operator training. Future studies are needed to validate the clinical applicability and reliability of AR-guided orthognathic surgery.",Civita F; Rota I; Rossi DS; Sinatra A; Beltramini GA; Bolzoni AR,"Maxillofacial and Dental Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.",Maxillofacial plastic and reconstructive surgery,2025-10-15,10.1186/s40902-025-00471-y,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Maxillofacial Surgery; computer-assisted surgery; Orthognathic Surgery; Augmented Reality
41088547,Fast 3D UTE in vivo T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and $$ {\mathrm{T}}_2^{\ast } $$ mapping of fast relaxing knee tissues at 3 T.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>UTE MR imaging captures quantitative signals in fast-relaxing tissues, enabling anatomical visualization and quantitative assessment of T<sub>1</sub> and T2*$$ {\mathrm{T}}_2^{\ast } $$ relaxation times. However, the clinical application of quantitative UTE MRI is limited by long acquisition times. Therefore, this study introduces a novel UTE-based method for T<sub>1</sub> and T2*$$ {\mathrm{T}}_2^{\ast } $$ mapping, achieving submillimeter resolution in less than 10 min.<h4>Theory and methods</h4>The method employs a dual-echo acquisition for fast T2*$$ {\mathrm{T}}_2^{\ast } $$ mapping, augmented by an additional acquisition with different T<sub>1</sub> weighting. This second scan enables the computation of signal ratios between scans with different T<sub>1</sub>-weighting. These measured signal ratios are then compared to a lookup table containing distinct ratios, corresponding to discrete T<sub>1</sub> values. The approach was validated in phantom solutions mimicking various T<sub>1</sub> and T2*$$ {\mathrm{T}}_2^{\ast } $$ times and applied in vivo to quantify relaxation times across different knee tissue compartments in healthy individuals.<h4>Results</h4>The method demonstrated its reliability for T<sub>1</sub> and T2*$$ {\mathrm{T}}_2^{\ast } $$ quantification in rapidly relaxing tissues (1-11 ms). However, it exhibited a tendency to underestimate T2*$$ {\mathrm{T}}_2^{\ast } $$ in skeletal muscle. This limitation arises from the chosen TEs being inadequate to capture slow signal decays. In accordance with the findings of preceding studies, this in vivo study identified three distinct T<sub>1</sub> categories of tissue characterized by short (adipose tissue), moderate (ligaments, tendons, and menisci), and long (skeletal muscle) T<sub>1</sub> values.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The presented technique for combined T<sub>1</sub> and T2*$$ {\mathrm{T}}_2^{\ast } $$ mapping enables relaxometry in rapidly relaxing tissues, indicating potential for advanced tissue characterization in clinical settings.",Rothe M; Riedel S; Slawig A; Deistung A; Bohndorf K; Brill R; Wohlgemuth WA; Gussew A,"University Clinic and Outpatient Clinic for Radiology, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany.",Magnetic resonance in medicine,2025-10-14,10.1002/mrm.70099,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Knee joint; Quantitative Imaging; T1 Mapping; Ute; T2*$$ {\Mathrm{t}}_2^{\ast } $$ Mapping
41081694,The EZ- Blocker®- A Safer Alternative in Complex Airway Scenarios: A Case Series.,"<h4>Background</h4>One-lung ventilation (OLV) is crucial in thoracic surgery as it ensures optimal visibility and effective isolation of the lung. Various devices, such as double-lumen tubes and bronchial blockers, help achieve effective OLV. While double-lumen tubes (DLTs) are considered the gold standard for lung isolation certain clinical scenarios may make their use challenging or contraindicated. In these cases, the EZ-Blocker® (Teleflex Medical, Morrisville, NC, USA) presents distinct advantages. This paper discusses a series of six cases where DLTs were not feasible, highlighting our experience with the EZ-Blocker® as a viable alternative.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We analyzed patients aged 18 years and older who underwent various thoracic surgeries in the department of Anaesthesiology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, from January 2024 to September 2024. This study specifically focused on cases involving the intraoperative use of the EZ-Blocker® for one-lung ventilation.<h4>Results</h4>The EZ-Blocker® was used in challenging situations such as difficult airway management, and lung isolation in intubated patients, and in those with tracheostomies. The placement of nearly all EZ bronchial blockers was accomplished without complications, resulting in a success rate of 99%. Adequate lung collapse was achieved in all patients, with no serious airway injuries or immediate complications reported.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The EZ-Blocker® is an effective and safe airway device designed for one-lung ventilation, particularly in scenarios where DLTs are unsuitable. Its advantages include easy placement, adaptability to abnormal airway anatomy, reduced airway trauma, and enhanced visualization during bronchoscopy. These features make it a superior alternative to traditional double-lumen tubes for managing complex airway scenarios.",Kumar SN; Panchanathan I; Singh S; Benedicta RR; Kuppuswamy B; Davis K; Dharmalingam SK,"Department of Cardiac Anaesthesia, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.",Annals of cardiac anaesthesia,2025-10-13,10.4103/aca.aca_57_25,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),One Lung Ventilation; Difficult Airway; Ez Blocker
41082720,Electron-Shuttling Mechanisms Drive Proximity Labeling to Unveil Tumor Marker Characteristics in Ovarian Cancer from Clinical Samples.,"In this study, we presented a revolutionary proximity labeling platform, MOF-HRP-Apt, which for the first time integrated electron mediation into the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed proximity labeling system. This novel strategy enabled a single molecular recognition event into multiple covalent labeling events, amplifying spatial signals and enhancing detection sensitivity of the tumor biomarker PTK7. The platform utilized the redox-active iron-based metal-organic framework (MOF) material NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-88B, whose Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> redox center facilitated electron transfer to the active site of HRP, dramatically boosting HRP's catalytic activity toward phenol oxidation and accelerating phenoxo radical generation. These radicals could covalently label tyrosine residues in PTK7 and its adjacent proteins to achieve efficient spatial localization. Compared to conventional HRP-Apt strategies, MOF-HRP-Apt platform exhibited significantly stronger labeling signals (1.74-3 folds increase) and improved signal-to-noise ratios (1.93-2.2 folds enhancement) in cellular models. It maintained robust performance even under challenging conditions of low PTK7 expression, siRNA-mediated knockdown, or paclitaxel-induced suppression. Moreover, in clinical tissue specimens, our platform successfully enabled stratified PTK7 visualization across the ovarian cancer progression spectrum─from normal tissue through early to advanced stages, demonstrating its exceptional sensitivity and adaptability in complex biological environments. By combining target-specific recognition with signal amplification, this strategy offered the ultrasensitive detection of low-abundance biomarkers. With its remarkable potential for early cancer screening, real-time molecular tracking, and personalized therapeutic development, our platform represents a significant leap forward in molecular diagnostics. This study exemplifies the transformative power of electron-mediated proximity labeling, offering a promising avenue for advancing precision medicine and molecular biology.",Wei Y; Zheng L; Hu Z; Shen L; Jiao J; Jiao J; Guo Y,"School of Public Health, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250117, Shandong, China.",Analytical chemistry,2025-10-13,10.1021/acs.analchem.5c04168,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
41088050,Application of saphenous nerve infrapatellar branch protection technique in total knee arthroplasty.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This randomized controlled trial conducted a comparative analysis of postoperative outcomes between a modified anteromedial incision with saphenous nerve protection and the traditional medial parapatellar approach in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We aimed to test the hypothesis that the nerve-sparing modified technique would significantly reduce postoperative anterior knee numbness and pain while maintaining surgical feasibility.<h4>Methods</h4>Sixty-eight TKA candidates (January 2022-June 2023) were prospectively randomized into two groups: Modified (n = 34) and Traditional (n = 34) approaches. The modified technique featured an anteromedial incision with infrapatellar branch visualization and preservation, whereas the control group received the traditional medial parapatellar exposure. Primary outcomes included numbness area and the Visual Analog Scale score; secondary outcomes encompassed surgical parameters (duration, blood loss) and functional recovery (Hospital for Special Surgery Knee score).<h4>Results</h4>Thirty one patients were randomized to the M group and 29 patients allocated to the T group. Compared to the T group, the M group demonstrated significantly lower VAS scores at 3 days, 7 days, and 2 weeks postoperatively, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The M group showed a statistically significant reduction in the area of numbness compared to the T group at all postoperative follow-up intervals: 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year (P < 0.05 for all time points). However, postoperative HSS scores did not differ significantly between the M group and the T group at any follow-up interval (P > 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The nerve-preserving modified approach achieved superior patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in reducing anterior knee numbness and early postoperative pain without compromising prosthesis implantation accuracy or functional recovery trajectories, suggesting its potential as a standardized refinement in TKA surgical protocols.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2500107220, 6 August 2025, retrospectively registered.",Mao ZQ; Li K; Zhang Z; Li T; Lu JH; Fan MQ; Chu XB,"Department of Orthopaedics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine), Hangzhou, China.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,2025-10-14,10.1186/s12891-025-09099-5,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Knee joint; saphenous nerve; Total Knee Arthroplasty; Modified Surgery; Protection Technology
41109944,"Digital and AI-assisted multimodal supportive care, combining physical activity, nutrition, and pain management during chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer patients: study protocol of the European multicenter randomized controlled trial of the RELEVIUM project.","<h4>Background</h4>Multimodal care, including nutritional support, physical exercise, and pain management, is essential to address complex therapeutic challenges in advanced pancreatic cancer. There is an increasing prevalence worldwide in pancreatic cancer and the disease is often diagnosed late leading to limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Advanced pancreatic cancer patients experience a wide range of adverse symptoms that affect their quality of life and require comprehensive and interdisciplinary patient care early in treatment. Integrating digital health, particularly through remote monitoring, plays a vital role in addressing the therapeutic challenges and improving data-driven clinical decision-making. Therefore, the European project RELEVIUM examines the effect of a personalized, digitally assisted multimodal supportive care intervention on health-related quality of life in patients with pancreatic cancer aiming to improve early access to multidisciplinary, cost-effective palliative care.<h4>Methods</h4>In cancer centers in Estonia, Israel, and Germany, 132 patients will be randomly assigned in the prospective randomized controlled trial RELEVIUM-RCT into two groups. Both groups receive standard chemotherapy. The control group follows usual care, while the intervention group receives personalized, digitally assisted multimodal support integrated into usual care. The intervention includes guidance and monitoring on pain, nutrition, fatigue, sarcopenia, and physical activity. Patients track their physical activities, nutritional behavior and rate pain and fatigue daily via a smartwatch and mobile app. The physician analyses these longitudinal data on a dashboard and counsels the patients every two weeks during clinical visits, assisted by an interdisciplinary team and digital support system. The primary endpoint of the study is health-related quality of life including factors such as time until a definitive deterioration in selected dimensions (physical functioning and/or appetite loss) assessed at 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints include longitudinal analyses of efficacy related to pain, physical function, nutrition, sarcopenia, and socioeconomic factors.<h4>Discussion</h4>The RELEVIUM-RCT investigates the efficacy of digital health support for individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer in conjunction with conventional treatments in three European countries. Longitudinal data on the interplay of chemotherapy toxicity, fatigue, pain, physical activity, and nutrition will provide valuable extended insights on multimodal pancreatic cancer care. Moreover, this data can help demonstrate the benefits of digital health in clinical decision-making, ultimately contributing to improved quality of care in Europe.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Registry: German Clinical Trials Register; Registration number: DRKS00037143; Date of registration: 5th of June 2025.",Hillen B; Oestreicher G; Schwab L; Enders K; Simon P; Elme A; Ben-Aharon I; Goshenlago T; Neuzillet C; Sclafani F; Beltran EEM; Schuster M; Doncheva H; Ruckes C; Karlecik M; Petrowski K; Rosenbaum D; Diou C; Ballas A; Vlachostergiou A; Mastricci D; Scherrer A; Pilz M; Flechsig J; Apostolidis L; Krooupa AM; Chintha S; Musisi IW; Tzavara NP; Kakasis A; Hadjikypri X; Karra S; Chatzipanagiotou K; Drivas I; Dacasa H; Moehler M,"Institute of Sport Science, Dpt.

41105657,On the road to vision zero: How unit-dose dispensing systems and health-IT are transforming clinical practices.,"The study investigates real-world prescribing patterns and validation workflows linked to the implementation of a Unit-Dose Dispensing System (UDDS) within a digital medication management framework. The overall goal is to enhance medication safety, minimize errors, and improve clinical efficiency and workflow processes. Retrospective analysis of prescription data from the Electronic Medication System (EMS) in 2023 at a large tertiary care teaching hospital focused on physicians` prescribing patterns, drug compatibility with UDDS, and challenges faced by pharmacists during validation. Interactive dashboards provided real-time insights into prescription types, volumes, timing, and pharmacist validation rates. Of the 4.7 million doses prescribed in 2023, 64% were UDDS-compatible, highlighting its strong potential to streamline workflows and reduce nursing workload on the wards. Dashboard analysis revealed a clear alignment between peak prescribing times and UDDS production schedules, indicating effective synchronization between clinical and logistical workflows. Notably, an average of 631.6 blister-packable doses per day remained unvalidated by clinical pharmacists due to contraindications, dosage discrepancies, or duplicate prescriptions, emphasizing the need for enhanced health-IT support to address these gaps. UDDS combined with interactive dashboards enables targeted filtering and rapid identification of trends and gaps in pharmacotherapy. Integrating UDDS into a digital medication management framework offers significant potential to improve patient safety and operational efficiency. Key challenges in implementing UDDS into routine clinical practice were identified. Adhering to prescription submission cut-off times is essential to ensure UDDS effectiveness. Tailoring UDDS workflows and interactive dashboards to department-specific needs can further improve medication safety, strengthen pharmacists' oversight, and support the long-term sustainability of safe and efficient medication practices.",Herrmann S; Bräuer N; Zimmermann T; Steiner T; Fenske D; Gerstmeier J,"Clinical Pharmacy, Helios Kliniken GmbH, Berlin, Germany.",PLOS digital health,2025-10-17,10.1371/journal.pdig.0001023,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),

To reduce incoming calls, we implemented a shell test with a monitored dashboard, enabling nursing staff to electronically request blood product release for their patients. To reduce outgoing calls, we developed a web-based application for critical values that sends a secure message with patient information and the critical value, which the provider must acknowledge or refuse. Critical value disposition information is then fed back into the critical value application, and in the event of refusal to acknowledge, the technologist initiates timely escalation via manual workflows. We assessed incoming call volume for blood products, formal complaints, critical value notification turnaround time, and end-user satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>We significantly reduced incoming calls and formal complaints and received positive end-user satisfaction feedback for the critical value application. We did not find a difference in critical value reporting turnaround time after the intervention.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We successfully built IT-driven solutions, which reduced incoming and outgoing phone calls in our clinical laboratories.

40619870,Dust-borne emerging contaminants: an underrecognized risk factor for non-communicable diseases in older Chinese adults.,"Given global aging and the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), identifying environmental risk factors in older adults is critical. This study investigated the associations between dust-borne emerging contaminant (EC) exposures and several high-incidence NCDs in older adults. 137 province-level dust measurements of microplastics, liquid crystal monomers, organophosphate esters, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances across 23 provinces were used to estimate exposure levels for 14 466 Chinese participants (mean age 84.7). Propensity score-adjusted logistic regression showed significantly higher odds of NCDs at the third <i>vs.</i> first tertile of specific exposure, including hypertension [polyethylene terephthalates: odds ratio (OR), 1.28; 95% confidence interval (CI), (1.16-1.41), <i>etc.</i>], heart disease [perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>12</sub>): 1.25 (1.04-1.49), <i>etc.</i>], cataract [organophosphate triesters: 1.61 (1.32-1.96), <i>etc.</i>], stroke [polycarbonates: 1.30 (1.06-1.58), <i>etc.</i>], respiratory diseases [organophosphate triesters: 1.57 (1.27-1.94), <i>etc.</i>], and arthritis [PFCAs (C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>12</sub>): 1.73 (1.34-2.24), <i>etc.</i>]. G-computation estimated 6-13% absolute increases in disease probability (∼60-130 additional cases per 1000) from low- to high-exposure scenarios. Subgroup analyses suggested stronger associations among females, the oldest participants, and eastern residents.
