40998279,Measuring and visualizing healthcare process variability.,"<h4>Importance</h4>Understanding factors that contribute to clinical variability in patient care is critical, as unwarranted variability can lead to increased adverse events and prolonged hospital stays. Determining when this variability becomes excessive can be a step in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.<h4>Objective</h4>Explore the association between clinical variation and clinical outcomes. This study aims to identify the point in time when the relationship between clinical variation and length of stay (LOS) becomes significant.<h4>Methods</h4>This cohort study uses MIMIC-IV, a dataset collecting electronic health records of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the United States. We focused on adult patients who underwent elective coronary bypass surgery, generating 847 patient observations. Demographic factors such as age, race, insurance type, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were recorded. We performed a variability analysis where patients' clinical processes are represented as sequences of events. The data was segmented based on the initial day of recorded activity to establish observation windows. Using a regression analysis, we identified the temporal window where variability's impact on LOS becomes independently significant.<h4>Result</h4>Regression analysis revealed that patients in the top 20 % of the variability distance group experienced an 81 % increase in LOS (95 % CI: 1.72 to 1.91, p < 0.001). Insurance types, such as Medicare and Other, were associated with 18 % (95 % CI: 0.73 to 0.92, p < 0.001) and 21 % (95 % CI: 0.71 to 0.88, p < 0.001) decreases in LOS, respectively. Neither age nor race significantly affected LOS, but a higher CCI was associated with a 3.3 % increase in LOS (95 % CI: 1.02 to 1.05, p < 0.001). These findings indicate that higher variability and CCI significantly influence LOS, with insurance type also playing a crucial role.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In the studied cohort, patient journeys with greater variability were associated with longer LOS with a dose-response relationship: the higher the variability, the longer LOS.

41005002,Effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based visualization for surgical anatomy education: A cluster quasirandomized controlled trial. ,"Although surgical techniques have advanced markedly, surgical education for medical students has remained largely traditional. Because of the importance of accurate recognition of intraoperative anatomy, passive observation is insufficient for novice learners. This study evaluated the educational effectiveness of an artificial intelligence-based visualization system that highlights anatomical structures during surgery in real time. We conducted a cluster quasi-randomized controlled trial involving fifth-year medical students assigned to receive either conventional intraoperative teaching (cohort C) or instruction augmented by artificial intelligence-based visualization (cohort A). Each student annotated the pancreatic regions on 6 static laparoscopic or robotic images before and after clinical observation training. Performance was assessed using 3 image segmentation metrics: recall (minimizing false negatives), precision (avoiding false positives), and the Dice coefficient, which integrates recall and precision. The Dice coefficient served as the primary outcome, whereas recall and precision served as secondary outcomes. Both cohorts showed similar baseline performance and improved across all metrics after training. However, cohort A exhibited a significantly greater improvement in recall than cohort C (ΔRecall: 0.112 vs 0.013, P = .020), indicating enhanced sensitivity in identifying pancreatic regions. Precision did not differ significantly between the groups (P = .746). The Dice coefficient improved more in cohort A than in cohort C (ΔDice: 0.087 vs 0.028), although the between-group difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .097). Scatter plot analysis showed that many cohort A students exhibited increased recall without loss of precision, suggesting improved recognition accuracy. Incorporating artificial intelligence-based visualization into surgical anatomy education may enhance medical students' recognition of intraoperative anatomy, particularly for visually complex structures such as the pancreas.",Nakao E; Igeta M; Kobayashi N; Kumazu Y; Otani Y; Murakami M; Kohno S; Hojo Y; Nakamura T; Kurahashi Y; Ishida Y; Shinohara H,"Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Hyogo Medical University, Nishinomiya City, Hyogo, Japan.",Surgery,2025-09-25,10.1016/j.surg.2025.109723,9.1,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract); artificial intelligence(title,abstract)",
40993711,A visual analysis of research hotspots and trends on macrodactyly between 2005 and 2024.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To conduct a visualization analysis of macrodactyly research from 2005 to 2024, providing a comprehensive overview of research trends, key contributors, and emerging topics.<h4>Methods</h4>A visual analysis of macrodactyly related publications from 2005 to 2024 was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection database. Publication trends, country and institutional contributions, author collaboration networks, and keyword co-occurrences were analyzed. Statistical analysis and visualization were performed using Microsoft Excel, R, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred and fifty-three publications were included. Annual publication trends showed fluctuations but an overall growth in interest over time, with notable growth from 2011 to 2014 peaking at 15 publications in 2014. The United States led with 128 publications, followed by China (60), Italy (40), Japan (36), and Turkey (27), with prominent institutions such as Mayo Clinic and Harvard University playing pivotal roles. Key authors like Dr. Marybeth Ezaki, working with the team at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, made substantial contributions to establishing diagnostic frameworks. Most importantly, keyword analysis revealed a fundamental shift in research focus from clinical and surgical themes (represented by keywords such as ""foot,"" ""hand,"" and ""osteotomy"" in early periods) to molecular and genetic investigations (characterized by ""PIK3CA,"" ""activating mutations,"" and ""overgrowth"" in recent years). The strongest citation burst was ""overgrowth"" (2016-2020), followed by genetic-related terms, with ""activating mutations"" representing the most recent trend (2020-2024), indicating increasing emphasis on PIK3CA mutations as the current research hotspot.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study highlights the evolution of macrodactyly research and reveals fluctuating publication trends and substantial contributions from key countries, authors, and institutions.

40996043,Recent advances in cardiac imaging: emerging use of three-dimensional visualization for analyzing complex cardiovascular anatomy.,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Technical progress in noninvasive medical imaging continues to enhance diagnosis and intervention, with three-dimensional (3D) imaging emerging as a significant advancement over traditional methods. While 3D visualization is widely used to evaluate a living heart, precise measurement from such images remains challenging. This review describes a new technique named isosurface geometric measurement on volume-rendered images (IMVR), which facilitates accurate 3D measurement of complex cardiovascular anatomy.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Direct volume rendering provides clear visualization and tissue identification, but the lack of exact spatial boundaries inherently makes measurement of any anatomical feature difficult. However, by superimposing a surface-rendered polygonal mesh (representing isosurface geometry) onto a variably transparent volume image of the heart, IMVR enables significantly easier and more accurate 3D measurement. This technique demonstrates versatility across various cardiovascular, anatomical, and clinical applications, including preinterventional assessment and planning for structural heart diseases, notably expanding 3D imaging's utility toward precision medicine and personalized treatment.<h4>Summary</h4>This review article summarizes recent advances in cardiac imaging, highlighting an efficient IMVR technique, which combines volume-rendered images with superimposed surface-rendered image to facilitate accurate 3D measurements of cardiac anatomical features.",Kamiya K; Nagatani Y; Nakata S; Seguchi R; Verma S,Department of Cardiovascular Surgery.,Current opinion in cardiology,2025-09-25,10.1097/hco.0000000000001260,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",computed tomography; 3d Measurement; Cardiac Anatomy; Volume-rendered Image
40990216,Photon-counting detector computed tomography in thoracic oncology: revolutionizing tumor imaging through precision and detail.,"Photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) is an emerging imaging technology that promises to overcome the limitations of conventional energy-integrating detector (EID)-CT, particularly in thoracic oncology. This narrative review summarizes technical advances and clinical applications of PCD-CT in the thorax with emphasis on spatial resolution, dose-image-quality balance, and intrinsic spectral imaging, and it outlines practical implications relevant to thoracic oncology. A literature review of PubMed through May 31, 2025, was conducted using combinations of ""photon counting,"" ""computed tomography,"" ""thoracic oncology,"" and ""artificial intelligence."" We screened the retrieved records and included studies with direct relevance to lung and mediastinal tumors, image quality, radiation dose, spectral/iodine imaging, or artificial intelligence-based reconstruction; case reports, editorials, and animal-only or purely methodological reports were excluded. PCD-CT demonstrated superior spatial resolution compared with EID-CT, enabling clearer visualization of fine pulmonary structures, such as bronchioles and subsolid nodules; slice thicknesses of approximately 0.4 mm and <i>ex vivo</i> resolvable structures approaching 0.11 mm have been reported. Across intraindividual clinical comparisons, radiation-dose reductions of 16%-43% have been achieved while maintaining or improving diagnostic image quality. Intrinsic spectral imaging enables accurate iodine mapping and low-keV virtual monoenergetic images and has shown quantitative advantages versus dual-energy CT in phantoms and early clinical work. Artificial intelligence-based deep-learning reconstruction and super-resolution can complement detector capabilities to reduce noise and stabilize fine-structure depiction without increasing dose. Potential reductions in contrast volume are biologically plausible given improved low-keV contrast-to-noise ratio, although clinical dose-finding data remain limited, and routine K-edge imaging has not yet translated to clinical thoracic practice. In conclusion, PCD-CT provides higher spatial and spectral fidelity at lower or comparable doses, supporting earlier and more precise tumor detection and characterization; future work should prioritize outcome-oriented trials, protocol harmonization, and implementation studies aligned with ""Green Radiology"".",Yanagawa M; Ueno M; Ito R; Ueda D; Saida T; Kurokawa R; Takumi K; Nishioka K; Sugawara S; Ide S; Honda M; Iima M; Kawamura M; Sakata A; Sofue K; Oda S; Watabe T; Hirata K; Naganawa S,"The University of Osaka Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Osaka, Japan.","Diagnostic and interventional radiology (Ankara, Turkey)",2025-09-24,10.4274/dir.2025.253550,6.0,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(kw,abstract); data(abstract)",Artificial intelligence; Cancer; Iodine; Diagnosis; computed tomography; Spectral Imaging; Spatial Resolution; Radiation Dose Reduction
40996516,A radiomics nomogram utilizing T2-weighted MRI for accurate diagnosis of rectocele.,"<h4>Background</h4>Rectocele (RC) is a common pelvic organ prolapse (POP) that can cause obstructed defecation and reduced quality of life. Magnetic resonance defecography (MRD) offers high-resolution, radiation-free visualization of pelvic floor anatomy but relies on time-consuming, observer-dependent manual measurements. Our research constructs a nomogram model incorporating intra-ROI and habitat radiomics features to improve MRD-based RC diagnosis.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed 222 MRD patients (155 training, 67 testing). Clinical features were selected via univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was applied, and features with non-zero coefficients were retained to construct the radiomics signatures. A support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm was used to construct the intra-ROI combined with the habitat radiomics model. Clinical features were then combined with radiomics features using a multivariable logistic regression algorithm to generate a clinical-radiomics nomogram. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA).<h4>Results</h4>The combined intra-ROI and habitat radiomics model outperformed intra-ROI or habitat radiomics models alone, achieving areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.913 (training) and 0.805 (testing). The nomogram integrating radiomics features and gender showed strong calibration and discrimination, with AUCs of 0.930 and 0.852 in the training and testing cohorts, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings suggest that integrating intra-ROI with habitat radiomics features can aid RC assessment. While the clinical-radiomics nomogram showed the highest internal performance, this single-center retrospective study lacks external validation and includes a relatively small test cohort. Therefore, risk of model overfitting cannot be excluded.

40992774,Using I-PASS to improve nursing handoffs across the continuum of care at a tertiary oncology hospital.,"<h4>Background</h4>Communication failures can cause medical errors that harm patients. Handoffs occur frequently every day-every time a patient is transferred from one nurse to another (eg, shift change, hospital location). At our comprehensive cancer centre, handoffs became a priority focus area in our institution.<h4>Purpose</h4>We implemented the evidence-based handoff tool I-PASS (Illness Severity, Patient Summary, Action List, Situation Awareness and Contingency Planning, and Synthesis by Receiver) for all nurses at our comprehensive cancer centre and assessed the uptake of the new framework and subsequent compliance and safety outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Our team comprised representatives from nursing education, operations and informatics; a healthcare systems engineer; and electronic health record (EHR) analysts. Based on our observations of handoffs in different settings and feedback from focus group sessions, we developed an I-PASS handoff workflow in our EHR with the engagement of frontline staff and unit leaders. Various education modalities were implemented, and compliance was monitored through an EHR dashboard. Handoff audits were conducted for over a year after I-PASS was implemented to observe compliance with I-PASS reports for verbal handoffs. The institution's regularly administered safety culture survey results were assessed in the category of handoffs and information exchange.<h4>Results</h4>Our process measures, all nurses were trained to use I-PASS by 28 November 2022. Compliance in documenting I-PASS handoffs varied between 86% and 88% of all handoffs between December 2022 and April 2024. I-PASS elements were present in above 95% of verbal handoffs between April 2023 and April 2024. The percentage of clinical nurses who reported favourable handoffs in our institutional safety culture survey improved from 64% in 2022 to 72% in 2024. For our outcome measure, a rate of zero high-harm events was maintained during the same period.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The dissemination method led to the full implementation of I-PASS across all nursing areas and improved handoff quality.",Ait Aiss M; Vesho D; Bowe C; Franco Vega MC; Chau S; Beno J; George M; Porter C; Bodurka D,"Education & Training Division, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA mait@mdanderson.org.",BMJ open quality,2025-09-23,10.1136/bmjoq-2025-003443,4.0,dashboard(abstract); informatics(abstract); electronic health record(abstract),Quality improvement; Education; Patient Safety
41004421,Unlocking insights from complex data: Leveraging heat maps for decision-making in LMIC. ,"In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), health outcomes are often constrained by inadequate or misdirected resource allocation and limited access to services such as contraception and immunization. We explore the use of spatial heat maps to analyze the stock availability and dispensation/vaccination patterns of contraceptives and vaccines in Pakistan. We used data from national contraceptive (cLMIS) and vaccine logistics management information systems (vLMIS). We applied univariate, bivariate, and trivariate spatial heat maps to assess contraceptive and vaccine stock levels, dispensation/vaccination, and wastage across districts. For contraception, we standardized stocks per 100,000 married women of reproductive age (MWRA) and dispensation rates. In immunization, we focused on Pentavalent-3 (Penta3) vaccine outreach, dropout rates, and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine wastage. Temporal and spatial variations highlighted regional disparities, revealing that developed regions like Punjab had better stock availability, while underserved areas like Balochistan faced higher dispensation rates and stockouts. We also show the effect of inputs (supplies, outreach) on dispensation and utilization of contraceptives and vaccines, respectively. Finally, we depict how these visualizations can help track changes in programming over time. Our findings show that integrating spatial data visualization with health logistics data identifies critical gaps in health service supply and demand, guiding policymakers in resource allocation, stock management, and service outreach. This scalable approach suits systems with limited analytical resources, as many analyses can be automated and embedded in datasets, providing policymakers with a focused set of visualizations for interpretation, avoiding the need for extensive training or deploying analysis teams at local levels. By leveraging spatial and temporal data, this method supports efficient health system strengthening and resource allocation in LMIC.",Ibrahim M; Naz O; Mohiuddin AF; Rehman HU; Khan AA,"Research and Development Solutions (RADS), Islamabad, Pakistan.",PloS one,2025-09-26,10.1371/journal.pone.0332394,3.8,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
40995707,"Diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy: imaging methods, challenges, and new perspectives.","Precise assessment of Graves` orbitopathy (GO) predicts therapeutic strategies. Various imaging techniques and different measurement methods are used, but there is a lack of standardization. Traditionally, the Clinical Activity Score (CAS) has been used for assessing GO, especially for evaluating disease activity to predict response to glucocorticoid (GC) therapy, but technological developments have led to a shift towards more objective imaging methods that offer accuracy. Imaging methods for Graves' orbitopathy assessment include ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). These can be divided into those that assess disease activity (MRI, SPECT) and those that assess disease severity (USG, CT, MRI, SPECT). USG is the accessible first-aid tool that provides non-invasive imaging of orbital structures, with a short time of examination making it highly suitable for initial evaluation and monitoring of GO. It does have limitations, particularly in visualizing the apex of the orbit. Initially, orbital CT was thought to provide more accurate morphological information, particularly in extraocular muscles, and superior visualization of bone structures compared to MRI, making it the imaging modality of choice prior to planned orbital decompression; however, it has difficulty in accurately assessing the inflammatory activity stages of GO. Although CT offers a better view of deeper-lying tissue, it is limited by radiation exposure. MRI is best suited for follow-up examinations because it offers superior soft tissue visualization and precise tissue differentiation. However, it is not specific for orbital changes, the examination is very expensive, and it is rarely available. Recent literature proposes that nuclear medicine imaging techniques may be the best discipline for assessing GO. SPECT fused with low-dose CT scans is now used to increase the diagnostic value of the investigation. It provides functional information on top of the anatomical images. The use of cost-effective radioisotope - technetium-99m (99mTc)-DTPA - gives great diagnostic results with short examination time, low radiation exposure, and satisfactory spatial resolution. Nowadays, 36 years after CAS development and with technological improvement, researchers aim to integrate artificial intelligence tools with SPECT/CT imaging to diagnose and stage GO activity more effectively.",Sulima I; Mitera B; Szumowski P; Myśliwiec JK,"Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Clinical Hospital in Białystok, Bialystok, Poland. i-sulima@wp.pl.",Endokrynologia Polska,2025-09-25,10.5603/ep.105785,3.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); artificial intelligence(abstract),Autoimmune diseases; Hyperthyroidism; Ultrasonography; Graves’ disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; SPECT; computed tomography; Nuclear Medicine; Graves’ Orbitopathy;  Thyroid
41006727,Theranostics in nuclear medicine: the era of precision oncology.,"Theranostics represents a transformative advancement in nuclear medicine by integrating molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy within the paradigm of personalized oncology. This review elucidates the historical evolution and contemporary clinical applications of theranostics, emphasizing its pivotal role in precision cancer management. The theranostic approach involves the coupling of diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides that target identical molecular biomarkers, enabling simultaneous visualization and treatment of malignancies such as neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), prostate cancer, and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Key theranostic radiopharmaceutical pairs, including Gallium-68-labeled DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate (Ga-68-DOTATATE) with Lutetium-177-labeled DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate (Lu-177-DOTATATE), and Gallium-68-labeled Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (Ga-68-PSMA) with Lutetium-177-labeled Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (Lu-177-PSMA), exemplify the ""see-and-treat"" principle central to this modality. This article further explores critical molecular targets such as somatostatin receptor subtype 2, prostate-specific membrane antigen, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, CD20, and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4, along with design principles for radiopharmaceuticals that optimize target specificity while minimizing off-target toxicity. Advances in imaging platforms, including positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), single-photon emission computed tomography/CT (SPECT/CT), and hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), have been instrumental in accurate dosimetry, therapeutic response assessment, and adaptive treatment planning. Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics holds promise for enhanced image segmentation, predictive modeling, and individualized dosimetric planning. The review also addresses regulatory, manufacturing, and economic considerations, including guidelines from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards, and reimbursement frameworks, which collectively influence global adoption of theranostics. In summary, theranostics is poised to become a cornerstone of next-generation oncology, catalyzing a paradigm shift toward biologically driven, real-time personalized cancer care that seamlessly links diagnosis and therapy.",Gandhi N; Alaseem AM; Deshmukh R; Patel A; Alsaidan OA; Fareed M; Alasiri G; Patel S; Prajapati B,"Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, L.

40999054,"A modified transformer based on adaptive frequency enhanced attention, large kernel convolution, and multiscale implementation for bearing fault diagnosis.","Bearing fault diagnosis has attracted increasing attention due to its critical role in monitoring the health of rotating machinery. Data-driven models based on deep learning (DL) have demonstrated strong capabilities in feature extraction. However, their performance often degrades under strong noise interference, which limits their applicability in real-world industrial scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel attention-enhanced Transformer model that integrates large-kernel convolution and multiscale CNN structures for robust fault diagnosis. The proposed framework effectively combines spatiotemporal feature modeling with adaptive frequency-domain enhancement, enabling it to suppress noise and highlight informative diagnostic features.

40957441,3D electroacoustic tomography image enhancement using deep learning with the SAM-Med3D encoder.,"<i>Objective.</i>To overcome the limitations of electroacoustic tomography (EAT) in clinical settings-particularly the artifacts and distortions caused by limited-angle data acquisition-and enable accurate, efficient visualization of electric field distributions for electroporation-based therapies.<i>Approach.</i>We developed a deep learning-based framework that enhances 3D EAT image reconstruction from single-view projections by leveraging the large foundation model (LFM) SAM-Med3D. The encoder was modified into a local-global feature fusion architecture that extracts multi-scale features from intermediate transformer layers, preserving fine structural details while maintaining computational efficiency. A lightweight decoder with progressive up-sampling and skip connections was employed to generate high-resolution images, addressing limitations of conventional U-Net architectures.<i>Main results.</i>We collected a dataset of 50 EAT scans-each with 120 views-for a total of 6000 views. These were acquired from water phantoms and tissue samples under varied electrode configurations and voltages, and split into training (30 scans, 3600 views), validation (10 scans, 1200 views), and testing (10 scans, 1200 views). Our model significantly outperformed baseline 3D U-Nets, achieving an RMSE of 0.0092, PSNR of 41.10, and SSIM of 0.9377. Remarkably, our method reconstructs a full-view 3D EAT image from a single view in just 2 s, demonstrating its potential for near real-time monitoring and adaptive dose verification in electroporation-based therapies.<i>Significance.</i>This is the first application of a LFM like SAM-Med3D for enhancing 3D EAT imaging.

41014733,Video laryngoscopy vs. direct laryngoscopy in infants and neonates: A systematic review and meta-analysis. ,"Endotracheal intubation in infants and neonates is a critical yet challenging procedure with a narrow time window. This meta-analysis aimed to compare video laryngoscopy (VL) to direct laryngoscopy (DL) regarding first-attempt success, time to intubation, and complication rates. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to June 2024, comparing VL and DL in infants less than one-year-old and neonates (defined as infants 0-28 days old). Primary outcomes included first-attempt success rate, while secondary outcomes were time to intubation (TTI) and complication rates. A subgroup analysis was performed for neonates. In our analysis of 17 RCTs with 1918 participants, VL demonstrated a higher first-attempt success rate compared to DL (87.5 % vs 78 %; OR 2.13; p < 0.001), with similar results in neonates (77.6 % vs 63 %; OR 2.12; p = 0.027). VL also improved the time to best view (MD -2.85; p < 0.01) and showed significantly better POGO scores (MD 16.8; p < 0.01). However, there was no advantage of VL over DL in reducing time to intubation (MD 0.79; p = 0.49). VL reduced complications compared to DL (2.77 % vs 8.44 %; OR 0.33; p = 0.022). This meta-analysis suggests that VL may improve first-attempt success and glottic visualization and may reduce complications compared with DL in infants and neonates. Intubation times appear similar between the two approaches. However, moderate heterogeneity, variability in VL devices, and potential operator dependence indicate that these findings should be interpreted with caution. Further clinical trials are warranted to validate these results and explore the long-term implications of VL on patient outcomes.",Salha I; Łajczak P; Silva YP; Ahmed S; Joseph T; Sahin OK; Silva R; Filardi RM,"Trinity Centre for Global Health - Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.

40996988,MTF-hERG: a Multi-type Features Fusion-based Framework for Predicting hERG Cardiotoxicity of Compounds.,"The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) cardiac toxicity of a compound refers to its inhibitory effect on the hERG potassium channel. The hERG channel is crucial for cardiac depolarization, and its blockage can lead to prolongation of the QT interval, triggering arrhythmias and posing life-threatening risks. Therefore, assessing hERG cardiac toxicity is a vital consideration in drug development. Traditional assessment methods are complex and have low throughput, making the development of deep learning models to predict this toxicity essential for enhancing drug development efficiency, reducing risks, and promoting personalized treatment. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-type feature fusion framework, MTF-hERG, for accurately predicting the cardiac toxicity of hERG compounds. This framework integrates various molecular features such as molecular fingerprints, 2D molecular images, and 3D molecular graphs to comprehensively capture the intrinsic structures and properties of compounds. By utilizing fully connected neural networks, DenseNet, and Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for feature extraction, we ensure that the model can precisely identify molecular characteristics associated with hERG blocking activity. Through deep fusion of extracted features and the construction of fully connected layers with different activation functions, we achieve classification predictions of whether a compound is an hERG blocker and regression predictions of its hERG inhibitory capacity. When comparing MTF-hERG with other state-of-the-art methods using benchmark datasets, we found that the average ACC, AUC, AUPR, RMSE, and R² values of MTF-hERG were 0.926, 0.943, 0.913, 0.453, and 0.681, respectively. The results demonstrate that MTF-hERG exhibits excellent predictive performance in various scenarios, significantly outperforming the existing baseline models. Furthermore, the visualization results of MTF-hERG not only reveal the key features and decision mechanisms of the model but also provide valuable support for further optimization of molecular structures. Therefore, the MTF-hERG framework is poised to become a powerful tool for predicting the hERG cardiac toxicity of compounds, offering robust support for drug development and exerting a profound impact on human health.",Liu L; Zhang Q; Wei Y,,IEEE transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,2025-09-25,10.1109/tcbbio.2025.3614696,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40987202,Association between omega-3 fatty acid intake and risk of diabetic retinopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Diabetic Retinopathy is a significant microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by progressive damage to the retinal vasculature. Current management strategies focus on modifying risk factors and treating established disease. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) demonstrate anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and vasculoprotective properties.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the protective effects of omega-3 fatty acids on DR incidence, progression, and microvascular health across diverse diabetic populations.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive literature search was conducted via PubMed, EBSCO Open Research, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, and Google Scholar. A reviewer screened the potential articles against prespecified eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in the eligible studies was then evaluated using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS), a Risk of Bias visualization tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration (ROB 2.0). Data were then systematically extracted and analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>Fourteen studies involving 139,879 participants were analyzed. Omega-3 fatty acid intake of ≥500 mg/day significantly reduced the risk of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR) by 48% (HR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.31-0.88; p = 0.001). Subgroup meta-analysis showed a stronger associated protective effect in type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to type 1 (T1D), with a pooled hazard ratio of 0.71 (log HR = -0.339; SE = 0.0667; p < 0.000001). The antioxidant benefits were linked by a pooled mean difference of -1.399 in oxidative stress markers (MDA/TBARS) (95% CI: -1.432 to -1.366; Z = 83.29; p < 0.00001), with no significant heterogeneity (I² = 0%). Further stratification showed robust effects in both RCTs (HR = 0.743; p = 0.002) and non-RCTs (HR = 0.514; p = 0.005). These findings support omega-3s-especially in T2D-as a non-pharmacologic intervention for DR prevention, likely through anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective mechanisms.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Omega-3 fatty acid intake is associated with dose-dependent protection against diabetic retinopathy, with the greatest benefits from whole food sources, optimal omega-6/omega-3 ratios, and in well-controlled T2D patients.",Chen KY; Chan HC; Chan CM,"School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of General Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Linkou Branch), Taoyuan, Taiwan.","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2025-09-22,10.1016/j.jnha.2025.100632,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Eicosapentaenoic acid; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Docosahexaenoic acid; Diabetic retinopathy; Diabetes Mellitus.; Omega-3 Fatty Acids
41015446,[Endoscopic transorbital approach to the orbital apex and skull base: an applied anatomical study]. ,"Objective: To investigate the anatomical feasibility of the endoscopic transorbital approach (ETOA) to the orbital apex and lateral middle cranial fossa, to identify stable and recognizable surgical landmarks under endoscopic visualization, and to provide morphometric data for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation. Methods: Stepwise anatomical dissection was performed on five formalin-fixed cadaveric heads and one fresh arterially injected cadaveric specimen to simulate the ETOA using a 0° endoscope. Key structures and their anatomical relationships were observed and recorded. Additionally, high-resolution CT scans of 50 adults were retrospectively analyzed. Three-dimensional reconstructions and measurements were performed using Mimics 17.0 software. Spatial validation was performed using 17 dry skulls to verify the consistency and reliability of osseous anatomical landmarks. Results: Cadaveric dissection identified the meningo-orbital band, superior orbital fissure, optic canal, foramen rotundum, and foramen ovale as reliable surgical landmarks for the ETOA. A topographic map of the surgical region was established based on the endoscopic view. CT measurements revealed the following distances (Mean±SD): the midpoint of the supraorbital rim to the foramen rotundum (57.31±3.59) mm and foramen ovale (71.46±3.42) mm; the lateral orbital rim to the lateral edge of the superior orbital fissure (37.38±2.52) mm; the distance from the superior orbital fissure to the optic canal (9.98±1.49) mm; and the distance from the anterior ethmoidal artery to the optic canal (19.98±2.05) mm. These measurements were consistent with dry skull data, indicating that these osseous landmarks had stable spatial relationships and were suitable for intraoperative localization. Conclusions: The ETOA provides favorable anatomical accessibility and clinical feasibility for lesions involving the orbital apex and lateral skull base. Key osseous structures demonstrate high identifiability and stable spatial relationships, serving as critical references for intraoperative navigation and preoperative pathway planning. The quantitative anatomical framework established in this study provides critical morphometric support for minimally invasive surgery targeting lesions in this region.",Liu JM; Wen YH; Lai YY; Xu ZF; Gao WX; Zheng NZ; Li J; Wen WP,"Department of Otolaryngology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Otorhinolaryngology, Otorhinolaryngology Institute of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.",Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,2025-09-26,10.3760/cma.j.cn115330-20250407-00210,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41014455,Surgical proficiency of trainee surgeons on robotic platforms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Robotic-assisted surgery has transformed minimally invasive procedures by enhancing precision, dexterity, and visualization. However, it presents unique psychomotor and cognitive challenges that traditional surgical training often fails to address. Simulation-based platforms such as the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS) and SimNow are widely implemented, yet a universally accepted standard for assessing robotic surgical proficiency remains elusive. Commonly used evaluation tools-GEARS, OSATS, and expert assessments-vary in standardization and applicability. To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize current evidence on simulation-based robotic surgical training in trainees, focusing on proficiency assessment tools, learning curve thresholds, and skill transfer from conventional surgical techniques. A systematic search of five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) was performed up to June 2025. Eligible studies included trainee populations assessed using validated robotic simulators or evaluation metrics. Data extraction followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis. Fourteen studies including 652 surgical trainees met the inclusion criteria. Simulation-based training significantly improved performance on GEARS (SMD 1.22, 95% CI 0.96-1.49) and OSATS (SMD 1.08, 95% CI 0.82-1.34). Task completion times (SMD -0.95) and error rates (SMD-1.03) also improved markedly. Learning curve analyses revealed performance plateaus between 15 and 35 sessions (median: 22). Subgroup analyses showed comparable efficacy between dVSS and SimNow simulators. Skill transfer from laparoscopic surgery showed a moderate effect (SMD ~ 0.40), while no significant benefit was observed from open surgical experience. The integration of expert-defined proficiency thresholds and real-time feedback accelerated skill acquisition and improved self-efficacy scores. Simulation-based training significantly enhances robotic surgical proficiency, especially when integrated with validated metrics and expert feedback. A competency-based framework incorporating performance analytics and learning curve insights is essential for effective training.

41004845,"Clinical validation of a rapid, markerless, headset-contained augmented reality stereotactic neuronavigation system. ","Digital enhancement and visualization technologies, such as augmented reality (AR), are increasingly used in surgery. Rapid and accurate patient registration with minimal device confinements enables AR systems to increase efficiency, safety, and effectiveness, especially in urgent/emergency and/or bedside scenarios. The aim of this study was to quantitatively compare an AR headset-based neuronavigation system with a standard-of-care reference array-based neurosurgical stereotactic navigation system in a real-world setting. This clinical validation trial included adult patients undergoing cranial neurosurgery with stereotactic navigation at a single center from February 2024 to July 2024. Preoperative CT and MR images were acquired and used for construction of a 3D hologram model that included surface-based target fiducial markers for comparison. Preoperative images were stereotactically registered to the patient's head using standard techniques. The registration coordinates for the fiducial markers (control) and registration time were recorded. The AR system was then deployed to create a separate stereotactic registration to the same preoperative images. A second set of registration coordinates for the fiducial markers (experimental) were acquired using the AR system, and the time for this process was also recorded. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess differences in registration time, and a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to conduct equivalence testing of coordinates between the control and experimental data. Twenty patients (mean age ± SD 50.05 ± 14.38 years) were included in the trial. The mean baseline validation error of the control system was 0.73 ± 0.29 mm (range 0-1.0 mm). Using the control system as ground truth, the mean registration accuracy of the AR system was 2.16 ± 0.12 mm. LMM equivalence testing, conducted with margins of 3 mm and 2.5 mm, demonstrated statistical equivalence between the ground truth and AR system coordinates (p < 0.001 and p < 0.003, respectively). The time required for patient model registration using the AR system was a mean of 45.98 ± 15.00 seconds, which was significantly shorter compared with the control system (228.86 ± 100.06 seconds, p < 0.001). The AR navigation system provided statistically similar registration accuracy and significantly faster patient model registration compared with the standard-of-care stereotactic neuronavigation system. AR navigation was accurate, fast, and had a minimal footprint, offering new opportunities to incorporate stereotaxis in low-resource, bedside, and urgent/emergency settings.",Olexa J; Chen C; Rastogi P; Sansur C; Rakovec M; Saadon JR; Stokum J; Kim KT; Yarmoska SK; Trang A; Wang T; Cherian J; Labib M; Ksendzovsky A; Solomon CT; Parker W; Schwartzbauer G; Woodworth GF,"1Department of Neurosurgery, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore.",Journal of neurosurgery,2025-09-26,10.3171/2025.5.jns243160,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
41013216,Establishment and validation of a recurrent prediction model for glioma: extrinsic apoptotic molecules FADD and CASP8 are closely associated with glioma recurrence.,"<h4>Background</h4>Glioma represents the most prevalent and aggressive primary brain tumor in humans. Tumor heterogeneity, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and therapeutic resistance contribute to the inevitable recurrence of gliomas, posing significant clinical challenges. Understanding the risk factors and molecular mechanisms underlying glioma recurrence and progression is critical for improving patient outcomes. In this study, we aimed to develop a recurrence-associated gene signature to predict clinical recurrence and survival outcomes while elucidating potential molecular mechanisms driving glioma recurrence.<h4>Methods</h4>Gene expression profiles and clinicopathological data were obtained from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) database. The CGGA-693 cohort served as the training set, while the CGGA-325 cohort and TCGA database were used for validation. A prognostic model was constructed using LASSO regression analysis. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were employed to assess prognostic significance. Functional enrichment analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO), Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), and Pearson correlation analysis, were conducted to explore biological pathways. We applied the T-test to analyze the expression levels of apoptotic molecules in primary versus recurrent gliomas, low-grade versus high-grade gliomas, as well as in the high versus low recurrence score groups. Furthermore, correlation analysis was performed to elucidate the relationship between six classic apoptotic genes and the recurrence score. By utilizing the STRING protein-interaction network, we systematically investigated the correlations between these six classic apoptotic genes and the 9-gene signature. RNA expression levels of CASP8 and FADD across various tissues were obtained from the NCBI database and the Human Protein Atlas database. Additionally, the protein levels of CASP8 and FADD in normal brain tissues were retrieved from the Human Protein Atlas database. Statistical analyses and visualization were performed using R software.<h4>Results</h4>A 9-gene recurrence-associated signature (AC062021.1, CCT7P2, CTB-1I21.1, DGCR6, RP11- 158M2.5, SLC22A6, SLC25A48, ADAM12, and FAM225B) was established, demonstrating robust predictive performance. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the recurrence score serves as an independent prognostic factor for glioma patients. Functional annotation revealed a significant association between the signature and apoptotic pathways. Subsequent analysis indicated that extrinsic apoptosis-related molecules (FADD and CASP8), rather than intrinsic apoptotic molecules (BCL2 and CASP9), were strongly correlated with glioma recurrence. Additionally, we characterized the expression patterns of key extrinsic apoptotic mediators, FADD and CASP8, in both normal and tumor tissues.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study successfully developed a predictive model based on 9 recurrence-related genes, enabling accurate stratification of glioma patients into high- and low-risk recurrence groups. Furthermore, we identified apoptosis, particularly the extrinsic apoptotic pathway involving FADD and CASP8, as a critical mechanism associated with glioma recurrence.

40910754,"SmokePath Explorer - a data driven smoke management tool to support prescribed fire planning in California, USA.","SmokePath Explorer is a web-based decision-support tool for California, U.S.A. that quantifies smoke transport probability and population exposure risk across the state, enabling data-driven strategies to minimize impacts while advancing fire management effectiveness. SmokePath integrates the California and Nevada Smoke and Air Committee (CANSAC) high-resolution (2-km) 20-year reanalysis climatology with HYSPLIT trajectory modeling. A total of 1.3 billion transport trajectories were precomputed with initializations four times per day at four distinct height levels capturing diurnal variations and injection height influences across various prescribed fire scenarios to support probabilistic smoke projections. Within the SmokePath online dashboard, users can input fire parameters and select specific months or weeks to assess smoke transport risk. The tool generates risk-level smoke transport contours from precomputed data and summarizes key meteorological variables. The system also provides population exposure estimates, including the total affected population, the number of smoke-sensitive facilities (i.e. educational and healthcare), and impacted USPS ZIP codes. User feedback has been key to developing SmokePath, enhancing usability, data integration, and decision-making for prescribed fire planning. To assess SmokePath's efficacy, we conducted case studies across diverse regions and validated results against independent observation datasets. These use cases assessed the accuracy of the WRF-CANSAC reanalysis dataset, which serves as the meteorological input for fire weather climatology and trajectory modeling. The fire case studies focused on identifying optimal burn windows and quantifying smoke transport patterns from (i) large multi-day prescribed fires, (ii) short duration (single-day) pile burns, and (iii) burns across diverse regions with complex topographic features. In most cases, modeled transport probability aligned with satellite-observed smoke plumes, capturing predominant dispersion patterns. Stakeholder feedback further supported the tool's practical utility - 85% indicated they would use SmokePath for prescribed fire planning, and 62% found it useful during wildfires.<i>Implications</i>: With catastrophic wildfires on the rise, California is expanding fuel treatments, including prescribed fire. While essential for mitigation, prescribed burns release smoke that can harm public health if unmanaged. SmokePath addresses this challenge by providing evidence-based insights on plume behavior to guide short- and long-term planning. The tool helps land managers schedule burns to minimize community impact, especially for vulnerable populations, and supports wildfire response with rapid smoke risk information. By improving public communication and enabling protective actions, SmokePath advances both health protection and the strategic use of prescribed fire.",Zare-Harofteh A; Kramer SJ; Huang S; Scarborough CR; Besong K; Kumar N; Brown T; Hosseinpour F,"Division of Atmospheric Sciences, Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV, USA.",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995),2025-09-25,10.1080/10962247.2025.2553822,2.8,"dashboard(abstract); data(title,abstract)",
40993313,"BougieCap-Assisted Endoscopic Dilation of Postoperative Strictures in Metabolic Bariatric Surgery at a High-Volume Center in Tijuana, Mexico: A Preliminary Case Series.","<h4>Background</h4>Postoperative strictures are a common complication following metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS), often requiring endoscopic intervention. Traditional endoscopic management, such as pneumatic balloon dilation, has demonstrated high success rates but may necessitate multiple sessions and carries risks of complications. BougieCap-assisted dilation has emerged as a novel approach that enables progressive dilation under direct visualization, potentially improving procedural control and clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BougieCap-assisted dilation in a high-volume MBS center.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective analysis was conducted, including patients with postoperative strictures exclusively treated with BougieCap-assisted dilation. Demographic variables, type of surgery (primary vs. revision), BougieCap size, number of sessions required, and clinical resolution were assessed. Statistical comparisons were performed to evaluate the association between dilation parameters and clinical outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 14 patients were included, with a mean age of 40.8 ± 12.3 years and a BMI of 34.6 ± 7.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The mean number of sessions required for stricture resolution was 1.3 ± 0.8, with no significant difference between primary and revision procedures (p = 1.0). BougieCap size did not significantly impact the number of dilation sessions required (p = 0.62). Complete resolution of the stricture was achieved in all cases, with symptom resolution confirmed at follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BougieCap-assisted dilation is a safe and effective technique for managing postoperative strictures after MBS, providing precise control and direct visualization. While preliminary results are promising, comparative studies are necessary to determine the relative efficacy and safety of BougieCap-assisted dilation compared to conventional techniques.

40973460,Photon-Counting Computed Tomography for Evaluation of Coiled Intracranial Aneurysms.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Intracranial aneurysms treated with endovascular embolization often require surveillance imaging using digital subtraction angiography, an invasive, risky, and expensive procedure. Existing non-invasive imaging modalities (standard computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance [MR] angiography) are often unsatisfactory for evaluating treated aneurysm due to artifacts from embolization devices. The objective of the present study was to determine whether photon-counting computer tomography (PCCT) imaging parameters could be optimized to confer satisfactory imaging resolution in an anthropomorphic phantom of treated intracranial aneurysms.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Phantom studies were performed using a model of the major intracranial arteries with appropriately sized, endovascularly treated middle cerebral artery (coil embolization) and basilar artery (woven endobridge [WEB] embolization) aneurysms. A series of imaging acquisition procedures were performed using a conventional energy-integrating CT (EICT) scanner and a photon-counting CT (PCCT) scanner. Key imaging acquisition and reconstruction parameters were varied to identify the optimum protocol for treated aneurysm characterization. Artifact reduction was performed on all images using the Siemens iterative metal artifact reduction (iMAR) algorithm. Contrast-to-noise ratio and metal artifact magnitude were quantitatively analyzed and displayed in tabular form to provide objective criteria for determination of optimal processing parameters for treated aneurysm visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Imaging was successfully obtained in phantom studies across a range of imaging parameters. Quantitative metal artifact magnitude was greater for 100keV virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) and lowest for 55 keV VMIs without iMAR, but this trend was reversed with iMAR applied. The 55 keV VMI was chosen as the optimal reconstruction parameter for visualization of treated intracranial aneurysms as it demonstrated low magnitude of metal artifacts and the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in adjacent vasculature. Similarly, CNR of the largest vessel adjacent to the coil mass was increased for all images after iMAR was applied. CNR was highest in the 55 keV VMR images both before (3.61±0.14) and after (6.82±0.34) application of iMAR.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Virtual monoenergetic images combined with metal artifact reduction algorithms created from PCCT scans conferred excellent visualization of previously-treated intracranial aneurysms and adjacent vasculature.

Although histological examination of liver tissue biopsies continues to serve as the most reliable diagnostic approach, the development of precise detection methods remains crucial for enabling timely therapeutic interventions and improving patient management. Recent advances in fluorescent probes have transformed the detection of liver fibrosis, enabling real-time, non-invasive visualization of biomarkers and microenvironmental changes. Based on its design strategy, targeted objects and functional characteristics, this review systematically classifies state-of-the-art fluorescent probes into five categories: probes directly targeting liver fibrosis markers, enzyme-activated probes, microenvironment-responsive probes, intracellular targeting probes, and multifunctional theranostic probes. Among them, near-infrared II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) imaging and genetically encoded probes boost molecular precision and resolution, yet clinical application faces challenges from limited tissue penetration and poor biocompatibility. Consequently, future research in this field will concentrate on the development of NIR II probes, the discovery of biomarkers in biofluids, and the design of new therapeutic interventions. By elucidating design principles and applications, this review aims to bridge the gap between molecular innovation and clinical practice, ultimately advancing precision medicine for liver fibrosis.",Lv Y; Ma Z; Chong Y; Wang Z; Xue L; Wang F,"Department of Urology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710004, China. zhenlongw2001@xjtu.edu.cn.",Materials horizons,2025-09-26,10.1039/d5mh01447f,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40984808,Ultrasound-Guided vs. Conventional Needle Puncture: A Comparative Study of Success Rates.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aims to compare the puncture success rates and procedural efficiency between ultrasound-guided and conventional (non-ultrasound) methods in laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) to evaluate the clinical benefits of ultrasound guidance.<h4>Methods</h4>A self-controlled study design was used in this research. Nineteen patients underwent LEMG using both conventional and ultrasound-guided techniques. In the conventional method, the laryngologist performed needle punctures in the cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid muscles based on experience, with ultrasound only observing and recording. In the ultrasound-guided method, the sonologist actively guided the laryngologist during the needle puncture. Puncture success rates and examination times were compared between the two techniques, while electromyographic recordings were analyzed by neurophysiologists.<h4>Results</h4>Ultrasound successfully visualized all cricothyroid muscles (38 sides) and thyroarytenoid muscles (38 sides). Compared to the conventional method, Ultrasound-guided LEMG achieved a higher success rate (97.43% vs. 88.15%, p < 0.05, Chi-square test) and reduced examination time (3.81 ± 0.61 min vs. 5.54 ± 0.52 min, p < 0.001, Paired t-tests).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ultrasound can provide detailed visualization of the laryngeal structures.

A total of 111 DH students, 41 juniors, and 70 seniors. All participating students and 20 faculty were randomized into control or intervention groups, in which there were 54 and 57 students, respectively. Eight study team examiners calibrated and used the PE. The intervention group faculty received endoscopic visualization of calculus to deliver endoscope guided (EG) feedback, while the control group received the clinical standard procedure from their designated faculty.<h4>Results</h4>Agreement between the calculus index of students and examiners and of faculty and examiners was estimated using weighted kappa statistics. The intervention group demonstrated a statistically significant difference (0.014) for calculus removal compared to the control group. For the post calculus detection and removal, the intervention group had a higher kappa for all surfaces compared to the control group: mesial surfaces, (intervention 0.158, control 0.002), distal surfaces (intervention 0.108, control 0.034), buccal surfaces (intervention 0.169, control 0.139), and lingual surfaces (intervention 0.134, control 0.070). The intervention group detected and removed more calculus than the control group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study represented the first known three-DH program clinical trial to implement innovative technology to enhance student performance.

40986188,Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve Radiofrequency Ablation for Meralgia Paresthetica: A Description of a Novel Technique.,"Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is neuropathic pain in the anterolateral thigh, most often caused by compression or injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). Conservative treatments include weight loss, avoidance of compressive clothing, medical management with anti-inflammatory and neuropathic agents, and corticosteroid injections. For patients with MP refractory to these measures, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive option that may provide pain relief. This article introduces a novel ultrasound-guided continuous RFA technique designed to create a controlled thermal lesion of the LFCN, along with preliminary clinical outcomes. Pronounced anatomic variation of the LFCN at the anterior superior iliac spine makes real-time imaging essential for procedural accuracy, with ultrasound offering consistent nerve visualization and precise needle placement. Continuous RFA has demonstrated substantial and durable reductions in VAS scores, whereas pulsed RFA provides shorter-term relief with a favorable safety profile, and cooled RFA produces broader lesions that may help address anatomical variability, although supporting evidence is limited. Overall, RFA can be an effective treatment for MP refractory to conservative therapy, with optimal results dependent on detailed anatomical knowledge and accurate image guidance, particularly when using the novel continuous RFA approach described in this study.",Abd-Elsayed A; Sahin MZ; Shiferaw BT,"Department of Anesthesiology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, 600 Highland Avenue, B6/319 CSC, Madison, WI, 53792-3272, USA. alaaawny@hotmail.com.",Advances in therapy,2025-09-23,10.1007/s12325-025-03360-y,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Meralgia Paresthetica; Radiofrequency Ablation; Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve
40986317,Evaluation of inferior alveolar artery and its variations using three-dimensional rotational angiography.,"PurposeThis study aims to evaluate the morphological features and branching patterns of the inferior alveolar artery (IAA) in living individuals using three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D-RA) and to propose a novel radiological classification based on its shape and branching pattern.MethodsA total of 101 hemifaces (53 right, 34 males/34 females) underwent 3D-RA imaging (slice thickness:0.10-0.20 mm). Morphological assessments of the maxillary artery (MA) and the IAA were performed on maximum intensity projection images. Statistical analysis used IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 (<i>p</i> < 0.05).ResultsMean diameters of the internal carotid artery (ICA), external carotid artery (ECA), and MA were 4.62 ± 0.58 mm, 3.60 ± 0.87 mm, and 2.35 ± 0.41 mm, respectively. Females exhibited significantly smaller ICA, ECA, and MA diameters (<i>p</i> = 0.036, 0.001, 0.001), while IAA diameter (0.95 ± 0.19 mm) showed no sex difference. The IAA originated predominantly from the MA (96%), rarely from the ECA (4%), or was not observed (1%). Duplicated IAAs were detected in two cases. Branching patterns included a single vessel (71%) or a shared trunk with the posterior deep temporal artery (29%), showing significant correlation with MA course (superficial/deep) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). IAA shapes were categorized as straight, curved, or looped, addressing a literature gap.ConclusionsThis is the first in vivo study to radiologically classify variations of the IAA using 3D-RA. The technique enables high-resolution visualization of submillimeter vessels, offering valuable anatomical insights for maxillofacial surgeries.

40999614,Reduced Field-of-view Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Detecting Early Gastric Cancer: A Pilot Study Comparing Diagnostic Performance with MDCT and fFOV DWI.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Early detection of gastric cancer remains challenging for many of the current imaging techniques. Recent advancements in reduced field-of-view (rFOV) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have shown promise in improving the visualization of small anatomical structures. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance of rFOV DWI with multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and conventional full field of view (fFOV) DWI for detecting early gastric cancer (EGC).<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study included 43 patients with pathologically confirmed EGC. All participants underwent pre-treatment imaging, including CT scans and MRI with a prototype rFOV DWI and conventional fFOV DWI at 3 Tesla. Quantitative (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) and qualitative (subjective image quality) assessments were performed. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis.<h4>Results</h4>rFOV DWI demonstrated significantly higher SNR and CNR compared with fFOV DWI (P < 0.05). Subjective image quality scores were also superior for rFOV DWI (P < 0.05). In lesion detection, rFOV DWI showed higher sensitivity (0.705) than CT (0.636) and fFOV DWI (0.523). ROC analysis revealed that rFOV DWI had a higher AUC (0.829, 95% CI [0.764, 0.882]) than fFOV DWI (0.734, 95% CI [0.661, 0.798], P = 0.02) and a modest improvement over CT (0.799, 95% CI [0.731, 0.856], P = 0.51).<h4>Discussion</h4>The findings suggest that rFOV DWI provides superior image quality and diagnostic accuracy for EGC detection compared with conventional fFOV DWI. While it showed a trend toward better performance than CT, further studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate these results.<h4>Conclusion</h4>rFOV DWI offers improved image quality and diagnostic performance for early gastric cancer detection compared with fFOV DWI, with a potential advantage over CT. This technique may enhance early diagnosis and clinical decision-making in gastric cancer management.",Song G; Wang G; Li L; Shang L; Duan S; Wang Z; Liu Y,"Department of Radiology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, China.",Current medical imaging,2025-09-24,10.2174/0115734056390767250917221319,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Diffusion-weighted Imaging; Early Gastric Cancer; Computed Tomography.; Reduced Field-of-view; Full Field-of-view
40998389,Advances in Proximity-Assisted Bioconjugation.,"ConspectusProximity-induced chemistry (PIC) refers to the transient reactivity between two or more molecules upon physical closeness which are otherwise unreactive. Harnessed by nature to control fundamental biological processes such as transcription and signal transduction, PIC increases the probability of correctly oriented, effective collisions, facilitating fundamental cellular processes. Within the field of chemical biology, PIC has been employed for several clinically relevant purposes, including the degradation of aberrant biomolecules and construction of protein therapeutics. This Account focuses on the application of PIC strategies for the development of site-specific bioconjugation techniques, termed proximity-assisted bioconjugation (PAB). Site-specific bioconjugation refers to the precise modification of biomolecules to generate homogeneous products. Such techniques are vital for the development of protein therapeutics including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the investigation of the biological mechanisms of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and the visualization of biomolecular interactions <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. While numerous strategies have been developed, many suffer from poor yields, limited product stability, demanding experimental procedures, and/or a lack of regioselectivity. Thus, PIC principles have been implemented to address these limitations, leading to the development of PAB strategies which achieve precise, regioselective modification of biomolecules. In this Account, we describe the development of PAB techniques within our group at the University of Cambridge and Instituto de Medicina Molecular (iMM) over the past five years. Our journey with PAB began serendipitously while investigating maleic acid derivatives for cysteine bioconjugation. Here, we discovered the secondary participation of proximal lysines on Trastuzumab-V205C and Gemtuzumab-V205C, conjugatable THIOMAB antibodies commonly used in ADCs, leading to the formation of distinct bioconjugate products relative to IgGs without such lysines. Further investigation into the proximal lysine (K207) of Trastuzumab-V205C revealed that residue 207 could be harnessed directly or mutated to precisely tune the stability of ADCs due to proximity interactions between K207 and covalent modifications of C205. Considering that two Trastuzumab drug conjugates are approved for clinical use, these findings have contributed to the evolving understanding of the chemical landscape of this antibody and help inform future ADC design and development. Further, we describe efforts from our group to develop two distinct PAB approaches: regioselective lysine acetylation of histone H3 and phage display-compatible peptide cyclization. These strategies combine induced-proximity with traditional bioconjugation techniques to enable regioselective modification of biomolecules which are historically difficult to selectively modify. These methods are readily adaptable to related systems and serve as representative examples of how to successfully develop PAB strategies for desired applications. In short, this Account highlights our group's contributions to and insights on PAB methodologies wherein we illustrate how PIC can be thoughtfully applied to bioconjugation techniques for various aims including regioselective bioconjugation and enhanced bioconjugate stability. We expect that PAB approaches will continue to diversify bioconjugation applications and greatly expand the toolkit of chemical biologists.",Canzano M; Bernardes GJL,"Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, CB2 1EW, Cambridge U.K.",Accounts of chemical research,2025-09-25,10.1021/acs.accounts.5c00368,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40986852,Home-Based Exercise to Improve Functional Outcomes in Veterans With a Recently Healed Diabetic Foot Ulcer: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>Foot ulcers are a common complication of diabetes, often resulting from peripheral neuropathy and inadvertent trauma. Poor healing is exacerbated by peripheral arterial disease and poor glycemic control. Off-loading, a key treatment, leads to prolonged immobility. Patients rarely regain baseline mobility. Mobility is crucial to improve glycemia, promote vascular health, and improve immobility as it leads to nursing home admissions. There is limited research on exercise during ulcer remission.<h4>Objective</h4>This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based exercise regimen aimed at safely increasing mobility and function, focusing on improving lower extremity strength, tissue perfusion, and glycemic control.<h4>Methods</h4>Veterans aged ≥50 years with a recently healed diabetic plantar foot ulcer receiving care in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Maryland Health Care System and enrolled in a remote temperature-sensing mat program will be eligible. Potential participants will be identified via administrative codes used for the Prevention of Amputation in Veterans Everywhere directive, as well as using the VA's Podimetrics SmartMat dashboard. In this pilot study, 25 veterans will be randomized (in a 3:1 ratio) to a 12-week home-based exercise regimen or standard of care. Participants will undergo tests for gait speed, knee extension strength, cutaneous perfusion, and community mobility. The intervention group will participate in internet-based videoconference exercise classes twice a week led by the study team and home cycling 3 times a week. The control group will receive standard-of-care guidance. Outcome measures will include feasibility; acceptability; and changes in gait speed, physical activity levels, and strength.<h4>Results</h4>This study was funded on July 1, 2024, with data collection planned from October 1, 2024, to March 31, 2026. The protocol was approved by the University of Maryland Institutional Review Board on May 13, 2024, and by the Baltimore VA Research and Development Committee on June 13, 2024. As of June 12, 2025, 12 participants have been enrolled in the study, and 6 (50%) participants have been randomized. Recruitment is expected to continue through December 2025.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This project has potential for clinical rehabilitation translation. If it is found to be feasible and acceptable, the exercise intervention will be tested in a future multisite randomized clinical trial to assess its impact on mobility, cardiovascular events, and ulcer recurrence.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06312579; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06312579.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/71237.",Robinson GL; Drumheller J; Lydecker AD; Rammling B; Dennis EA; Addison O; Prior SJ; Beamer BA; Sorkin JD; Gottlieb HD; Trent K; Roghmann MC,"VA Maryland Health Care System, Baltimore, MD, United States.",JMIR research protocols,2025-09-23,10.2196/71237,2.0,dashboard(abstract); data(abstract),Rehabilitation; Diabetes; Exercise; Clinical Trial; Veteran; Diabetic Foot Ulcer; Foot Ulcer; Home-based Exercise; Diabetic Foot Ulcer Recurrence
40993528,Investigating the needs of older adults with type 2 diabetes and conceptualizing a healthy diet management application: a conceptual design.,"<h4>Background</h4>The growing prevalence of diabetes among the older adults has made effective dietary management essential for controlling blood glucose levels and reducing complications. In the age of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart applications and product designs are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for supporting personalized health management and enhancing quality of life. However, most existing mobile health solutions fail to accommodate the specific cognitive and physical needs of older adults with type 2 diabetes. This study aims to explore these unique needs to inform the development of a healthy diet compliance solution tailored to this population.<h4>Methods</h4>A qualitative interview approach was employed to investigate the dietary management needs, behaviors, and technological preferences of older adults users. Twelve older adults with type 2 diabetes, aged 60 to 74 years (average age 66.7), participated in interviews conducted at a government hospital. Data were analyzed using ATLAS.ti software to identify key themes, which informed the conceptual design of a targeted healthy diet management application.<h4>Results</h4>The findings highlight five critical areas for diabetes care in older adults: diabetes knowledge, glucose monitoring, diet planning, physical activity. Based on these insights, a conceptual app prototype was developed, featuring educational content, simplified glucose tracking tools, personalised meal planning, and integration with activity monitoring. The app design prioritises accessibility, incorporating elderly-friendly elements such as large text, camera picture assistance, and intuitive navigation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study highlights the potential of tailored mobile applications to support older adults with type 2 diabetes in managing their health more effectively. The proposed application design responds directly to the specific usability needs of this demographic. Future work should include iterative prototyping and user testing to enhance usability and assess real-world impact.",Li J; Me RC; Fakhruddin NNINM; Ahmad FA; Zhu Q,"Department of Industrial Design, Faculty of Design and Architecture, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.",BMC geriatrics,2025-09-24,10.1186/s12877-025-06265-1,0.5,data(abstract),Healthy diet; Conceptual Design; Design Needs; Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes; App Design
