40764519,A decentralized privacy-preserving XR system for 3D medical data visualization using hybrid biometric cryptosystem.,"In the era of digital healthcare, accurate and secure 3D visualization of medical data is critical for collaborative surgical planning. Traditional centralized systems suffer from security vulnerabilities and lack of depth cues necessary for accurate visualization of complex anatomy. We present a decentralized Extended Reality (XR)-based framework integrating a Hybrid Biometric Cryptosystem (HBC), hierarchical redactable blockchain, and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)-based storage to address these limitations. The HBC combines leveled Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Fuzzy Vault (FV) schemes for privacy-preserving multimodal biometric authentication. A hierarchical blockchain ensures tamper-resistance, consensus-based redactions, and secure access control. Photorealistic, spatially registered 3D models of brain MRI data are rendered in Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR), enabling intuitive surgical planning. Edge caching accelerates data retrieval, enabling real-time interaction. Real-world deployment on Android and HoloLens 2 platforms demonstrates the clinical utility and robustness of the proposed framework. Security analysis confirms resistance to security threats such as replay, spoofing, etc, and unauthorized redactions. We achieve Equal Error Rates (EER) of 0.53% in AR and 0.68% in MR environments, with average authentication latency under 530 ms. A structured user study involving 40 clinicians confirms the system's clinical utility, usability, and compliance with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations. Therefore, the proposed framework offers a scalable, secure, and immersive platform for collaborative medical data visualization in digital healthcare.",Sharma S; Das D; Chaudhury S,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Jodhpur, India. shreyanshsharma665@gmail.com.",Scientific reports,2025-08-05,10.1038/s41598-025-08784-8,13.8,"visualization(kw,title,abstract); visual(kw,title,abstract); data(kw,title,abstract)",HBc; Xr; Redactable Blockchain; 3D Medical Data Visualization; Privacy-preserving Healthcare

40774333,Advancing Real-World Evidence Through a Federated Health Data Network (EHDEN): Descriptive Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Real-world data (RWD) are increasingly used in health research and regulatory decision-making to assess the effectiveness, safety, and value of interventions in routine care. However, the heterogeneity of European health care systems, data capture methods, coding standards, and governance structures poses challenges for generating robust and reproducible real-world evidence. The European Health Data & Evidence Network (EHDEN) was established to address these challenges by building a large-scale federated data infrastructure that harmonizes RWD across Europe.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to describe the composition and characteristics of the databases harmonized within EHDEN as of September 2024. We seek to provide transparency regarding the types of RWD available and their potential to support collaborative research and regulatory use.<h4>Methods</h4>EHDEN recruited data partners through structured open calls. Selected data partners received funding and technical support to harmonize their data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM), with assistance from certified small-to-medium enterprises trained through the EHDEN Academy. Each data source underwent an extract-transform-load process and data quality assessment using the data quality dashboard. Metadata-including country, care setting, capture method, and population criteria-were compiled in the publicly accessible EHDEN Portal.<h4>Results</h4>As of September 1, 2024, the EHDEN Portal includes 210 harmonized data sources from 30 countries. The highest representation comes from Italy (13%), Great Britain (12.5%), and Spain (11.5%). The mean number of persons per data source is 2,147,161, with a median of 457,664 individuals. Regarding care setting, 46.7% (n=98) of data sources reflect data exclusively from secondary care, 42.4% (n=89) from mixed care settings (both primary and secondary), and 11% (n=23) from primary care only. In terms of population inclusion criteria, 55.7% (n=117) of data sources include individuals based on health care encounters, 32.9% (n=69) through disease-specific data collection, and 11.4% (n=24) via population-based sources. Data capture methods also vary, with electronic health records (EHRs) being the most common. A total of 74.7% (n=157) of data sources use EHRs, and more than half of those (n=85) rely on EHRs as their sole method of data collection. Laboratory data are used in 29.5% (n=62) of data sources, although only one relies exclusively on laboratory data. Most laboratory-based data sources combine this method with other forms of data capture.<h4>Conclusions</h4>EHDEN is the largest federated health data network in Europe, enabling standardized, General Data Protection Regulation-compliant analysis of RWD across diverse care settings and populations. This descriptive summary of the network's data sources enhances transparency and supports broader efforts to scale federated research. These findings demonstrate EHDEN's potential to enable collaborative studies and generate trusted evidence for public health and regulatory purposes.",Blacketer C; Schuemie MJ; Moinat M; Voss EA; Camprubi M; Rijnbeek PR; Ryan PB,"OHDSI Collaborators, New York, NY, United States.",Journal of medical Internet research,2025-08-07,10.2196/74119,10.3,"dashboard(abstract); data(kw,title,abstract); informatics(kw); electronic health record(kw,abstract)",epidemiology; Data Quality; Registries; Health Informatics; Electronic Health Records; Real-world Data; Data Governance
40769201,Development of a Customizable Web-Based Dashboard for Remote Blood Pressure Monitoring: Feasibility and Usability Implementation Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Effective blood pressure (BP) management is essential for several disease states, including secondary stroke prevention. Remote BP monitoring used in combination with an electronic data capture (EDC) system offers potential for improved BP control for patients. While such systems currently exist, there are many patient-, provider-, and system-specific challenges these systems currently do not address. In addition, such systems are rarely described transparently and comprehensively in the literature with enough detail to be reproduced by other clinicians.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to describe the development and design of a web-based EDC system tailored for remote BP monitoring and management to overcome common patient-, provider-, and system-specific challenges.<h4>Methods</h4>The EDC system was developed for use in the Video-based Intervention to Reduce Treatment and Outcome Disparities in Adults living with Stroke (VIRTUAL) and transient ischemic attack clinical trial, a randomized study involving adult stroke survivors receiving care for secondary stroke prevention. The EDC system supports remote monitoring using a BP monitor, which was specifically and methodically chosen for its suitability to the population. The EDC system integrates the data from the remote monitors into a web-based application, facilitating real-time monitoring for health care team intervention. The system includes a BP dashboard displaying time-series data, visual alerts, and email notifications for out-of-range readings. Proxy measures assessed system effectiveness in addressing patient-, provider-, and system-specific needs.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen BP monitors were evaluated, and the BlipcareBlip BP800 was selected based on its cellular connectivity, ergonomic design, and application programming interface compatibility. The EDC system successfully linked patient data to the dashboard, enabling real-time visualization of BP trends and provider alerts. A total of 97% (184/190) of participants in the intervention arm engaged in BP monitoring, averaging 1.2 readings per day. Clinicians actively used the system, with mean monthly logins ranging from 19 to 44 per provider. Alerts were triggered for 69% (131/190) of participants, primarily for systolic BP abnormalities. Data transmission delays were minimal, with a median time of 1.4 minutes from data collection to dashboard entry. Outlier alerts were efficiently processed, with an average notification time of 17.9 hours. The system demonstrated high functionality in addressing patient-, provider-, and system-specific needs, supporting effective BP monitoring and intervention delivery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The VIRTUAL EDC system facilitates remote monitoring of BP in stroke survivors, offering a model for similar systems in clinical trials. Clinicians can analyze, track, and interpret monitored data in near real-time, remotely, which may enhance BP management approaches, particularly in communities with limited access to care. This approach has the potential to improve hypertension management for patients and clinicians when standard data transparency is insufficient, standard monitor features are incompatible with the user, or when integrating a commercial dashboard may threaten electronic health record security.",Wollen J; Nguyen T; Coton C; DeWildt G; Cooksey G; Cohen A; Hoang N; Okpala M; Gonzalez M; Wang M; Izeogu C; Bernstam E; Green C; Savitz S; Yamal JM; Sharrief A,"Department of Pharmacy Practice and Translational Research, College of Pharmacy, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States.",JMIR formative research,2025-08-06,10.2196/62700,9.4,"visualization(abstract); dashboard(title,abstract); visual(abstract); data(kw,abstract); electronic health record(abstract)",Development; Heart; Blood pressure; Stroke; Patient Management; Remote Monitoring; Telehealth; Electronic Data Capture; Customization; Web Based; Video Based

40768258,A Dashboard for Managing an Ecosystem and People With Dementia: Protocol for a Healthy Ageing Ecosystem for People With Dementia (HAAL) International Feasibility Pilot Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Dementia is a syndrome characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and needs. There is no cure for this syndrome, which represents a major challenge to society in terms of quality of life for those affected and in terms of workload and stress burden for those who take care of them.<h4>Objective</h4>The Healthy Ageing Ecosystem for People With Dementia (HAAL) aimed to improve the quality of life of both people with dementia and their formal caregivers (FCs) and informal caregivers (ICs) by providing a personalized set of devices to the person with dementia, along with a dashboard designed for caregivers to monitor and manage the older person.<h4>Methods</h4>The HAAL platform comprises a dashboard that integrates, aggregates, and analyzes heterogeneous data gathered from an ecosystem of devices designed for and tested with people with dementia. The study was designed as a technical feasibility pilot to test the HAAL ecosystem in 3 countries: Italy, Taiwan, and the Netherlands, where older people with initial, moderate, and severe dementia were enrolled, respectively. The study was run in 2 stages: the alpha and beta pilot studies aimed to test the second and third prototypes of the platform, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>The alpha test was conducted from March to May 2023, involving 41 end users, of which 13 were people with dementia, 13 were ICs, and 15 were FCs. The beta test was conducted from September 2023 to February 2024, involving 83 end users, of which 26 were people with dementia, 20 were ICs, and 37 were FCs. The results have been elaborated and are supposed to be published by 2026.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The HAAL pilot study was an innovative feasibility study whose primary objectives were to assess reduction in care load for FCs, stress relief for FCs and ICs, and improvement in the perceived quality of life for ICs and people with dementia. The study also evaluated the usability and the acceptance of the platform. Preliminary analyses of the results showed that the HAAL platform partially relieved caregivers' stress and that the quality of life of people with dementia did not worsen over the test period.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>RR1-10.2196/59860.",Amabili G; Maranesi E; Barbarossa F; Margaritini A; Bonfigli AR; Su FC; Lin CJ; Chieh HF; Vasseur D; Nap HH; Hsu YL; Bai D; Bevilacqua R,"Scientific Direction, IRCCS INRCA, Ancona, Italy.",JMIR research protocols,2025-08-06,10.2196/59860,7.4,"dashboard(kw,title,abstract); data(abstract)",Dementia; Older People; Ehealth; Digital Health; Dashboard; Technology For Older Adults; Innovation In Health Care
40754774,In vivo exosome imaging: applications of diverse visualization techniques.,"Exosomes-nanoscale extracellular vesicles secreted by various cell types-play a crucial role in intercellular communication by delivering biologically active molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Due to their intrinsic biocompatibility, targeting capabilities, and stability, exosomes have emerged as promising vehicles for diagnostics and therapeutics in a wide range of diseases, including cancer, and neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and autoimmune disorders. The ability to monitor exosome biodistribution and dynamics in vivo is pivotal to promoting their clinical translation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current visualization techniques employed for in vivo exosome imaging: optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and emerging modalities, such as photoacoustic imaging, ultrasound, and Raman-based approaches. The advantages, limitations, and representative applications of each imaging modality are critically discussed, with emphasis on labeling strategies that enhance tracking sensitivity and specificity. Optical imaging offers high sensitivity, but is limited by shallow tissue penetration, whereas MRI provides excellent spatial resolution, but suffers from low molecular sensitivity. Radionuclide-based imaging, such as PET and SPECT, enables highly sensitive, quantitative tracking, but presents challenges regarding radiotracer stability and safety. Emerging multimodal platforms and labeling innovations are highlighted for their potential to overcome current limitations. Future research directions include the development of non-invasive, highly sensitive, and clinically translatable imaging systems, as well as standardized protocols to ensure reproducibility. Advances in exosome imaging technologies will be instrumental to unlock the full diagnostic and therapeutic potential of exosomebased platforms in precision medicine.",Hong S; Jo HC; Kim HL; Kim H; Lee J; Jeon J; Rhim J; Rhee S; Park J; Chung YH; Jung KO,,BMB reports,2025-08-04,,6.5,"visualization(title,abstract); visual(title,abstract)",
40776650,Bioinformatics And Experimental Insights Into Sotorasib Resistance Mechanisms in Non-small-cell Lung Cancer.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>This study aims to identify the key genes and pathways associated with sotorasib resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) using bioinformatics analyses and experimental validation, with a focus on uncovering the potential mechanisms underlying resistance.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared gene expression profiles between sotorasib-resistant (SR) and non-resistant NSCLC cell lines using the GSE229070 dataset and between NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues using the GSE18842 dataset. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and intersected across datasets using the Venn diagram package. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). The transcriptional activity and prognostic impact of key genes were evaluated using the UALCAN portal and Kaplan-Meier Plotter, respectively. The correlation between gene expression and immune cell infiltration was analyzed using the TIMER database, and co-expressed genes were explored using LinkedOmics. qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to validate the expression of AREG in parental and SR cell lines.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 33 overlapping DEGs, including TENM2, COL12A1, COL5A2, and LRRC15 (upregulated) and AREG (downregulated). AREG expression was significantly lower in NSCLC patients and associated with worse survival outcomes. AREG expression was also correlated with the levels of immune cell infiltration. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that AREG was associated with pathways including the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, focal adhesion, DNA replication, and homologous recombination. Experimental validation confirmed that AREG mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in HCC78-SR cells compared to parental HCC78 cells.<h4>Discussion</h4>The downregulation of AREG is closely associated with sotorasib resistance in NSCLC, potentially contributing to resistance through alterations in signaling pathways and the tumor immune microenvironment. This finding aligns with previous studies on AREG's role in drug resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. However, limitations include reliance on publicly available datasets and the need for further validation in clinical cohorts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study identifies AREG as a key gene associated with sotorasib resistance in NSCLC, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying AREG's role in resistance and to explore its clinical significance.",Li D; Lyu G,"Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Advanced Molecular Pathology Institute of Soochow University and SANO, Suzhou, 215128, China.",Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,2025-08-06,10.2174/0118715206386488250728113358,5.6,"visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract); informatics(title,abstract)",Resistance; NSCLC; GEO; Areg; Sotorasib; Focal Adhesion.

40764684,User-centered design approach to visualize PROMs for molecular tumor boards.,"Integrating Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) into Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) remains challenging due to the complexity of data visualization and integration into clinical workflows. This work, as part of the German PM4Onco project, aims to identify visualization requirements for PROMs and develop a prototype for PROMs integration in cBioPortal, facilitating broader application within oncology care. We employed a qualitative research approach, including developing personas for MTB stakeholders, conducting a literature-based requirements analysis, organizing a co-design workshop to create low-fidelity prototypes, and evaluating the highest-rated prototype variant through an online survey distributed to MTB physicians across Germany. Seven specialist groups were identified, with key needs including intuitive visualization, clear axis labeling, and longitudinal symptom tracking. The resulting mid-fidelity mockup incorporated PROMs data within cBioPortal's timeline view and a detailed PROMs tab, featuring trend indicators, line graphs, and customizable health displays. Usability evaluation by MTB members yielded a SUS score of 67, indicating an initial indicator of acceptable usability, with suggestions for improvements like threshold scores and deeper clinical data integration.

40779763,Optimizing Cardiovascular Risk Management in Primary Care Using a Personalized eCoach Solution Enhanced by an Artificial Intelligence-Driven Clinical Prediction Model: Protocol from the Coronary Artery Disease Risk Estimation and Early Detection Consortium. ,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease poses a heavy burden on the population's health and health care costs. Identifying apparently healthy individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases using clinical prediction models raises awareness, facilitates shared decision-making, and supports tailored management of disease prevention. In the CARRIER project, a personalized cardiovascular risk management (CVRM) eCoach approach is cocreated, in which identified individuals receive education, guidance, and monitoring to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease through existing interventions. In this approach, an artificial intelligence-driven clinical prediction model calculates the 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which supports informed decision-making. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of our CVRM eCoach approach through a 10-year risk calculation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including risk factors contributing to this risk. This pretest-posttest interventional study provides the CVRM eCoach approach for 6 months to 100 apparently healthy individuals eligible for CVRM. The CVRM eCoach approach is a multicomponent eHealth solution, including a clinical prediction under intervention model that not only calculates the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease through conventional risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, and lipid profile) and individual characteristics (age, gender, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and diet) but also calculates how the risk changes after hypothetical lifestyle or medical interventions. The CVRM eCoach approach includes features that encourage behavior change. Most of these features include goal setting, decision cards to help decide on an intervention, intervention monitoring, remote communication, and education, all accessible from one dashboard. A practice nurse or physician consults the individuals after risk calculation with the clinical prediction model and uses behavior change features, such as the decision cards, to support shared decision-making. Data are primarily collected via the eCoach, after which the 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its components are analyzed using paired-sample analyses. Recruitment began in March 2024 and will continue until 100 participants have been recruited, which is expected in 2025. We anticipate that our CVRM eCoach approach will be valuable in the primary prevention setting. During the crucial initial first months of habit formation, factors such as education, regular check-ups via the eCoach, and clear risk communication could support individuals in sustaining their medical or lifestyle interventions. We hypothesize that there will be a slight to moderate reduction in the 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which over time will lead to significant health improvements on a larger scale.

40773491,StatModPredict: A user-friendly R-Shiny interface for fitting and forecasting with statistical models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Many disciplines, such as public health, rely on statistical time series models for real-time and retrospective forecasting efforts; however, effectively implementing related methods often requires extensive programming knowledge. Therefore, such tools remain largely inaccessible to those with limited programming experience, including students training in modeling, as well as professionals and policymakers seeking to forecast an epidemic's trajectory. To address the need for accessible and intuitive forecasting applications, we present StatModPredict, an R-Shiny dashboard for conducting robust forecasting analysis utilizing auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), and Meta's Prophet model.<h4>Methods</h4>StatModPredict supports robust real-time forecasting and retrospective model analysis, including fitting, forecasting, evaluation, visualization, and comparison of results from four popular models. After loading an incident time series data set into the interface, users can easily customize model parameters and forecasting options to obtain the desired output. Additionally, StatModPredict offers multiple editable figures for, but not limited to, the time series data, the forecasts, and model fit and forecast metrics. Users can also upload external forecasts produced elsewhere and evaluate their performance alongside the dashboard's built-in models, thereby enabling direct comparisons. We provide a detailed demonstration of the dashboard's features using publicly available annual HIV case data in the US. A video tutorial is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZOvqhvqw8.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By eliminating programming barriers, StatModPredict facilitates exploration and use by students training in forecasting, as well as professionals and policymakers aiming to forecast epidemic trajectories. Additionally, the flexibility in the required input data structure and parameter specification process extends the application of StatModPredict to any discipline that employs time series data. By offering this open-source interface, we aim to broaden access to forecasting tools, promote hands-on learning, and foster contributions from users across disciplines.",Bleichrodt A; Phan A; Luo R; Kirpich A; Chowell G,"Department of Population Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.",PloS one,2025-08-07,10.1371/journal.pone.0329791,4.5,visualization(abstract); dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

This study aims to externally validate the population pharmacokinetic (PK) models implemented in TDMx, an online MIPD dashboard system, for adult and pediatric Korean IBD patients before clinical use. This retrospective study included 199 IBD patients (142 adults, 57 children) treated with intravenous infliximab at Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea) from 2019 to 2023. Three adult and seven pediatric models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, goodness of fit plots, prediction-corrected visual predictive checks, and normalized prediction distribution errors. For adults, the Passot model showed the best fit (mean percentage error (MPE) 26.4%, mean absolute error (MAE) 1.1 mg/L, relative root-mean square error (rRMSE) 159.0%), whereas all pediatric models were unsuitable for clinical use (MPE 30.4%-143.4%, MAE 1.4-2.6 mg/L, rRMSE 96.3%-564.0%). Predictive performance was compared between datasets with or without accurate information on antibodies-toward-infliximab (ATI), as well as with and without previous concentrations. Assuming all patients were ATI positive improved predictive performance, likely due to the inherent positive bias of the population PK models. Incorporating previous concentrations improved predictions for adult models, achieving acceptable accuracy and precision (Passot model: MPE 17.5%, MAE 1.8 mg/L, rRMSE 80.3% with one concentration). However, pediatric models remained clinically unacceptable, highlighting the need to develop models specifically tailored for this population.",Kim Y; Baek SH; Jang IJ; Chung JY,"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Hospital, Seoul, Korea.",CPT: pharmacometrics & systems pharmacology,2025-08-04,10.1002/psp4.70089,3.0,dashboard(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Model evaluation; therapeutic drug monitoring; Population Pharmacokinetics; Individualization
40779024,MRI-based 3D models of cranial nerves in clinical care: a systematic review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Technical advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition and reconstruction have improved the visualization of anatomical structures such as cranial nerves (CNs) and enabled subsequent three-dimensional (3D) models for use in clinical care. However, a comprehensive overview of indications and techniques is lacking. The current study aimed to comprehensively describe and assess the techniques and applications used in MRI-based 3D modeling of CNs.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic review of articles published in Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases on clinically applied MRI-based 3D models of CNs up to December 2023. We modified the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies to assess the risk of bias.<h4>Results</h4>We analyzed 37 studies presenting virtual 3D models of CNs II, III, and V-X in proximity to pathologies in the head and neck area and intracranial, including vestibular schwannoma, skull base tumors, cerebellopontine angle tumors, and neurovascular compression syndrome. Certain studies explored alternative visualization modalities, including printed and augmented reality models. The creation of these 3D models involved the utilization of several MRI sequences and segmentation tools. The models demonstrate potential benefits for preoperative planning, intraoperative decision-making, and patient counseling.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MRI-specific sequences and segmentation techniques render CNs in 3D models, helping before and during surgery.<h4>Relevance statement</h4>MRI-based 3D models of cranial nerves help surgeons before and during surgery and enhance patient understanding of the procedure and its risks. Wider clinical adoption requires an established workflow, technical expertise, and collaboration to ensure accessibility and knowledge sharing.<h4>Key points</h4>3D modeling of cranial nerves is a promising tool for preoperative planning, surgery, and patient-doctor communication. Data heterogeneity and small sample sizes hinder definitive conclusions about the best MRI techniques and segmentation protocols for 3D visualization of cranial nerves. Adopting MRI-based 3D models widely needs a set workflow, technical skills, and team collaboration.",Moll MCM; Karssemakers LHE; Baarsma M; Braun LMM; Ter Beek LC; van der Mierden S; Karakullukcu B; Smeele LE; van Alphen MJA; Valstar MH,"Department of Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Plesmanlaan 121 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. man.moll@nki.nl.",European radiology experimental,2025-08-08,10.1186/s41747-025-00608-8,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Surgical procedures; Cranial nerves; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Augmented Reality; Imaging (Three-dimensional)
40770361,Clinical information prompt-driven retinal fundus image for brain health evaluation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Brain volume measurement serves as a critical approach for assessing brain health status. Considering the close biological connection between the eyes and brain, this study aims to investigate the feasibility of estimating brain volume through retinal fundus imaging integrated with clinical metadata, and to offer a cost-effective approach for assessing brain health.<h4>Methods</h4>Based on clinical information, retinal fundus images, and neuroimaging data derived from a multicenter, population-based cohort study, the KaiLuan Study, we proposed a cross-modal correlation representation (CMCR) network to elucidate the intricate co-degenerative relationships between the eyes and brain for 755 subjects. Specifically, individual clinical information, which has been followed up for as long as 12 years, was encoded as a prompt to enhance the accuracy of brain volume estimation. Independent internal validation and external validation were performed to assess the robustness of the proposed model. Root mean square error (RMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) metrics were employed to quantitatively evaluate the quality of synthetic brain images derived from retinal imaging data.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed framework yielded average RMSE, PSNR, and SSIM values of 98.23, 35.78 dB, and 0.64, respectively, which significantly outperformed 5 other methods: multi-channel Variational Autoencoder (mcVAE), Pixel-to-Pixel (Pixel2pixel), transformer-based U-Net (TransUNet), multi-scale transformer network (MT-Net), and residual vision transformer (ResViT). The two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) visualization results showed that the shape and texture of the synthetic brain images generated by the proposed method most closely resembled those of actual brain images. Thus, the CMCR framework accurately captured the latent structural correlations between the fundus and the brain. The average difference between predicted and actual brain volumes was 61.36 cm<sup>3</sup>, with a relative error of 4.54%. When all of the clinical information (including age and sex, daily habits, cardiovascular factors, metabolic factors, and inflammatory factors) was encoded, the difference was decreased to 53.89 cm<sup>3</sup>, with a relative error of 3.98%. Based on the synthesized brain MR images from retinal fundus images, the volumes of brain tissues could be estimated with high accuracy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides an innovative, accurate, and cost-effective approach to characterize brain health status through readily accessible retinal fundus images.<h4>Trial registration no</h4>NCT05453877 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ).",Tong N; Hui Y; Gou SP; Chen LX; Wang XH; Chen SH; Li J; Li XS; Wu YT; Wu SL; Wang ZC; Sun J; Lv H,"Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of the Ministry of Education, School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi'an, 710071, China.",Military Medical Research,2025-08-06,10.1186/s40779-025-00630-2,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain Volume; Brain Health; Deep Learning; Retinal Fundus Image; Eye And Brain Connection
40763084,Augmented Reality in Airway Management: A Scoping Review.,"Augmented reality, which overlays virtual information onto the physical environment, is an emerging technology in health care with promising applications in education, diagnostics, and procedural support. Its use in airway management-an essential aspect of anesthesiology and critical care-remains underexplored. This scoping review evaluates the current literature on augmented reality in airway management, with the aim of identifying its benefits, limitations, and future potential. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and IEEE databases, after PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Studies were included if they focused on augmented reality-assisted airway training or procedures and excluded if they centered on virtual reality or lacked procedural relevance. Ten studies met inclusion criteria, including 8 observational studies and 2 randomized controlled trials. Most utilized head-mounted displays to support simulation-based training or procedural guidance across pediatric and adult populations. Outcomes assessed included objective measures-such as intubation success, timing, and procedural accuracy-and subjective metrics like user confidence, perceived usability, and educational value. Results varied across studies. Several reported enhanced anatomical visualization, improved procedural success, and increased realism in training. One randomized controlled trial demonstrated higher intubation success rates and reduced procedure times when augmented reality-assisted video laryngoscopy was compared to standard methods. Another randomized controlled trial using a head-mounted display to deliver a procedural checklist found greater checklist adherence but also longer intubation times. Subjective feedback from participants noted challenges including device complexity, learning curve, and equipment limitations. Despite these encouraging findings, the current evidence base is limited by small sample sizes, variability in study design, and a lack of standardized evaluation protocols. Importantly, no study directly assessed the safety profile of augmented reality in airway management or its impact on patient-centered outcomes. In conclusion, augmented reality has the potential to improve anatomical understanding, procedural accuracy, and educational engagement in airway management. However, its integration into clinical practice is still in early stages. More rigorous, large-scale clinical trials are needed to determine its efficacy, optimize usability, and clarify its role in enhancing patient safety and provider training in anesthesiology and critical care.",Hart A; Zemel M; Henson L; Beard L; Arora V,"From the University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.",Anesthesia and analgesia,2025-08-05,10.1213/ane.0000000000007633,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),
40770453,"MoB QDs/N, F-CDs for ratiometric fluorescence sensing of perfluorooctanoic acid based on fluorine‑fluorine interaction.","A dual-emission ratiometric fluorescence probe was constructed for detection of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) by hybridizing MoB quantum dots (MoB QDs) and nitrogen, fluorine co-doped carbon dots (N, F-CDs). As the concentration of PFOA increased, the fluorescence emission of MoB QDs/N, F-CDs at 560 nm was quenched due to fluorine-fluorine interaction, while the fluorescence emission at 440 nm kept unchanged, resulting in the fluorescence color changing from yellow to green. A good linear relationship was observed between I<sub>440</sub>/I<sub>560</sub> and the concentration of PFOA in the range 0.01-90 μM and 90-450 μM, with a detection limit as low as 0.01 μM. The test strips for PFOA were prepared for on-site visualization and quantitative determination. The fluorescence images of the test strips were acquired using the camera in the smartphone, and the signals were converted into RGB values by color recognition software. The obtained G/R value had a good linear relationship with the concentration of PFOA ranging from 0.5 to 200 μM. The deep learning model of YOLOv5 algorithm was utilized for data analysis to make the fluorescence detection more accurate. Therefore, the ratiometric fluorescence sensing system is established with easy operation, short response time, and low cost for on-site detection of PFOA in real water samples and textiles, which is of practical significance for environmental water monitoring and human health.",Wang J; Wan X; Li W; Song C; Gao Q; Pan Q; He Y,"Ministry-of-Education Key Laboratory for the Synthesis and Application of Organic Functional Molecules, Hubei Province Key Laboratory for Precision Manufacturing of Small Molecular Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hubei University, Wuhan, 430062, China.",Mikrochimica acta,2025-08-06,10.1007/s00604-025-07431-3,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Perfluorooctanoic Acid; Deep Learning; Ratiometric Fluorescence; Nitrogen And Fluorine Co-doped Carbon Dots; Mob Quantum Dots
40775758,Longitudinal graphics of patient-reported physical function in patients treated for hematologic malignancies.,"<h4>Background</h4>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a draft guidance document detailing core patient-reported outcomes in cancer clinical trials, including physical function (PF). The objectives of this study were to develop analytic methods and visualizations of patient-reported PF in patients with cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied an estimand framework to a patient-reported tolerability endpoint to develop data summaries cross-sectionally and over time, along with visualizations. We accomplished this through iterative feedback with clinicians, statisticians, and FDA stakeholders using three clinical trial datasets in hematologic malignancies. Graphical approaches were applied to three datasets in hematologic malignancies: (1) patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms enrolled in MPN-RC 111/112 trials completed EORTC QLQ-C30 over 12 months; (2) patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing CAR-T cell therapy or autologous transplant who completed FACT questionnaires over 6 months; and (3) patients with multiple myeloma or amyloidosis who completed the PROMIS-29 questionnaire over 6 months. Zoom polls were administered to two stakeholder groups (clinicians/clinical investigators and patient advocates) to elicit feedback.<h4>Results</h4>Visualizations included stacked bar charts, line plots of arithmetic mean changes from baseline, pie charts, waffle plots, and waterfall plots of PF data. Graphics considered scaled scores and individual items and included delineation of PRO completion rate at each time point. Confidence intervals and reference lines were included as applicable, and colorblind accessible colors were implemented to ensure inclusivity of all visualizations. Data summaries over time reporting ""worst"" change were difficult to interpret. In terms of stakeholders' preference, patients preferred stacked bar charts while clinicians equally favored stacked bar charts and line plots; both patients and clinicians preferred waterfall plots to pie charts. Patient feedback highlighted the need for various graphics to convey group level trends and granular individual-patient level information.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Patient-reported PF informs the evaluation of treatment tolerability in cancer trials. Data summaries and visualizations of physical function developed through an iterative process were reviewed favorably by patients, clinicians and FDA stakeholders in this study. Future work to systematically assess accuracy of interpretation of the various analytic and visualization methods is a necessary next step across clinical, regulatory, payer and patient stakeholders.<h4>Trial registration</h4>NCT01259817, NCT01259856.",Thanarajasingam G; Bhatnagar V; Noble BN; Chen TY; Fiero MH; Hoffman R; Jeffery M; Mazza GL; Mascarenhas J; Mesa R; Murugappan M; Ross J; Sidana S; Warsame R; Kluetz PG; Dueck AC,"Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, USA. thanarajasingam.gita@mayo.edu.",BMC medical research methodology,2025-08-07,10.1186/s12874-025-02617-y,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Cancer; Graphics; Physical Function; Longitudinal Analysis; Treatment Tolerability
40768467,Improving 3D Thin Vessel Segmentation in Brain TOF-MRA via a Dual-space Context-Aware Network.,"3D cerebrovascular segmentation poses a significant challenge, akin to locating a line within a vast 3D environment. This complexity can be substantially reduced by projecting the vessels onto a 2D plane, enabling easier segmentation. In this paper, we create a vessel-segmentation-friendly space using a clinical visualization technique called maximum intensity projection (MIP). Leveraging this, we propose a Dual-space Context-Aware Network (DCANet) for 3D vessel segmentation, designed to capture even the finest vessel structures accurately. DCANet begins by transforming a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) volume into a 3D Regional-MIP volume, where each Regional-MIP slice is constructed by projecting adjacent MRA slices. This transformation highlights vessels as prominent continuous curves rather than the small circular or ellipsoidal cross-sections seen in MRA slices. DCANet encodes vessels separately in the MRA and the projected Regional-MIP spaces and introduces the Regional-MIP Image Fusion Block (MIFB) between these dual spaces to selectively integrate contextual features from Regional-MIP into MRA. Following dual-space encoding, DCANet employs a Dual-mask Spatial Guidance TransFormer (DSGFormer) decoder to focus on vessel regions while effectively excluding background areas, which reduces the learning burden and improves segmentation accuracy. We benchmark DCANet on four datasets: two public datasets, TubeTK and IXI-IOP, and two in-house datasets, Xiehe and IXI-HH. The results demonstrate that DCANet achieves superior performance, with improvements in average DSC values of at least 2.26%, 2.17%, 2.62%, and 2.58% for thin vessels, respectively.

40769376,Intelligent microfluidic device for multiplex detection and prompt warning of upper and lower respiratory tract infections.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>The increasing incidence and co-infection rates of multiple respiratory diseases have emphasized the necessity for efficient and reliable multiplex diagnostic methods for respiratory pathogens.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to develop a multiplex diagnostic tool for monitoring and early warning of respiratory infections.<h4>Methods</h4>A portable, centrifugal and highly integrated microfluidic device based on real-time recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assays capable of specifically identifying 15 common respiratory pathogens was developed. Its point-of-care application was validated using simulated swabs and sputum spiked with 15 pathogens. A total of 427 collected samples were employed to assess its clinical performance, in parallel with traditional extraction kits and RT-qPCR/qPCR assays. Additionally, the feasibility of its connected monitoring and early warning platform was validated across 22 scenarios in 8 cities of mainland China.<h4>Results</h4>This device successfully facilitated sample-to-answer diagnostics by automating nucleic acid extraction, real-time RAA, fluorescence detection and wireless data transmission. Compared with conventional methods, this device has obvious advantages in the turnaround time (30 min for swabs and 60 min for sputum) and the detectable targets/types in a single test. The lowest detection limits of this device were 0.1 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL for viral targets and 10 CFU/mL for bacterial or fungal targets. This newly developed device has good versatility in detecting various types of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) in clinical samples, achieving an AUC above 0.99 for all targets and an accuracy of 99.30 % in the analysis of 345 swab and 82 sputum samples. Moreover, this device achieved seamless data interaction with the intelligent monitoring and early warning system across 22 scenarios, enabling the successful visualization of data statistics and early warning analyses for uploaded information.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This device provides an intelligent, portable, rapid, and sensitive platform for early diagnosis of multiple pathogens, particularly in resource-limited settings.",Gao S; Wang L; Zhao M; Xiang Y; Yang X; Xiong Y; Bai J; Han T; Yang Z; Li H; Lyu X; Zhao L; Sun Y; Wu X; Shen X; Ma X,"National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases, NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 102206, China.",Journal of advanced research,2025-08-04,10.1016/j.jare.2025.08.005,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),microfluidic chip; Respiratory Pathogens; Nucleic Acid Extraction; Multiplexed Detection; Recombinase-aided Amplification
40762971,Exploring the Time to Onset and Early Predictors of Poststroke Spasticity Combined With Surface Electromyography: Protocol for a Nested Case-Control Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Poststroke spasticity (PSS) is a frequent sequela in patients who have experienced stroke. This form of paralysis is more prevalent compared to other poststroke sequelae and is among the most challenging and complex symptoms to manage. Surface electromyography (sEMG) can reflect the physiological information of muscles in real time and is highly beneficial in diagnosing neuromuscular diseases in clinical medicine.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to investigate the timing of poststroke limb spasms using a nested case-control study combined with sEMG and to identify and predict factors of PSS at an early stage.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a nested case-control study. Participants were assessed within 24 hours of the onset of hospitalization using a standardized case report form to evaluate general patient information and clinical data related to cerebral infarction and imaging. Upon inclusion, patients were assessed after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) for spasticity severity, root mean square values from sEMG for limb spasm severity, and the simplified Fugl-Meyer (S-FM) Assessment for limb motor function. Patients who experienced spasticity within 12 weeks were assigned to the spasticity group, whereas those who did not experience spasticity were assigned to the control group. Unmatched case grouping was implemented. Data with normal distribution were analyzed using the t test, while data with nonnormal distribution were analyzed using the rank-sum test; categorical data were analyzed using the chi-square test, rank-sum test, or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors affecting treatment outcomes. Data processing, analysis, and visualization were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (version 26.0; IBM Corp).<h4>Results</h4>This study is funded by the Chinese Association of Ethnic Medicine and began participant recruitment and registration in November 2023. The study is currently ongoing, with 66 participants enrolled as of March 2025.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study selected a diagnostic method combining sEMG and subjective scales to determine PSS, aiming to eliminate diagnostic errors caused by subjective assessments. This study adopted a nested case-control study method, which has minimal information bias, allowing for the inference of causal relationships between exposure and disease.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2300077121; https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=205037.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/65829.",Song S; Wang S; Zeng S; Wu W; Wu L; Tang X; Sun X; Wu D; Xie L,"Graduate School, Hunan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changsha, China.",JMIR research protocols,2025-08-05,10.2196/65829,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),Stroke; Surface electromyography; Nested Case-control Study; Early Predictor; Poststroke Spasticity
40758488,"Automated Mapping the Pathways of Cranial Nerve II, III, V, and VII/VIII: A Multi-Parametric Multi-Stage Diffusion Tractography Atlas.","<h4>Objective</h4>Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.<h4>Method</h4>In this work, we present what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).<h4>Results</h4>Quantitative and visual experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of pituitary adenoma patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8 fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II, oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally.<h4>Significance</h4>This work contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.",Xie L; Huang J; Zhang J; He J; Pan Y; Xie G; Li M; Zeng Q; Li M; Feng Y,,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2025-08-04,10.1109/tbme.2025.3595182,3.0,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract); data(abstract),

40767072,Seeing inside the Body Using Wearable Sensing and Imaging Technologies.,"The growing demand for personalized and real-time health assessment has driven rapid advancements in wearable health monitoring technologies. A critical shift is underway from reactive, treatment-centered care toward proactive, preventive healthcare models, motivating efforts to observe internal physiological states more accurately from outside the body. This review presents wearable monitoring technologies for evaluating internal organ function, focusing on two principal approaches: indirect sensing-based methods and direct imaging-based methods. Indirect methods utilize surrogate signals-including electrophysiological activity, physical responses, and biochemical markers-to infer physiological states. To address the limitations of single-modality sensing, recent developments in multimodal systems that integrate electrical, chemical, and physical signals are also highlighted. However, indirect approaches based on biomarkers are often insufficient for diagnostic applications that require direct visualization of organ structure and function. Therefore, this review further explores direct imaging technologies, such as wearable ultrasound and electrical impedance tomography (EIT), which offer more immediate insights into internal biological conditions. By combining indirect and direct strategies, wearable systems are evolving beyond surface-level monitoring to enable internal visualization and functional assessment of organs. This review outlines the key enabling technologies and discusses their potential to advance participatory, personalized, and precision healthcare through continuous and context-aware monitoring platforms.",Kim S; Han S; Park S; Koo J,"School of Biomedical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025-08-06,10.1002/adhm.202502480,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Multimodal Sensing; Direct Imaging; Wearable Health Monitoring; Indirect Sensing; Real‐time Continuous Monitoring

The kitten underwent thoracoscopic guided surgical correction of PE using a small gauge needle-scope to aid in visualization. Surgical treatment of this kitten included the use of a small gauge needle-scope for video-assisted thoracoscopy which provided direct visualization for passage of sutures into the thoracic cavity and around sternebrae which were then secured to an external splinting device.<h4>Results</h4>The patient recovered uneventfully with clinical improvements at both 2- and 6-weeks postoperatively. Five month postoperative follow-up with the owner revealed no evidence of respiratory signs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of a small gauge needle-scope provided excellent visualization for safe suture passage for external splinting in a pediatric feline patient with severe PE.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>For small pediatric felines, a small gauge needle-scope can be used for thoracoscopic visualization of suture passage for external splinting for PE.

40767363,Three-dimensional versus two-dimensional laparoscopy: What is the evidence?,"<h4>Background</h4>Minimally invasive surgery has made tremendous progress in the last two decades thanks to the more sophisticated instrumentation, new entry ports, vessel sealant devices, and ultrasound dissectors. Cameras and monitors are now high-definition or 4 K, increasing the clarity of the image available to the surgeon. Those progresses have made minimally invasive surgery safer. However, the biggest challenge of minimally invasive surgery is the lack of depth perception, which requires the surgeon's brain to recreate a three-dimensional (3D) image using cues in the field. The development of 3D cameras enable surgeons to have a more realistic depth perception. The development of the third generation of 3D cameras, combined with light-polarizing glasses, resolved the problem of dizziness experienced by surgeons during long and complicated procedures.<h4>Aims</h4>To review the evidence from human and veterinary surgery regarding the benefits of 3D visualization during laparoscopy.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>The evidence suggests that 3D visualization enhances depth perception, safety, a smoother learning curve, and overall wellness for surgeons. Some controversies persist on the clinical benefit of 3D visualization, even if most of the studies showed statistically significant reduction of operating time, estimated blood loss, operating errors, and shorten hospital stay in human patients.",Monnet E,"Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.",Veterinary surgery : VS,2025-08-06,10.1111/vsu.14329,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),

The distance (X) from the spinous process to the mammillary process was measured fluoroscopically. Group A portals were placed from X to 2X; Group B portals from 2X to 3X. Visualization and instrument accessibility were compared. Based on cadaveric results, mini-hemilaminectomy was performed in three live dogs using the superior (Group B) portal position. Intraoperative epidural pressure was measured. Postoperative magnetic resonance image (MRI) on day 0, 14, and 28 evaluated muscle recovery, fluid extravasation, and spinal/dural compression.<h4>Results</h4>Mini-hemilaminectomy was successfully performed with both portal positions. Surgical time and number of fluoroscopic scans did not differ between groups. Scope insertion angles were steeper in Group B (p < .001), which also showed higher visualization and accessibility scores (p < .001). Group B portals were used in the in vivo study. Epidural pressure remained stable, and MRI revealed transient postoperative muscle edema that resolved by day 28.<h4>Conclusion</h4>UBE was feasible in cadavers and safe in live dog models. Group B portal positioning provided better visualization and accessibility.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>UBE presents a potential minimally invasive approach for thoracolumbar spinal surgery in dogs.",Nam S; Jeon Y; Kim J; Jeong J; Jeong S; Lee Y; Lee H,"College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.",Veterinary surgery : VS,2025-08-04,10.1111/vsu.14324,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),
40773101,White matter microdissection of the lateral aspect of the brain: 2-dimensional video demonstration.,"<h4>Background</h4>The white matter dissection technique owes its modern recognition to Josef Klingler, whose fixation protocol enabled detailed fiber bundle visualization and led to an outstanding and still relevant atlas of white matter anatomy. After a period of decline in the late twentieth century, the technique was reintroduced into neurosurgical training with the aid of the surgical microscope, emphasizing the importance of fiber dissection and its practical applications in clinical neuroanatomy. This article provides a structured, step-by-step demonstration of white matter microdissection, progressing from superficial anatomy to deeper fiber layers. Its main contribution is the supplementary video, which offers a detailed, structured demonstration of the dissection steps and white matter layers, replicating the format and clarity of hands-on dissection courses. Careful editing and post-processing were applied to optimize educational impact.<h4>Methods</h4>The dissection was recorded during the 7th Sulci, Gyri, Ventricles and Fiber Dissection Hands-on Course (Taipei, November 2024). Identifiable participants gave informed consent for publication.<h4>Results</h4>The video illustrates a systematic lateral-to-medial dissection, beginning with sulcal and gyral identification. Grey matter is removed to expose U-fibers, followed by progressive visualization of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, insular cortex, extreme and external capsules, claustrum, basal ganglia, and anterior commissure. Each step is accompanied by commentary and technical tips to guide the dissection and preserve anatomical integrity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>By mastering the topography of white matter, neurosurgeons can enhance their understanding of pathological anatomy, allowing for precise mental rehearsal and strategic planning before surgery. This approach underscores the enduring importance of anatomical studies in improving surgical outcomes and advancing neurosurgical practice.",Zanuttini L; Staartjes VE; Chen SC; Lin CF; Hsu SPC; Martins C; Wen HT; Serra C; Türe U,"Machine Intelligence in Clinical Neuroscience & Microsurgical Neuroanatomy (MICN) Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Neuroscience Center, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Frauenklinikstrasse 10, 8091, Zurich, Switzerland.",Acta neurochirurgica,2025-08-07,10.1007/s00701-025-06635-z,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Fiber Dissection; White Matter; Microneurosurgery; Klingler
40754635,CXCR4-targeted theranostics in acute leukemia: disrupting leukemic cell-microenvironment interactions with pentixafor and pentixather.,"The CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling axis governs leukemic stem cell dynamics within the bone marrow niche, driving migration, survival, and therapy resistance. This review examines a CXCR4-directed theranostic strategy for acute leukemia using Pentixafor and Pentixather. Pentixafor enables non-invasive visualization of CXCR4 expression, while Pentixather delivers targeted radiotherapy to CXCR4-expressing leukemic cells. We analyze how disrupting CXCR4-mediated leukemic cell-niche interactions enhances treatment efficacy and improves clinical outcomes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). By integrating imaging and therapy, this approach offers a novel strategy to overcome microenvironment-mediated chemoresistance in hematologic malignancies. It advances personalized medicine by stratifying patients for CXCR4-targeted therapy and preserves functional hematopoietic niches, ultimately improving patient care.",Rahimian S; Najafi H; Doroudian M,"Department of Cell and Molecular Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Kharazmi University, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran.","Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",2025-08-04,10.1007/s12032-025-02924-w,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),CXCR4; Acute leukemia; Theranostics; Bone Marrow Niche; Pentixather; Pentixafor
40773024,Left pulmonary artery atresia and MAPCA aneurysm.,"Unilateral atresia of the pulmonary artery (UAPA) is a rare condition often associated with congenital cardiac anomalies, such as tetralogy of Fallot or septal defects. UAPA is linked to an altered development of the sixth aortic arch segment, resulting in the proximal interruption of the pulmonary artery and it often occurs on the side of the chest opposite the aortic arch [1]. As a compensatory mechanism, major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) arise from systemic arteries to supply distal intrapulmonary branches of the atretic pulmonary artery. MAPCAs can originate from various vessels, including the descending aorta, bronchial, intercostal, internal mammary, subclavian, or even coronary arteries. Patients with UAPA may present with diverse clinical symptoms, including chest pain, pleural effusion, recurrent infections, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and hemoptysis [1, 2]. Chest radiographs reveal characteristic features: asymmetric lung fields with a small, hyperlucent lung with a raised diaphragm on the affected side, and an ipsilateral shift of the mediastinum. Extensive transpleural collateral circulation may mimic tuberculosis on plain films. CT and MRI allow direct visualization of the absent pulmonary artery and associated cardiac anomalies. A CT scans often show collateral vessels, mosaic parenchymal changes, and bronchiectasis due to recurrent infections in the affected lung [2].",Niemierko J; Tweed K; D'Errico L,"Department of Radiology, Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK. julia.niemierko@nhs.net.",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2025-08-07,10.1007/s10554-025-03466-y,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Collateral circulation; congenital; Mapca; Uapa; Pulmonary Artery Atresia
40767571,Bringing to Light the Invisible Lymphatic Anatomy of the Upper Extremity: Report From the 2024 Harvard Radcliffe Institute Accelerator Workshop.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To identify vulnerable upper extremity regions in native lymphatic anatomy that predispose women to the development of breast cancer-related lymphedema. Additionally, to identify currently available imaging technologies that could be repurposed for in-vivo lymphatic imaging of these anatomic regions and pathways.<h4>Background</h4>Breast cancer-related lymphedema remains an incurable complication of breast cancer treatment, but improvements to knowledge of upper extremity lymphatic anatomy and imaging can unlock new techniques for prevention and treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>""Bringing to Light the Invisible Lymphatic Anatomy of the Human Body"" was a two day accelerator workshop held in May 2024 at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute attended by sixteen experts in lymphatic anatomy and imaging including four lymphatic anatomists, five imaging clinicians, three lymphatic scientists, and three program officers from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).<h4>Results</h4>Collateral pathways of the superficial lymphatic system, perforating lymphatic vessels, and the deep lymphatic system were implicated in preventing or reducing the severity of BCRL. Several strategies were proposed for repurposing existing imaging technology and developing new imaging technology that can improve understanding of the anatomy, function, and connectivity of lymphatic vessels in these three regions of the arm.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Advancements in lymphatic imaging are central to refining our knowledge of lymphatic anatomy. Key challenges to lymphatic imaging are visualization of the deep lymphatic system and perforating lymphatic vessels.",Fanning JE; Tsai LL; Amore MA; Crescenzi R; De Paepe KN; Donohoe KJ; Maki JH; Padera TP; Pieper CC; Reynolds HM; Suami H; Singhal D,"Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.",Annals of surgery,2025-08-06,10.1097/sla.0000000000006893,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Lymphatic; Upper extremity; Lymph Node; Lymphedema; Lymphatic Imaging
40775508,Neuronavigation accuracy of the VOSTARS wearable AR platform vs traditional infrared navigation in a comparative study.,"Neuronavigation is integral to modern neurosurgery. Clinical studies demonstrate its effectiveness. The primary tracking modalities in neurosurgical navigation are optical tracking systems (OTS) and electromagnetic tracking systems (EMTS). OTS remains the gold standard due to its accuracy and reliability. However, inherent inaccuracies due to brain deformation, image resolution, tool calibration, and registration errors can impact overall accuracy significantly, which differs from the system-declared accuracy. Augmented reality (AR) technologies solve traditional navigation challenges by integrating virtual information with the patient's anatomy, enhancing the surgeon's focus and cognitive load management. Head-mounted displays (HMDs) offer ergonomic benefits, although most AR-based neuronavigation studies have been limited to proof-of-concept trials. This study aims to evaluate VOSTARS, a novel hybrid video and optical see-through HMD designed for precision surgery, specifically in neurosurgical oncology for targeting supratentorial tumors. Previous in-vitro studies using patient-specific phantoms have shown promising results, with high accuracy in real-to-virtual target visualization and craniotomy trajectory tracing. With this work, we further assessed VOSTARS' targeting accuracy within a realistic neurosurgery clinical workflow and compared its performance to the commercial StealthStation system on a patient-specific phantom. Our results demonstrate that users achieved the same median accuracy, 2 mm (IQR: 1 mm), over 60 measurements with both VOSTARS and the StealthStation with no statistically significant difference between the systems, confirming the non-inferiority of the VOSTARS platform compared to a commercial optical tracking-based surgical navigator.",Carbone M; Cattari N; Cutolo F; Autelitano M; Cigna E; Ferrari V; Montemurro N; Condino S,"Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, 56122, Pisa, Italy.",Scientific reports,2025-08-07,10.1038/s41598-025-14555-2,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Neurosurgery; Augmented Reality; Surgical Navigation; Targeting Accuracy; Phantom Trials
40779192,Three-Dimensional Virtual Models in Robot Assisted Partial Nephrectomy: A Needed Tool in the Era of Precision Surgery.,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) has become the gold standard for treating localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in high-volume centres. However, increasing tumor complexity demands refined preoperative planning tools. This review summarizes current evidence regarding the use of three-dimensional virtual models (3DVM) in RAPN, focusing on their clinical applications, outcomes and future perspectives.<h4>Recent findings</h4>3DVMs are generated from contrast-enhanced CT scans through segmentation and reconstruction, enabling interactive anatomical visualization. These models provide functional tools such as perfusion territory mapping, volumetric renal function prediction and nephrometry-based complexity stratification. Integration with augmented reality (AR) platforms allows real-time intraoperative navigation. Comparative studies and meta-analyses demonstrate that 3DVM-guided RAPN is associated with reduced warm ischemia time (WIT), lower estimated blood loss (EBL), higher trifecta/pentafecta achievement and improved postoperative renal function, particularly in complex tumors. Additionally, 3DVM enhance surgical education and patient counselling. 3DVM represent a pivotal advancement in personalized urologic surgery. By improving anatomical comprehension, surgical precision, and planning of selective ischemia strategies, they contribute to superior intraoperative and functional outcomes in RAPN. Although promising, broader implementation requires standardization, cost-effectiveness validation and further multicentre prospective studies.",Hevia V; García-Rojo E; Brime-Menéndez R; Pérez-Ruiz JM; Belkahia G; Paesano N; Barrientos F; Duque-Ruiz G; Lista-Mateos F; Justo-Quintas J; Romero-Otero J,"Department of Urology, ROC Clinic HM Hospitales, Madrid, Spain. vital.hevia@rocclinic.com.",Current urology reports,2025-08-08,10.1007/s11934-025-01288-y,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Renal cell carcinoma; Surgical Planning; Augmented Reality; Nephron-sparing Surgery; Robot-assisted Partial Nephrectomy; Intraoperative Navigation; Selective Arterial Clamping; Three-dimensional Virtual Models; Renal Volumetry; 3D Imaging In Urology
40768368,Ultrasound Detection of Pulseless Rhythm with Echocardiographic Motion (PREM) in Prehospital Cardiac Arrest: A Case-Series.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This case series highlights the utility of Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) during cardiac arrest pulse checks, and how this tool can be used to identify Pulseless Rhythm with Echocardiographic Motion (PREM), also known as pseudo-pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and the potential changes in prehospital resuscitation management based on that finding.<h4>Methods</h4>We've documented four cases of PREM identification in the prehospital field to draw attention to this phenomenon and ideally serve as a blueprint for other agencies to adopt PREM-specific protocols.<h4>Results</h4>This case series demonstrates how cardiac visualization alters patient management in the setting of cardiac arrest. Each of the cases presented is unique in presentation and treatment. The use of POCUS has opened a door to the possibility of adopting prehospital guidelines for the management of PREM in prehospital cardiac arrest and subsequently more tailored treatment of patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Use of portable ultrasound in prehospital cardiac arrest highlights a large gap in our understanding and treatment of PREM. While these patients all ultimately died, their cases highlight the opportunity for more appropriate care, both prehospital and in-hospital. Because literature has posited that PEA is a more complex cardiac rhythm than previously thought, we are suggesting that pre-hospital cardiac arrest care guidelines reflect our current body of understanding. These cases emphasize the importance of emergency medical service (EMS) POCUS use and supports a transition to hands-free, or ultrasound-guided, pulse checks during cardiac arrest. More research is needed regarding the etiology of Pulseless Rhythm with Echocardiographic Standstill (PRES) versus PREM, what treatment guidelines would be best in cases of PREM, and how we can implement PREM recognition to health care personnel of all levels on a national scale.",Watson M; Barbour J; Rayburn D,"Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA.",Prehospital emergency care,2025-08-06,10.1080/10903127.2025.2543444,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Cardiac arrest; Emergency Medical Services; Pulseless Electrical Activity; Point Of Care Ultrasound; Pseudo-pea; Pulseless Rhythm With Echocardiographic Motion
40776860,Redefining AT1 Receptor PET Imaging: Introducing the Radiotracer [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DR29.,"<h4>Background</h4>AT1R (angiotensin II type 1 receptors) are central to the renin-angiotensin system and are involved in regulating blood pressure and renal physiology. This study introduces [<sup>18</sup>F]DR29, a fluorine-18-labeled radiotracer for positron emission tomography imaging, to enable noninvasive visualization of AT1R expression. Its potential applications in understanding AT1R-associated renal processes are explored in healthy and hypertensive rat models.<h4>Methods</h4>Radiolabeling was established, and biodistribution studies were conducted on healthy Wistar rats with and without the AT1R antagonist candesartan and transporter inhibitors. Dynamic positron emission tomography imaging assessed tracer specificity, and feasibility for renal AT1R quantification was explored using a hypertensive rat model.<h4>Results</h4>[<sup>18</sup>F]DR29 was radiolabeled with a yield of 36±6%. High kidney uptake was observed, significantly reduced by candesartan (kidney-to-blood ratio, 0.43±0.01 versus 4.54±1.59 in vehicle, where vehicle refers to saline without any treatment). Transporter inhibition protocols targeting organic anion transporting polypeptides (liver) and organic anion transporters (kidneys) successfully reduced radiotracer clearance, increasing the specific accumulation of [<sup>18</sup>F]DR29 in the kidneys and improving renal imaging contrast. Positron emission tomography imaging revealed rapid kidney uptake and stable retention over 2 hours. In hypertensive rats, kidney uptake was higher, aligning with AT1R expression levels.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results support [<sup>18</sup>F]DR29 as a promising tool for the noninvasive evaluation of renal AT1R expression in healthy and diseased states. The findings lay the groundwork for clinical translation, offering potential applications in diagnosing and managing kidney-related diseases, including hypertension and other conditions involving AT1R dysregulation.",Chen X; Kimura H; Sasaki T; Klimek K; Mühlig S; Arias-Loza AP; Nose N; Yagi Y; Rowe SP; Lapa C; Werner RA; Higuchi T,"Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Augsburg, Germany (X.C., C.L.).","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2025-08-08,10.1161/hypertensionaha.124.24441,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Angiotensin II type 1 receptor; renin-angiotensin system; Organic Anion Transporters; Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides; Renal Imaging
40769195,Advancement of laparoscopic-guided abdominal approaches in cetacean species.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Surgical procedures in small cetaceans are rarely considered as treatment options due to anatomic considerations limiting exposure, concerns with achieving a watertight incisional closure, and logistical complexities of both anesthesia and surgery in completely aquatic mammals. The objective is to provide a video tutorial on laparoscopic-guided abdominal approaches with the goal to expand diagnostic and treatment capabilities for common diseases in these species.<h4>Animals</h4>Small cetaceans undergoing laparoscopy for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.<h4>Methods</h4>The patient is positioned in dorsolateral recumbency. The initial approach to the abdomen is made at the umbilicus (5- to 10-mm incision). A 10- to 12-mm-diameter X 15-cm-long optical cannula with a 10-mm X 30-cm, 0° laparoscope is inserted. The abdomen is insufflated (10 to 15 mm Hg) and a 30° laparoscope inserted. To access the cranial abdomen, instrument portals are made at 7 and 15 cm cranial to the umbilicus on midline. To access the caudal abdomen, portals are made 15 cm caudal to the umbilicus on midline (midway between the umbilicus and genital slit) and 15 cm lateral to the caudal portal bilaterally. Laparoscopic instruments (grasping forceps, laparoscopic sealing devices) may be inserted to facilitate the procedures.<h4>Results</h4>The cranial approach allows evaluation of the cranial digestive tract, liver, pancreas, and spleen. The caudal approach allows examination of the caudal digestive tract and urinary (kidneys, ureter, urinary bladder) and reproductive systems relevant to common indications for abdominal surgery.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Development of laparoscopic techniques in small cetaceans would mitigate many of the aforementioned surgical challenges, enhancing visualization of intraperitoneal structures and necessitating small incision sizes, leading to more secure closures for early return to aquatic habitats.",Pezzanite LM; Le-Bert C; Lutmerding E; Meegan J; DiRocco S; Robeck T; Hendrickson DA,"1Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO.",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,2025-08-06,10.2460/javma.25.04.0276,2.5,visualization(abstract); visual(abstract),Surgery; Cetacean; Bottlenose dolphin; laparoscopy; Tursiops Truncatus
