      "abstractText": "Mental health is an urgent societal issue, and social scientists are increasingly turning to online mental health communities (OMHCs) to analyze user behavior data for early intervention. However, existing sequence mining techniques fall short of the urgent need to explore the behavior progression of different groups (e.g., recovery or deterioration groups) and track the potential long-term impact of behaviors on mental health status. To address this issue, we introduce EMINDS, a visual analytics system built on a novel automatic mining pipeline that extracts distinct behavior stages and assesses the potential impact of frequent stage patterns on mental health status over time. The system includes a set of interactive visualizations that summarize the meaning of each behavior stage and the evolution of different stage patterns. We feature a pattern-centric Sankey to reveal contextual information about the impact of stage patterns on mental health, helping experts understand the specific changes in sequences before and after a stage pattern. We evaluated the effectiveness and usability of EMINDS through two case studies and expert interviews, which examined the potential stage patterns impacting long-term mental health by analyzing user behaviors on Reddit.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Digital social activity, defined as interactions on social media and electronic communication platforms, has become increasingly important. Social factors impact mental health and can contribute to depression and anxiety. Therefore, incorporating digital social activity into routine mental health care has the potential to improve outcomes.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to compare treatment augmented with an electronic dashboard of patient's digital social activity versus treatment-as-usual on patient-rated outcomes symptoms of depression in a randomized trial of patients with mood and anxiety disorders.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a personalized electronic dashboard summarizing a participant's digital social activity. This dashboard, collaboratively discussed during mental health visits, was used to augment clinical care and tested in a randomized trial against treatment-as-usual. Clinicians and patients were recruited from outpatient psychiatry clinics. Patients were eligible if they were 12 years or older and were receiving treatment for a mood or anxiety disorder. Psychiatric symptoms measures for depression (primary outcome measure) and anxiety (secondary outcome measure) were obtained at each clinic visit as part of measurement-based standard of care. Baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments included a measure of mental health status and therapeutic alliance measure. Collateral information and clinical action scale were also collected at each visit.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 103 patients consented to participate, 97 of whom were randomized to the dashboard arm (n=49) or the treatment-as-usual arm (n=48). There were no differences in psychiatry symptom rating scores or mental health status between the two arms. However, there was a significant increase in the discussion of digital social activity with the intervention, and it did not appear to change patient therapeutic alliance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The incorporation of a personalized electronic dashboard into clinical care was feasible and led to an increased discussion of digital social activity, but there was no impact on mental health outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Digital health tools such as smartphone apps have the potential to improve supportive cancer care. Although numerous smartphone apps for supportive care are available, few are designed using a user-centered approach. Such an approach is crucial for successful implementation, as it may improve user engagement, usability, and adoption in clinical settings.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to co-design and develop a digital health app for supportive cancer care in collaboration with patients with cancer and health care professionals and to explore factors influencing its future acceptance.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a participatory study with the major stakeholders at the University Hospital Zurich. Workshops, individual qualitative interviews, and focus groups were held with health care professionals, survivors of cancer, and patients with cancer. The co-design process was divided into 3 phases: predesign, generative phase, and prototyping. User-centered design methods included scoring cards and think-aloud protocols to co-create design ideas, identify important functionalities, and test usability. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Patients and health care professionals emphasized the need for a digital health app to improve patient-healthcare professional communication, digitalize supportive care screening and processes, and enhance self-efficacy. The resulting app, OncoSupport+, was co-designed and integrated into the clinical workflow for supportive cancer care. It consists of (1) a patient dashboard to record patient-reported outcome measures and to provide access to personalized supportive care information and contact details, and (2) a nurse dashboard to visualize patient data, which can be used during nursing consultations. Potential facilitators for adoption included ease of use, workflow integration, introduction by health care professionals, and technical support, whereas internet anxiety may be a potential barrier.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Collaborative development with patients and health care professionals is crucial for creating digital health tools that can be implemented successfully. Future research should evaluate the feasibility of long-term implementation and the real-world usability and effectiveness of OncoSupport+ for improving communication, self-efficacy, and quality of life.",

      "abstractText": "Endovascular treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is complex due to the intricate angioarchitecture, requiring accurate identification of feeding arteries, draining veins, and the nidus. While 3D digital subtraction angiography (DSA) aids visualization, it lacks vessel-specific segmentation. Embo ASSIST (GE HealthCare, USA) is a software designed to enhance procedural planning and real-time guidance through automatic segmentation and 3D roadmap visualization. This study evaluates the feasibility and clinical utility of Embo ASSIST in brain AVM embolization, focusing on its impact on procedural planning, navigation, radiation exposure, and contrast media use. A retrospective analysis of 19 procedures in 14 patients was conducted between February and August 2021. Images from biplane DSA and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) were processed with Embo ASSIST for vascular segmentation. A structured survey, rated by two senior neuroradiologists, assessed the software's effectiveness. Results showed Embo ASSIST improved procedural planning, with a better understanding of angioarchitecture (3.8/5), pedicle definition (3.9/5), and embolization pathway selection (3.9/5). It allows a reduction of contrast media use (3.7/5), radiation exposure (3.8/5), and procedure time (3.8/5) according to the operators. The software was highly rated for ease of use (3.8/5), CBCT processing speed (4.2/5), and integration with fluoroscopic navigation (4.3/5). However, vein segmentation was limited (3.0/5), requiring manual corrections. In conclusion, Embo ASSIST significantly improved AVM embolization procedures, enhancing visualization, navigation, and efficiency. Future advancements in venous segmentation and AI-based dynamic vessel analysis could optimize treatment further.",

      "abstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is not a single condition and has multiple heterogeneous presentations with several endophenotypes as well as collateral factors affecting care and health. However, clinical consultations globally often miss these important aspects in clinic. The Stepped Care pathway of care was developed from PD patients' opinion and attempts to combine these gaps in care in a simple 3-stage clinical paradigm. We conducted a survey across twenty (20) countries to explore the views of clinicians and PD patients on the process, acceptability and need of the Stepped Care pathway. A structured questionnaire was administered in both affluent and under-resourced clinics, capturing data from a multi-ethnic and diverse patient base. 99% patients (White, Asian and Black) felt Stepped Care toolkit asked relevant questions addressing needs and concerns in PD care that are often missed, and 96% agreed with the importance of using this toolkit during Outpatient Clinic visits. Moreover, a significant majority of PD patients (96%) felt Stepped Care makes them understand their condition better. 92% of clinicians indicated that the Stepped care toolkit could be an effective asset in clinical practice, while 91% of clinicians agreed that the toolkit provides holistic care which is often missed in clinic. This novel global survey of the efficacy and useability of Stepped Care for PD is overwhelmingly endorsed by PD patients and clinicians from a diverse, multi-ethnic background across high- and low- income countries. Stepped Care can be used in clinical practice in order to ensure a holistic and comprehensive care for PD.",

This study examines the evolution of a recovery-oriented mental health system at the federal and state levels in the United States.<h4>Methods</h4>A rapid review of gray literature analyzed federal policy statements, state mental health policies, service reforms, mental health authority reports, websites, organizational records, and other public documents. The review compiled current recovery-oriented system features in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.<h4>Results</h4>Findings highlight expansive but stalled transformation to a recovery-oriented system. Policy statements have made a pronounced shift toward recovery. More recovery-oriented services are being offered. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's uniform reporting system, many outcomes have improved modestly. However, many features of a recovery orientation have not been fully embraced, implemented, and sustained.<h4>Conclusions and implications for practice</h4>Official statements about recovery exist. Practices such as peer services are available in many states, yet the full actualization of a recovery approach remains unfulfilled. Most states would benefit from a concerted effort to fulfill their recovery visions by specifying the features of a recovery-oriented system that they currently lack and aspire to implement. Current implementation science can inform these efforts, including performance-focused, state-level evaluations using common measures tracked on a national dashboard.

      "abstractText": "G-banded chromosome analysis, also known as G-banded karyotyping, remains a fundamental and irreplaceable diagnostic modality in clinical genetic testing. G-banded karyotypes provide whole genome visualization through chromosome banding patterns at the single-cell resolution for the diagnosis of chromosomal disorders. However, this method is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise to manually analyze and karyotype metaphase spreads. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been utilized to automate karyotyping and assist with chromosome analysis. Despite this progress, there is a scarcity of studies evaluating the utility of artificial intelligence-assisted (AI-assisted) karyotyping analysis in cytogenetics diagnostic laboratories. This study highlights promising applications of AI-assisted karyotyping analysis in a cytogenetics diagnostic laboratory through a combination of a literature review, our data, and experience from a retrospective cohort study. This study also discusses important considerations of the use of AI-assisted karyotyping analysis in a cytogenetic diagnostic laboratory and outlines a two-stage framework for its implementation into clinical workflows. This approach aims to utilize the accuracy and efficiency of AI-assisted karyotyping analysis, potentially benefiting personalized patient care and contributing to advancements in the health system.",

However, these biomolecules' structural and functional complexity makes teaching and understanding these topics challenging. To address this difficulty, this study aimed to develop tutorials that facilitate learning and teaching about proteins based on structural analysis and molecular visualization through the interactions of the antigen-antibody complex. Thus, the ChimeraX platform was chosen as the central tool due to its intuitive interface and features that allow the manipulation and visualization of three-dimensional molecules, such as proteins, DNA, and chemical compounds, in .pdb format. The software combines visual and analytical functions, covering from basic to advanced aspects, adapting to the user's level of knowledge. The study presented three practical tutorials: (i) presentation of the tool, (ii) focusing on immunology, and (iii) addressing aspects of biochemistry. These tutorials demonstrated how to use ChimeraX to explore the relationship between protein structure and function, highlighting topics such as molecular interactions and other relevant biochemical processes. In addition, the Tutorials 1 and 2 were validated through the application in a microbiology undergraduate class, followed by a questionnaire and CVI analysis, which confirmed their clarity, relevance, and applicability, reinforcing their role as effective resources for integrating bioinformatics into health-related courses. Thus, the study contributes to disseminating knowledge methods and tools that enable more dynamic and accessible learning through visual and interactive approaches.",

The overlay feature provided by the AI system enhanced visualization and notifications, enabling not only improved safety but also more effective multibranch penetration. As MMA embolization becomes more widespread, especially among younger operators, AI support that combines safety with efficacy holds promise for both clinical practice and training. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings further.neurintsurg;jnis-2025-024452v1/V1F1V1Video 1Artificial intelligence-assisted middle meningeal artery embolization with overlay visualization promoting distal and multibranch penetration.",

      "abstractText": "Viral infections impose a substantial threat to human health, characterized by a wide range of pathogens, clinical manifestations, and complex immune responses. Single-cell multi-omics technologies have revolutionized the study of antiviral immunity by resolving cellular heterogeneity, transcriptional reprogramming, and clonal dynamics. However, no resource has yet comprehensively integrated such datasets in the context of viral infections. Here, we present scMOVIR, a single-cell multi-omics database for human viral infections and immune responses. The database systematically integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and immune receptor repertoire profiles at single-cell resolution, compiling 8532 human samples across 114 viral species, subtypes, and strains. These datasets span 59 well-defined disease states, including acute and chronic infections, virus-associated malignancies, and immune-related disorders, and extend across >30 tissue types. In addition, these datasets incorporate vaccination cohorts, therapeutic interventions, and time-course models of infection. To ensure consistency and interoperability, all datasets undergo standardized preprocessing, including batch correction and unified cell-type annotation, with metadata harmonized using authoritative ontologies. scMOVIR provides user-friendly interfaces for dataset exploration and interactive visualization of cellular dynamics and molecular profiles, offering a high-resolution reference for investigating virus-host immune interactions and supporting antiviral research. The database is freely accessible at\u00a0https://pgx.zju.edu.cn/scmovir.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Augmented reality (AR) superimposes virtual objects onto a real-world environment, allowing users to interact in real time. As AR has become widely used, its integration into smartphones or tablets has enabled mobile augmented reality (MAR) experiences. AR has been adopted in many industries, and the literature has highlighted its applications in academic and clinical settings, particularly in enhancing visualization, communication, and learning.<h4>Objective</h4>This study investigated the potential of MAR as a mobile health tool to enhance shared decision-making (SDM) in thoracic surgery by increasing patient understanding and engagement during medical consultations.<h4>Methods</h4>A randomized crossover clinical trial was conducted at the Tri-Service General Hospital in Taiwan. Participants scheduled for thoracic surgery were enrolled and randomized in a crossover design. The MAR intervention incorporated patient-specific 3D anatomical models that were reconstructed from computed tomography imaging to facilitate understanding and support SDM. The impact of each counseling approach on SDM was evaluated using postintervention questionnaires.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 47 participants were enrolled in this study. After analyzing the data, we found that patients in the MAR group showed significantly higher scores compared to those in the traditional counseling group (P<.001) during the SDM process. Moreover, patients reported higher satisfaction levels and found the visual objects helpful for understanding tumor location and surgical procedures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrated that MAR counseling significantly enhanced patients' comprehension of thoracic conditions and increased their active engagement in the SDM process (P<.001). The integration of patient-specific 3D anatomical models into MAR technology provided an intuitive method for critical medical information. This digital approach not only enhanced personalization in medical communication but also reinforced patient education about their health care conditions. These findings suggest that MAR counseling represents a promising approach for promoting patient-centered care in thoracic surgery and has potential applications across various clinical domains.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT07062393; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07062393.",

      "abstractText": "Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 women globally. We aimed to determine health provider involvement and preferred methods of obtaining an endometriosis diagnosis across international jurisdictions. A global cross-sectional survey, distributed through formal and informal FIGO Reproductive Medicine, Endocrinology, and Infertility (REI) committee networks from September through October 2024. A total of 445 respondents from 76 countries began the survey, with 360 completions. Of the respondents, 63.9% were female, with most being gynecologists. Academics and/or researchers comprised 6.7%, with 39.2% involved in research in some capacity. Endometriosis was largely diagnosed by gynecologists (95.0%), with most respondents overall describing ultrasound as the most common method of diagnosis (77.8%). Of those surveyed, 93.6% stated clinicians in their country used non-invasive imaging (predominantly ultrasound) to diagnose endometriosis before surgery. One third of respondents did not feel confident distinguishing between routine gynecological scans and specialist endometriosis imaging. Significant barriers for uptake of imaging diagnostics included access to training, cost, and geographical accessibility. Regarding adoption of non-invasive imaging in clinical care, \"game-changing\" effects were described, including improvements in surgical preoperative mapping, and patient-centered care, with concerns that it could increase clinical workloads. Significantly, shifts in endometriosis diagnosis, from visualization of lesions at laparoscopy to non-invasive imaging diagnostics, were observed internationally. Policies should aim to overcome barriers to uptake of imaging-based diagnostics by supporting training initiatives, reducing associated costs, and improving geographical accessibility. Respondents predicted transformative changes in endometriosis care once non-invasive endometriosis diagnostics are effectively adopted.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The significance of mobile health (mHealth) apps transforms traditional health care delivery and enables individuals to actively manage their health. The success and effectiveness of mHealth apps heavily depend on the user experience and satisfaction. Previous studies have examined mHealth adoption through systematic literature reviews, focusing on mental health, chronic disease management, fitness, and public health responses to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the state of research, the key trends, themes, and gaps in the user experience and satisfaction with mHealth apps remain unexplored.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to investigate the state of research on user experience in mHealth apps through a bibliometric analysis. Furthermore, the study aims to systematically identify research trends and themes by extending the analysis of the science mapping technique, co-word analysis, and bibliographic coupling.<h4>Methods</h4>The bibliographic data corpus was collected from Scopus and Web of Science and systematically analyzed using bibliometric performance analysis and science mapping techniques. The methodology incorporates various data processing and visualization tools, including VOS Viewer, OriginLab, and SiteSpace. Then, a comprehensive review metric, combining the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework and a 4-step approach from data collection to interpretation is used.<h4>Results</h4>The bibliographic analysis spans 16 years and includes 814 unique publications authored by 4870 researchers from 81 countries and 1948 organizations, published across 351 high-impact journals and prominent conferences. The analysis of research trends identifies 2 key trends: the differentiation in keyword usage for user experience and user satisfaction, and the research methodologies used within the domain. Furthermore, 5 research themes were identified exploring critical aspects of technology use, user engagement, and clinical integration. Although all 5 themes overlap, each theme focuses on distinct elements that help delineate their contributions to the overall understanding of mHealth apps: technological evaluation (Theme 1), design features for engagement (Theme 2), patient usability (Theme 3), long-term engagement factors (Theme 4), and clinical integration (Theme 5).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study offers a fundamental understanding of the bibliographic landscape of research on user experience and satisfaction with mHealth apps. By identifying major research clusters, influential works, and emerging topics, this analysis provides evidence-based guidance for researchers, developers, and health informatics practitioners. Furthermore, based on the research trends findings, future research should prioritize expanding the scope of user experience (UX) evaluation by incorporating diverse user populations, longitudinal studies, and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and personalized interventions. Integrating insights from interdisciplinary perspectives such as human-computer interaction, behavioral sciences, and health care informatics, the understanding of user needs and app effectiveness can be enhanced. A more standardized framework for assessing UX in mHealth apps is also recommended to facilitate comparability across studies and improve app design to maximize user engagement and health outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The risk of depression is significantly elevated in middle-aged and older adults with insomnia; however, the pathways between mild and severe insomnia are different. Most existing prediction tools treat insomnia as a single construct, ignoring its heterogeneity. It is crucial to develop an interpretable, severity-specific modeling framework to quantify depression risk, identify shared determinants, and guide targeted prevention efforts.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed 2433 participants (\u226545\u00a0years) from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Insomnia was classified as mild (5-6\u00a0h) or severe (<5\u00a0h). Depression was measured with the 10-item CES-D. After LASSO selection of demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors, nine machine-learning algorithms were trained and compared; interpretability was provided by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).<h4>Results</h4>Random Forest performed best (AUC\u00a00.7784 for mild insomnia, 0.7554 for severe insomnia), with good calibration and decision-curve utility. Older age, female gender, poor self-rated health, and multimorbidity consistently elevated risk, whereas life satisfaction, functional independence, cognitive reserve, and education were protective. Both models are deployed in a Streamlit web app that delivers individual risk scores and SHAP-based explanations in real time.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study introduces parallel, explainable random forest models that stratify depression risk by insomnia severity, revealing universal vulnerabilities alongside severity-specific drivers. Implemented in a web-based tool with SHAP visualization, the framework supports rapid, stratified screening and tailored counseling in community and primary-care settings with limited specialist resources. By linking interpretable AI with severity-aware insights, this work advances precision prevention of depression in sleep-disturbed middle-aged and older populations.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The global rise in multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections poses a serious threat to public health, largely driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. In this context, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their postbiotic metabolites have attracted attention for their natural antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of LAB-derived postbiotics against four clinically relevant pathogens: Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, and a clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae.<h4>Results</h4>LAB strains were isolated from traditional fermented dairy products in Menoufia, Egypt, including Kareish cheese, Rayeb milk, and local yoghurt, using MRS agar medium. Among twelve active isolates, strain EH1 demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity. Identification via VITEK 2 and 16\u00a0S rRNA sequencing confirmed the isolate as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. Optimal culture conditions for EH1 included 48\u00a0h incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, pH 7.0, with yeast extract and sucrose as the preferred nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Antibiofilm activity was confirmed through Congo red agar assay, agar well diffusion, ELISA-based quantification, and visualization by SEM and TEM, all indicating substantial disruption of biofilm structure and cell morphology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Postbiotics produced by L. plantarum exhibited strong antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against resistant bacterial strains. These results highlight the promising potential of LAB-derived metabolites as natural, safe, and effective alternatives for inhibiting biofilm formation and mitigating the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.",

      "abstractText": "Air pollution has emerged as a major public health concern, being implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases. This study investigates the underlying associations between air pollutants and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Target genes associated with both air pollutants and HCC were obtained through integration of multiple bioinformatics databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and visualization were performed on overlapping genes, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses to elucidate potential mechanistic pathways. A predictive model was developed using LASSO regression and validated on external datasets. Core genes were identified through consensus across multiple topological algorithms, with their clinical relevance further explored. Finally, molecular docking analysis was conducted to investigate interaction patterns between core genes and airborne pollutants at the structural level. Integrated multi-database analyses identified 48 air pollutant-HCC associated genes. Functional enrichment through GO and KEGG revealed these targets predominantly regulate apoptosis and oncogenic pathways. Survival analysis demonstrated robust predictive capacity of the LASSO-derived prognostic model, which maintained strong stability and reliability in external validation cohorts. CDK1 and TERT emerged as core genes from multi-algorithm screening, strongly correlated with HCC pathological progression. Molecular docking simulations further confirmed stable binding conformations between particulate matter components and these core targets at atomic resolution. Our study elucidates the critical roles of CDK1 and TERT between air pollutants and hepatocellular carcinoma, thereby providing novel molecular insights into air pollution-driven hepatocarcinogenesis.",

DHM is an advanced technology that utilizes optical interference principles for non-invasive imaging, providing high-resolution three-dimensional visualization of cells and macromolecules without requiring markers. In proteomics, DHM provides crucial technical support for investigating protein interactions and enables high-precision tracking and analysis of dynamic protein changes. In this review, we systematically survey peer-reviewed literature published in the past five years, with a focus on experimental and clinical studies applying DHM to proteomic analyses. Based on the significant advantages of this technology, we introduce the concept of \"Holographic proteomics\" as an emerging research field with promising future directions.",

      "abstractText": "Rare diseases are collectively common, affecting approximately 1 in 20 individuals worldwide. In recent years, rapid progress has been made in rare disease diagnostics due to advances in next-generation sequencing, development of new computational and functional genomics approaches to prioritize genes and variants and increased global sharing of clinical and genetic data. However, more than half of individuals suspected to have a rare disease lack a genetic diagnosis. The Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR) Consortium was initiated to study thousands of challenging rare disease cases and families and apply, standardize and evaluate emerging genomics technologies and analytics to accelerate their adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, all data generated, currently representing over 7,500 individuals from over 3,000 families, are rapidly made available to researchers worldwide through the Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) to catalyse global efforts to develop approaches for genetic diagnoses in rare diseases. Most of these families have undergone previous clinical genetic testing but remained unsolved, with most being exome-negative. Here we describe the collaborative research framework, datasets and discoveries comprising GREGoR that will provide foundational resources and substrates for the future of rare disease genomics.",

      "abstractText": "Glycosylation is a crucial biochemical modification of proteins and other biomolecules in cells that generates an exceptional structural and functional diversity. Aberrant glycosylation is implicated in numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. While glycan organization at the cell surface is studied extensively, the nanoscale spatial arrangement of glycans inside cells and within organelles remains largely unexplored. Here, super-resolution imaging with fluorophore-labeled lectins, combined with a dedicated multiplexing strategy (Glyco-STORM), was used in thin neuronal tissue sections and permeabilized cells to systematically map glycosylation across multiple organelles and cellular compartments. Lectin markers were identified that enabled the visualization of nanodomains within the endoplasmic reticulum, subdomains along the Golgi axes, diverse glycosylation states in the endolysosomal system, and a polarized lysosomal clathrin coat. At neuronal synapses, mature glycans were found to demarcate the synaptic cleft and subsynaptic tubules adjacent to the postsynaptic density. In summary, Glyco-STORM establishes one of the first comprehensive nanoscale maps of intracellular glycosylation and provides entry points into health- and disease-related studies.",

      "abstractText": "Despite advances in the fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), many issues related to ICH management remain understudied with discrepancies in management. Given the high disease severity and prevalence, consensus recommendations are urgently needed to guide further research and management strategies. Thus, a group of clinical experts, industry leaders, and government representatives was assembled to examine emerging approaches in ICH management and their future impact on patient care. The timing of intervention within 24 hours and the role of minimally invasive evacuation, particularly for basal ganglia hemorrhage locations, were identified as key research focuses to guide future trial design. Mobile stroke units and artificial intelligence (AI) are promising technologies that streamline preoperative and triaging workflows and improve time to intervention. Efforts to further develop surgical technologies will be crucial to improve ICH visualization and evacuation. Further research, industry collaboration, and investment are needed to advance treatment frontiers and catalyze ICH research.",

      "abstractText": "Reversing initial gains realized in the 1990s-2010s, coronary artery disease rates are now increasing and represent the dominant cause of death in many parts of the world. In recent years, substantive advances in non-invasive and invasive structural-based imaging techniques that delineate atheroma burden and anatomical composition have increased understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Driven by advances in imaging agent and hardware technology, the burgeoning field of molecular imaging has enabled clinical visualization of molecules and cells that underpin atherosclerosis pathobiology. Integrating the molecular and anatomical measures of atherosclerosis has promoted a deeper understanding of disease progression, patient-specific risk, and the effects of atherosclerosis pharmacotherapeutics and devices. With the great recognition of the role of inflammation as a residual risk marker of adverse outcomes for coronary artery disease patients, cellular and molecular imaging of inflammation and other disease activities is positioned to usher in a new era of risk assessment and personalized medical and interventional therapeutics for atherosclerosis patients. Moreover, molecular imaging offers the potential for assessing the actions of interventions on atherogenic processes, validating effects in vivo, and possibly informing optimal dose selection and treatment duration. This review will present the state-of-the-art in coronary artery disease cellular and molecular imaging and provide a roadmap for near-term translational and clinical applications.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in healthcare, requiring rapid detection and intervention. This paper presents a scalable, serverless machine learning (ML) operations architecture for near real-time sepsis risk-stratification in Emergency Department (ED) waiting rooms, where pathology data is often unavailable and recognising sepsis presents the biggest opportunity for timely treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>The system integrates HL7 message processing through MuleSoft in a secure Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment, leveraging AWS services such as Lambda for real-time data processing and SageMaker for ML model deployment. To optimise the model's performance, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate different cutoff thresholds of probability across different age groups (16-35, 35-65, and 65-115), aiming for >80% sensitivity and minimise false negatives. Processed data is stored in Aurora PostgreSQL Relational Database Service and visualised in an on-premises proprietary dashboard for clinical decision support.<h4>Results</h4>Despite high reliability, with 99.7% of HL7 messages successfully processed, limitations include occasional failures due to downtime and code set mismatches, as well as peak execution times of 10.5\u2005s under heavy loads, highlighting areas for optimisation. Model development of eligible ED encounters (n\u2009=\u2009 484,617) using XG Boost was integrated as a real-time endpoint in SageMaker. The Extreme Gradient Boosting model achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.84) and F1-score (0.80), with balanced sensitivity and specificity for our specified limited features within an ED. ROC for age groups (16-35, 36-65, 66-115), showed strong performance in all cohorts (AUCs: 0.864, 0.867, 0.806).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This paper outlines the system's design, implementation, and potential for enhancing early sepsis risk-stratification through near real-time monitoring in the ED waiting room.",

      "abstractText": "Protein unfolding has emerged as a critical factor in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Direct visualization of unfolded proteins remains technically challenging yet critical for elucidating atherosclerosis pathogenesis and developing early diagnostic tools. Here, we report a dual-reporter unlocking two-photon fluorescence probe for dynamic tracking of unfolded proteins in early atherosclerotic plaques. The probe achieves synergistic fluorescence activation through covalent binding with exposed thiols and subsequent stabilization within the local hydrophobic microenvironment of unfolded proteins. This dual-activation property allows for precise differentiation between folded and unfolded proteins in foam cells, facilitating spatiotemporal mapping of protein disorder at various stages of atherosclerosis. Notably, the probe detects early-stage unknown or tiny plaques within 4 to 8 weeks by identifying protein unfolding events before conventional Oil Red O staining and clinical ultrasonography, demonstrating unprecedented sensitivity for subclinical plaque prediction. Our findings establish a paradigm for investigating proteostasis disorder in atherogenesis and introduce a powerful molecular tool for early atherosclerosis diagnosis.",

This study investigates the presence, types, and distribution of microplastics in rural drinking water systems in southern Ecuador, with a focus on their association with land-based anthropogenic activities-agriculture, livestock, and local industry. A total of 169 samples were collected from 29 community-managed systems; 61.5% tested positive for MPs. Detected polymers included polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide 6, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyester. PET was the most frequently observed, reaching concentrations up to 20 particles per sample, particularly in livestock-dominated catchments. More chemically complex MPs (e.g., PVC, thermoplastics) were predominantly detected in zones with industrial influence. Statistical analysis and spatial visualization (heatmaps) revealed strong correlations between MP distribution and land use type, suggesting that rural MP contamination originates from diffuse and localized terrestrial sources. These findings highlight the potential for MPs to infiltrate groundwater systems via poorly managed soil-water interfaces in rural settings. The results support the urgent need for targeted monitoring, plastic waste control, and water infrastructure improvements to mitigate risks to groundwater and public health.",

The overarching goal is to facilitate safer percutaneous interventions by minimizing exposure while maintaining imaging adequacy.<h4>Methods</h4>A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted, evaluating two 3DRA acquisition protocols with distinct exposure parameters. Image quality was assessed subjectively by two cardiologists using Likert scales and objectively through signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements. Particular attention was given to the visualization of cardiovascular structures and the overall clinical utility of the images.<h4>Results</h4>The low-dose protocol achieved a significant reduction in radiation dose (p = 0.009). SNR values were significantly higher in the low-dose group (p < 0.05), while qualitative assessments showed only minor differences between protocols. Image quality and procedural usefulness remained consistently diagnostic in all cases.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Significant dose reduction in 3DRA is achievable without compromising diagnostic performance, supporting safer imaging practices for this radiosensitive patient population.<h4>Implications for practice</h4>Optimized 3DRA protocols provide a meaningful reduction in radiation exposure for pediatric CHD patients while preserving procedural efficacy, reinforcing their adoption in routine clinical practice.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background and aims</h4>Small bowel bleeding poses a significant diagnostic challenge for clinicians, and capsule endoscopy is currently considered the investigation of choice for evaluating suspected cases. However, evidence regarding the role of second-look endoscopy before capsule endoscopy is limited. This study aimed to evaluate capsule endoscopy findings after a negative second-look endoscopy in patients with suspected small bowel bleeding at a tertiary care center in Sri Lanka.<h4>Method</h4>This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed data from patients who underwent capsule endoscopy for suspected small bowel bleeding at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka from June 1, 2018, to March 31, 2023. All patients had negative results on second-look endoscopies and abdominal imaging (CT, MRI, Enterography). The principal investigator reassessed all the capsule recordings at 3-6 frames per second in single-image viewing mode. The study primarily evaluated demographic data, capsule endoscopy findings, and mucosal visualization. Continuous variables were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation or median. Comparisons for continuous variables were performed using independent-sample t-test and categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. A two-sided p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>The sample size was 71, with a mean age of 54.41\u2009\u00b1\u200918.44 years. 60.6% of patients were males. Overt bleeding occurred in 52.1% of patients, while occult bleeding occurred in 47.9%. The mean small intestine transit time was 5:16:30\u2009\u00b1\u20091:48:01\u00a0h. Hemoglobin was significantly lower (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in patients with overt bleeding, with a mean level of 9.27\u2009\u00b1\u20091.27\u00a0g/dL. Capsule endoscopy identified 30 patients (42.3%) with a definite cause for small bowel bleeding and 22 patients (31.0%) with a probable cause, resulting in an overall diagnostic yield of 73.2%. The proximal small intestine was the most commonly affected segment of the small bowel in cases of small bowel bleeding, accounting for 33 patients (46.5%). None of the patients had lesions in the endoscopically accessible sites of the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. We noted vascular findings in 18 patients (25.4%), with inflammatory findings accounting for the majority (n\u2009=\u200930/42.3%). The predominant treatment option was medical management (71.8%), followed by endoscopic interventions (26.8%) and interventional radiological interventions (2.8%). The number of polyethylene glycol sachets used for bowel preparation did not affect the diagnostic yield or mucosal visualization quality.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Capsule endoscopy demonstrated a high diagnostic yield in Sri Lankan patients with suspected small bowel bleeding who had normal initial and second-look endoscopies. The proximal small intestine was the commonest involved segment, and, contrary to previous studies, inflammatory lesions were the predominant finding. We recommend low-volume bowel preparation as the number of polyethylene glycol sachets did not affect the diagnostic yield or quality of mucosal visualization. This study supports integrating capsule endoscopy into routine clinical practice for evaluating gastrointestinal bleeding and recommends performing a second-look endoscopy before proceeding to capsule endoscopy.",

The project has produced >1400 candidate mouse models of human disease that recapitulate phenotypes observed in patients. Over 8000 papers rely on data or reagents generated by IMPC, demonstrating the impact of the project on the research and clinical communities, and IMPC data is incorporated into other resources, such as MGI, Open Targets, and UniProt. Data release (DR23.0, 2025) contains >100 million data points from 9277 genes and identified 113 803 significant phenotypes. To manage efficient access to this quantity of high dimensional data the IMPC web portal has been rebuilt using a cloud native architecture. The modern user interface retains the look and feel of the original portal with improvements identified through a usability study. New data visualization and training materials for large scale data access through the API have also been developed to make the resource easier to use.",

      "abstractText": "M\u00e9n\u00e9trier's disease (MD) is a rare, acquired premalignant condition characterized by hypertrophic gastropathy. Its defining features include giant gastric rugal folds, predominantly in the fundus and body of the stomach, foveolar hyperplasia with glandular atrophy, and a protein-losing gastropathy leading to hypoalbuminemia and peripheral edema. The pathogenesis is primarily driven by the overactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway, most commonly due to the overexpression of its ligand, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-\u03b1). The clinical presentation varies significantly between pediatric and adult populations. In children, the disease is often acute, self-limiting, and strongly associated with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. In adults, it typically follows a chronic and progressive course, carrying a significant risk for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis is challenging and relies on a combination of endoscopic visualization, histopathological analysis of deep or full-thickness biopsies, and advanced imaging techniques such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to differentiate it from its mimics, which include gastric lymphoma and infiltrative carcinoma. Management strategies have evolved from supportive care, such as high-protein diets and treatment of associated infections like Helicobacter pylori, to targeted molecular therapies. The monoclonal antibody Cetuximab, which blocks EGFR, has emerged as a highly effective treatment, capable of inducing clinical and histological remission. Somatostatin analogues like octreotide and lanreotide also offer symptomatic control by inhibiting growth factor signaling. For patients with refractory symptoms, severe complications, or malignant transformation, surgical intervention via partial or total gastrectomy remains the definitive treatment. This review provides a detailed examination of the current understanding of the molecular underpinnings, diverse clinical spectrum, diagnostic modalities, and therapeutic landscape of MD.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Effective decision-making is essential in nursing but often underdeveloped in students and novice nurses. Eye-tracking offers a real-time, objective way to study decision processes.<h4>Methods</h4>A pilot observational study was conducted, dividing nursing students into high- and low-experience groups based on internship exposure. Participants performed intravenous infusion preparation tasks of varying complexity. Eye-tracking and visualization techniques were used to analyze gaze patterns and decision-making trajectories.<h4>Results</h4>Under low-complexity conditions, both groups showed fewer fixations and shorter durations. As complexity increased, low-experience students exhibited more and longer fixations with frequent gaze shifts, while high-experience students maintained shorter fixation times, fewer transitions, and more organized attention.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Task complexity and clinical experience may influence decision-making. Higher task complexity prompted a shift from intuitive to analytical processing, occurring earlier among less-experienced students. Findings support incorporating complexity-based tasks and expanded practice into nursing education to foster efficient, patient-centered decision-making skills.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Freshwater chironomid midges pose a significant threat to drinking water quality and freshwater ecosystems in South Korea by disrupting ecological balance and causing biofouling in drinking water treatment systems. To enable rapid detection and provide early warnings of chironomid presence, we developed a highly sensitive and accurate diagnostic assay based on environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis. This method integrates recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated cleavage, and visualization through either fluorescence-based detection or a lateral flow assay (LFA).<h4>Results</h4>The RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assays demonstrated remarkable specificity for chironomid eDNA, as confirmed through field surveys and microscopic observations. Although both fluorescence-based and LFA-based RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assays exhibited comparable detection limits of 10 copies/\u03bcL, the LFA method proved more convenient for on-site applications due to its ease of deployment in the field.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our eDNA-based RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay addresses the limitations of traditional biomonitoring by requiring only a small sampling volume, thereby minimizing habitat disturbance, while offering much higher sensitivity. This assay represents a valuable tool for on-site detection of invasive species and for monitoring environmental and public health threats (e.g., chironomids). \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a widely adopted approach in the treatment of breast cancer, personalizing the intensity of subsequent adjuvant therapy remains a major clinical challenge due to tumor heterogeneity and the lack of reliable biomarkers. Existing strategies fall short in identifying patients who could benefit from intensive adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly among non-pCR cases. To address this, we developed a foundation model that integrates histopathology and clinical data to support individualized treatment decisions.<h4>Methods</h4>We collected whole-slide images and clinical data from 1,543 patients with non-metastatic invasive breast cancer who underwent planned NAC prior to surgery, across three cohorts: training cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0756), validation cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0560), and test cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0227). A hybrid AI-pathology model was developed, combining a convolutional neural networks (CNN) branch and a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole-slide images. This architecture enabled robust feature extraction from histopathological slides. These features were integrated with clinical data in a multimodal framework to predict pathological complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival (DFS).<h4>Results</h4>The proposed hybrid AI-multimodal model demonstrated superior performance for pCR, achieving an AUC of 0.999 in both the training and validation cohorts. Integration with clinicopathological data yielded a multimodal model with enhanced predictive accuracy for both pCR and DFS, showing high AUCs across all cohorts, including 0.994 for pCR and 0.885 for 4-year DFS in the blinded test cohort. Notably, among non-pCR patients classified as high- or medium-risk by the AI-multimodal model, significant differences in DFS were observed across those who received intensive, standard, or no adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, visualization heatmaps offered interpretability by linking model predictions to tumor microenvironment features, providing insights into the biological basis of treatment response.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This foundation model integrating histopathological and clinical data enables accurate prediction of NAC response and long-term outcomes in breast cancer. Beyond prognostication, it offers a clinically actionable tool for identifying high-risk non-pCR patients who may benefit from intensive adjuvant chemotherapy, advancing precision oncology in the neoadjuvant setting.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Early detection of duodenal neoplasms is crucial because of the complications associated with their treatment and their increasing recognition. However, standardised protocols for duodenal observation during screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) have not been established. This study was performed to survey the current practical status of duodenal observation and to evaluate the clinical relevance of our systematic photo-documentation protocol, known as the Seven Pictures Rule (7PR).<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional survey using a web-based self-administered questionnaire was conducted among endoscopists in a regional area of Japan. The questionnaire included items on respondents' professional background, duodenal observation practices during screening EGD (observed locations, observation time, ampulla visualization, and patient discomfort), as well as awareness, application, and perceived effects of the 7PR, and preferences for future protocols. Data were anonymized and analyzed descriptively.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 99 endoscopists included, 96.7% reported observing the duodenum based on their own individual methods. The intentional observation rates by location were highest in the following order: bulb (99%), ampulla in descending (94%), contralateral ampulla in descending (84%), superior duodenal angle (77%), contralateral superior duodenal angle (79%), and transverse duodenum (33%). However, only 14% of respondents reported successfully observing the ampulla in more than 75% of cases. While 62% were aware of the 7PR, only one-fourth had implemented it in practice. Notably, 43% of respondents familiar with the 7PR felt that it had led to an increased detection of duodenal neoplasms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Current duodenal observation practices vary among endoscopists. The establishment of a systematic photo-documentation protocol such as the 7PR may serve as a useful strategy for improving the detection of duodenal neoplasms. Further optimisation of the protocol is warranted to support broader adoption in clinical settings.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Dementia presents a significant global health burden, with an increasing prevalence and considerable economic implications. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the number of dementia patients has steadily increased, highlighting the need for more accurate risk stratification. Traditional methods of patient classification often assume homogeneity, limiting their ability to identify subgroups at varying levels of mortality risk. This study explored the potential of graph attention networks (GATs) in addressing this gap, aiming to better characterize high-risk dementia subgroups in the ICU and improve clinical outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>This study utilized anonymized patient data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III datasets. Dementia patients were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, with exclusions based on specific admission criteria, resulting in the inclusion of 7904 patients. A comprehensive set of demographics, comorbidities, ICU severity scores, and laboratory parameters was selected. Three unsupervised clustering methods were employed: a graph autoencoder (GAE), a graph attention autoencoder (GAT), and K-means combined with UMAP-based dimensionality reduction. The optimal number of clusters (k\u2009=\u20093) was determined by maximizing the silhouette scores and Calinski-Harabasz indices. The GAT method quantitatively outperformed both the GAE and K-means methods, achieving superior cluster separation (MIMIC-IV: highest silhouette score: 0.090; Calinski-Harabasz: 345.501; Davies-Bouldin: 2.30; MIMIC-III: highest silhouette score: 0.210; Calinski-Harabasz: 380.620; Davies-Bouldin: 1.850). Three distinct subgroups were identified: Cluster 1 represented the highest-risk phenotype, characterized by advanced age, coagulopathy, anemia, and organ dysfunction, with a strikingly elevated mortality risk (HR\u2009=\u200921.58, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Compared with the unstratified cohort, the machine learning models trained on the MIMIC-IV and validated on the MIMIC-III cohort showed improved predictive performance (AUC up to 0.85 within clusters). SHAP analysis revealed cluster-specific drivers, including a prolonged length of stay, renal impairment, and inflammatory markers. Visualization of the subgroups was achieved via sunburst plots, radar charts, and boxplots.<h4>Results</h4>This study included 7904 patients, who were divided into two groups: the nonoccurrence group (n\u2009=\u20095,038) and the occurrence group (n\u2009=\u20092,866). Baseline characteristics, including demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors, significantly differed between the groups. Unsupervised clustering methods identified distinct patient subgroups, with the GAT algorithm outperforming K-means and GCN in clustering both cohorts. Cox regression revealed that the GAT identified high-risk groups, with mortality significantly higher in Cluster 1 (HR\u2009=\u200921.58, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Cluster analysis revealed that Cluster 1 had the highest mortality risk and was characterized by advanced age, severe renal dysfunction, and poor clinical outcomes. To validate the superiority of the GAT-based unsupervised clustering approach, we applied various machine learning algorithms, which demonstrated enhanced predictive performance across the identified subgroups. The feature distributions and interrelationships were visualized using radar plots, boxplots, and SHAP analysis. SHAP further revealed distinct risk profiles: Cluster 0 was associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events and acute kidney injury; Cluster 1 reflected a high metabolic stress state indicative of early systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis; and Cluster 2 was primarily marked by severe renal failure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrates the effectiveness of GAT-based clustering for identifying high-risk subgroups among dementia patients in the ICU. By providing more granular risk stratification, these models can support clinical decision-making and improve patient management. These findings underscore the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing ICU care for dementia patients, with future research focusing on temporal validation and integration into clinical workflows to optimize outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "Unlocking the full potential of metabolomics hinges on significantly improving the detection of metabolites, particularly those containing hydroxyl groups, which often remain challenging to ionize. Our previous work established 2-(4-Boronobenzyl) isoquinolin-2-ium bromide (BBII) as a highly effective derivatization reagent for enhancing hydroxyl metabolite sensitivity in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Building upon this, we herein introduce a novel and robust extension: BBII derivatization integrated with desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) for <i>in situ</i> hydroxyl metabolite detection. This innovative approach involves incorporating BBII directly into the DESI spray solvent, leading to significant sensitivity enhancement through instantaneous derivatization reaction. We demonstrate substantial signal increases ranging from 1.8- to 17.2-fold for hydroxyl metabolite reference standards, making previously undetectable compounds such as glucose, hexadecanol, and estradiol readily observable. When applied to mouse brain tissue sections for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), BBII-DESI successfully revealed the distinct spatial distributions of representative hydroxyl metabolites, including glucose and cholesterol that are typically invisible to conventional methods. A key advantage of this methodology is the characteristic boron isotopic pattern of BBII-derivatized features, facilitating rapid and precise screening and identification. This BBII-assisted DESI strategy effectively unveils the \"dark metabolome\" of hydroxyl compounds, providing access to previously inaccessible metabolic information. Our method broadens the utility of ambient ionization techniques by enabling direct analysis of biological samples with minimal preparation, which is crucial for high-throughput applications. This advance offers substantial potential for accelerating biomarker discovery and disease diagnostics through direct visualization of metabolic alterations within native tissue environments, thereby marking a significant leap forward in spatial metabolomics applications for health and disease research.",

      "abstractText": "Accurate estimation of cattle weight is essential for effective farm management, health assessment, and productivity optimization. Traditional manual methods for weight estimation, however, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to inaccuracies. Recent advances in computer vision have facilitated the automation of weight prediction from image data. However, traditional regression models, such as Random Forest and Linear Regression, face challenges in capturing the complex, nonlinear relationships within image data, leading to less accurate predictions. To address these issues, we introduce CattleNet-XAI, a framework designed for both efficiency and explainability, which utilizes a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For the CNN-based approach, we incorporated advanced image preprocessing techniques, including normalization and histogram equalization, to enhance the input data quality. We compared its performance with other CNN models, the pretrained EfficientNetB3 model, and traditional machine learning methods like Random Forest and Linear Regression. For the traditional methods, we first leveraged the YOLOv5 algorithm for precise feature extraction from the cattle images. All the models were trained and evaluated on a dataset of cattle images and associated weight data, with performance measured by Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Our results show that one variation of our custom CNN (3Conv3Dense) model significantly surpasses other conventional models, achieving a low MAE of 18.02 kg and an RMSE of 19.85 kg, which demonstrates superior accuracy. We also present LIME visualization and error case analysis to provide insights into the decision-making process of the model. This study emphasizes the capability of deep learning, especially CNN, in automating and enhancing the precision of livestock weight estimation, offering a modern and effective approach to cattle management.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Independently investigating the association between pregnancy outcomes and the uterine cavity conception environment (UCCE) is challenging. Therefore, this study aimed to employ a range of machine learning algorithms to systematically analyze the semantic features derived from two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) images that characterize the UCCE.<h4>Methods</h4>This case-control study was conducted at the Women and Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Preoperative TVUS findings in patients diagnosed with infertility who subsequently achieved clinical pregnancy within 1 year following hysteroscopic intervention alone were classified as abnormal UCCE (case group), whereas TVUS findings in the uterine cavity of women who successfully achieved clinical pregnancy through follicular monitoring during the same cycle were classified as normal UCCE (control group). We randomly divided 442 participants (cases, n\u2009=\u2009244; controls, n\u2009=\u2009198) into the training (n\u2009=\u2009309) and testing (n\u2009=\u2009133) sets. A structured description of the ultrasonic semantic features of UCCE was derived by integrating the images and diagnostic reports. To employ logistic regression (LR), the Boruta algorithm, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator for univariate feature selection, and five machine learning models-LR, random forest (RF), XGBoost, support vector machines (SVM), and LightGBM-were constructed, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their predictive performance. Additionally, the Shapley additive explanation technology was employed to elucidate the output results from the best-performing model. A nomogram was created for diagnostic prediction model visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Endometrial thickness, echogenicity, polyps, polyp size, continuity and uterine morphology, and septum type were the semantic features with the highest UCCE predictive value. In the testing set, XGBoost and LightGBM showed the highest (0.982) and lowest (0.902) area under the curve (AUC), respectively. XGBoost, SVM, RF, and MLR attained excellent prediction accuracy (0\u2009<\u2009Brier score\u2009<\u20090.1) across the training and testing sets. Decision-curve analysis demonstrated that all models provided substantial net clinical benefits. A significant difference was observed in the nomoscore between the normal and abnormal UCCE groups (p\u2009<\u2009.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Machine learning models using semantic features derived from two-dimensional TVUS images enabled accurate preliminary screening for natural conception preparation or before embryo implantation.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>This study evaluates the surgical and audiological outcomes of transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES) in patients with congenital ossicular chain anomalies (COCAs) using the Teunissen-Cremers classification system.<h4>Study design</h4>Multicenter, retrospective clinical study.<h4>Setting</h4>Tertiary referral centers with experienced endoscopic ear surgeons.<h4>Patients</h4>A total of 51 patients were diagnosed with COCAs and treated with TEES. Patients with chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, tympanosclerosis, otosclerosis, or those requiring microscopic/endaural/retroauricular approaches were excluded.<h4>Intervention</h4>Transcanal endoscopic ossicular chain reconstructions were performed using various techniques, including stapedotomy, partial and total ossicular prosthesis or autologous bone or cartilage graft placements, and bone cement bridging.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Air-bone gap (ABG) closure, operation duration, hospital stay, and postoperative complications.<h4>Results</h4>The mean preoperative ABG was 42.5\u00b110.9\u00a0dB HL, which improved to a mean postoperative ABG of 20.3\u00b112.3\u00a0dB HL, yielding a mean ABG closure of 22.3\u00b112.2\u00a0dB HL. Patients classified as Class 1, 2, and 3 demonstrated significantly greater ABG closure rates compared with Class 4 cases (P<0.059). The mean surgical duration was 72.1\u00b119.9 minutes, and the mean hospital stay was 29.6\u00b115.3 hours. No intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications were observed. Five patients required revision surgery due to recurrent conductive hearing loss.<h4>Conclusions</h4>TEES is a safe and effective technique for managing COCAs, offering significant ABG improvement, particularly in Class 1 to 3 anomalies. The minimally invasive nature of TEES, combined with superior exposure and visualization, results in favorable audiological outcomes with minimal complications and reduced hospital stay.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is a vision-impairing condition characterized by partial or complete vision loss due to mechanical or ischemic damage to the optic nerve following trauma. This pathology manifests as structural disruptions, including optic nerve fiber discontinuity, neuronal necrosis, and vascular compromise, ultimately impairing axonal conduction. Clinical presentations typically include diminished visual acuity, blurred vision, and scotomas.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection database, yielding 1012 publications for bibliometric analysis. Data processing and visualization were performed using VOSviewer, R Studio's bibliometrix package, and CiteSpace. Analytical parameters encompassed national contributions, institutional productivity, author impact, keyword co-occurrence, and co-citation networks to identify research trends and knowledge domains.<h4>Results</h4>Bibliometric evaluation revealed a progressive increase in annual publications from 2010 to 2023. Professor Ahmed Zubair (University of Birmingham, UK) emerged as the most prolific contributor with 16 publications. Chinese scholars demonstrated notable productivity: Professor Wu Wencan (Wenzhou Medical University) and Professor Yan Hua (Tianjin Medical University) each contributed 10 publications. The University of Birmingham led institutional output with 22 articles. Keyword analysis identified \"injury\" (n=102, 6.0%) as the predominant term, followed by \"optic nerve\" (n=84, 5.0%), \"management\" (n=82, 4.9%), \"retinal ganglion cell\" (n=74, 4.4%), and \"nerve decompression\" (n=46, 2.8%). These terms reflect current research foci encompassing TON pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic interventions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This bibliometric analysis systematically examined research trends in TON by evaluating annual publication outputs, authorship patterns, institutional collaborations, and conceptual keyword networks. The findings delineate evolving research priorities and interdisciplinary connections within the field, providing strategic insights for future investigations.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Prevalence of lameness associated with distal limb affection is frequently reported in sheep. Lameness diagnosis requires a systemic orthopedic examination associated with a convenient imaging modality. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most popular and accurate diagnostic modalities, providing high quality bone and soft tissue imaging. Consequently, this study aimed to combine CT and MR images with their correlative anatomical cross-sections for a comprehensive assessment of normal osseous and soft tissues in fore (n\u2009=\u20096) and hind (n\u2009=\u20096) distal limbs of lameness free sheep cadavers. These limbs were scanned using a multi-detector helical CT scanner and 1.5 tesla MRI magnet. The examined limbs were sectioned into sagittal, dorsal, and transverse slices. The acquired CT and MR images were identified and compared with the cross sections.<h4>Results</h4>The CT and MR images provided better visualization of the soft and bony structures of the distal limb in sheep. However, the CT images showed higher definition of the bony structures and a much clear demarcation of the trabecular pattern of the cancellous bone. These bony structures including the cortical, subchondral and cancellous bones. While, the MR images offered a valued delineation of the articular cartilage, which could not be evaluated using CT. The soft tissues in sheep distal limb including tendons, ligaments, interphalangeal joints, and interdigital gland were clearly visualized on CT and MR images. However, they were remarkably defined on the MR images.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CT and MRI, with the help of gross sections, admitted a comprehensive evaluation of normal soft and bone tissues constituting the distal limb in sheep. CT was appreciated to evaluate the osseous structures, while MRI was found to be the most effective for assessment the articular cartilages and soft tissues. The clinicians have to choose the appropriate modality, CT, MRI, or both, according to the clinical situations.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Lung transplantation offers a life-saving procedure to patients with end-stage lung diseases with 85-89\u00a0% one year and 60\u00a0% five-year survival rates. Lung transplants are complicated by early ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) and late chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). However, the cellular and molecular links between IRI and CLAD remain unclear.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We integrated single-cell RNA-seq results from GSE220797 and GSE224210 data sets. After quality filtering, we performed Louvain clustering and UMAP visualization. We applied Augur method to prioritize cell populations by transcriptional responsiveness to IRI and CLAD. We also performed dynamic trajectory analyses to map pseudotemporal transitions. Pathway activity was characterized by differential expression analysis and module scoring. Intercellular communication was assessed using CellChat and MEBOCOST analyses. Regulon inference was performed with pySCENIC analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, epithelial cells showed progressive metabolic suppression and activation of cuproptosis, a programmed cell death (PCD) triggered by excessive copper accumulation within cells. Club cells, found in the small airways of the lungs, exhibited developmental plasticity and predictive potential across IRI and CLAD conditions. Among myeloid populations, M1 proinflammatory (AM_M1TM) macrophages underwent macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT) and produced excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) supporting a network of proteins surrounding cells. Metabolite and cell-cell communication analyses revealed declining macrophage/epithelial metabolic crosstalk and differential signaling flux from normal through IRI to CLAD transition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The integrated single-cell atlas delineates interaction of multiple cells and their signaling pathways linking IRI to CLAD processes. These findings require further verification through studies in animal models and clinical samples.",

Higher field strength at 5\u2009T may improve image quality versus 3\u2009T, but clinical value remains unclear.<h4>Purpose</h4>To compare image quality, imaging artifacts, and PCa visualization between 3\u2009T and 5\u2009T bpMRI.<h4>Study type</h4>Prospective.<h4>Population</h4>One hundred and five patients with clinically suspected PCa, including 56 with histologically proven prostatic lesions.<h4>Field strength/sequence</h4>3\u2009T and 5\u2009T; T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) using fast spin echo and echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).<h4>Assessment</h4>Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measured at both field strengths; in the biopsy-proven cancer subset, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and lesion-boundary sharpness measured using the \"plot profile\" function. Image quality and lesion conspicuity rated on 5-point Likert scales. Prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) v2.1 agreement was compared using Cohen \u03ba. Participants were grouped by pre-scan enema (enema n\u2009=\u200961; non-enema n\u2009=\u200944) for artifact comparisons.<h4>Staistical tests</h4>Wilcoxon signed-rank test, ICC, and Cohen's \u03ba; p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant.<h4>Results</h4>5\u2009T demonstrated significantly higher SNR for T2WI (391.40 vs. 274.41) and DWI (208.82 vs. 106.40). CNR was higher at 5\u2009T for T2WI (median 10.3 vs. 8.5) and DWI (median 31.5 vs. 16.2); lesion-edge sharpness was greater at 5\u2009T (median 48.1%/mm vs. 30.9%/mm). Median scores for image quality, lesion conspicuity, and anatomy visibility were higher at 5\u2009T than at 3\u2009T (4-5 vs. 3-4). DWI artifacts were more frequent at 5\u2009T in the non-enema group (5\u2009T 20%-27% vs. 3\u2009T 11%-16%); other artifact comparisons were not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.059-0.886). PI-RADS scoring showed excellent inter-reader agreement (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.83-0.95) and good inter-field agreement (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.69-0.89).<h4>Data conclusion</h4>In bpMRI, 5\u2009T has significantly better T2WI and DWI image quality than 3\u2009T.<h4>Evidence level</h4>2.<h4>Technical efficacy</h4>Stage 3.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (FABP3) mediates the intracellular transport of fatty acids and is highly expressed in the myocardium. During myocardial infarction, FABP3 leaks from the myocardial cytoplasm into the blood; thus, detection of FABP3 using positron emission tomography (PET) is useful in identifying the site of myocardial damage. 4-(4-Fluoro-2-(1-phenyl-5-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)phenoxy)butanoic acid (LUF) is a small-molecule organic compound that specifically binds FABP3. We confirmed that fluorine-18-labeled LUF enables clear, high-quality visualization of the myocardium as well as lesions associated with myocardial injury. In this study, we performed a process validation of [<sup>18</sup>F]LUF production for clinical use and evaluated its nonclinical toxicity and radiation dosimetry estimates using mouse biodistribution data.<h4>Results</h4>The activity yield of [<sup>18</sup>F]LUF at the end of synthesis was\u2009> 8\u00a0GBq, with\u2009>\u200999% radiochemical purity,\u2009>\u2009500\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol molar activity, and\u2009<\u20091.5\u00a0\u03bcg/185\u00a0MBq total chemical content. All process validation batches complied with the product specifications. An extended single-dose intravenous toxicity study in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats indicated a no-observed adverse effect level for LUF and decay-outed [<sup>18</sup>F]LUF injection solution of\u2009\u2265\u200925\u00a0\u03bcg/kg and\u2009\u2265\u20092.5\u00a0mL/kg, respectively. These doses are\u2009> 100 times the postulated maximum dose of LUF (0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) and [<sup>18</sup>F]LUF injection solution (370\u00a0MBq). Reverse mutation tests were negative for LUF and the OH form produced after \u03b2-decay of [<sup>18</sup>F]LUF. Neither LUF nor the OH form exhibited cardiotoxicity toward cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells at\u2009> 100 times the postulated maximum dose. Biodistribution study results demonstrated predominantly hepatobiliary excretion of radioactivity. The most critical organ affected was the heart wall (68.6\u00a0\u03bcGy/MBq). The estimated effective dose was calculated as 10.2 \u03bcSv/MBq. These radiation exposure doses are equivalent to 25.4\u00a0mGy (heart wall) and 3.78\u00a0mSv for a planned maximum dose of 370\u00a0MBq.<h4>Conclusions</h4>[<sup>18</sup>F]LUF shows acceptable pharmacological safety at the dose required for adequate PET imaging. The potential risks associated with [<sup>18</sup>F]LUF injection are well within the acceptable dose limits.",

Two independent neuroradiologists assessed overall image quality (noise, artifacts, sharpness, and overall quality), wall and lumen visualization along the intracranial vessels using a 4-point Likert scale. A cumulative-logit mixed-effects model (CLMM) of segment ratings was used for intersequence comparison. Segments were also pooled into proximal vs distal vessels and quality compared using exact paired sign test. Overall image quality metrics were compared using paired Wilcoxon tests and Bland-Altman plots. Inter-reader agreement was summarized using percent agreement.<h4>Results</h4>On segment-level analysis, T1-SPACE<sub>DL</sub> yielded markedly higher ratings than T1-SPACE<sub>SOC</sub> [wall: OR = 22.79 (95% CI 15.83- 32.82), lumen: OR = 97.0 (95% CI 66.8-141.0); both FDR-adjusted p<0.001]. Effects remained large when segments were pooled into proximal and distal segments [For wall, proximal segment OR = 297.0 (95% CI 40-\u221e) and distal segment OR = 71.0 (28-404); for lumen, proximal OR = 82.0 (36-339) and distal OR = 225.0 (60-13350); all FDR-adjusted p<0.001]. Reader-wise Wilcoxon tests showed higher overall image quality scores across noise, artifacts, sharpness, and overall quality for T1-SPACE<sub>DL</sub> ([all p < 0.001]). Inter-reader agreement was uniformly high with T1-SPACE<sub>DL</sub> when compared to T1-SPACE<sub>SOC</sub>. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a positive bias favoring T1-SPACE<sub>DL</sub>. Acquisition time was reduced from 7:30 minutes with T1-SPACE<sub>SOC</sub> to 6:00 minutes (20% reduction) with T1-SPACE<sub>DL</sub>.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Contrast-enhanced T1-SPACE<sub>DL</sub> at 7T may have potential clinical utility for IC-VWI, given the shorter acquisition, significantly improved image quality and reduced image artifacts.<h4>Abbreviations</h4>DLBIR\uff1ddeep learning-based image reconstruction; SNR\uff1dsignal-to-noise ratio; CNR\uff1dcontrast-to-noise ratio; VWI\uff1dVessel Wall Imaging; DL\uff1d deep-learning; SOC\uff1d standard-of-care.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background and purpose</h4>CT imaging of sub-millimeter middle ear prostheses-vital for post-surgery treatment-requires highspatial-resolution. This study evaluated the impact of spatial resolution for the visualization of prostheses using photon-countingdetector (PCD) CT, energy-integrating-detector (EID) CT, and EID-CT with attenuating comb filters.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Twenty-one middle ear prostheses of different makes were placed within a head phantom and scanned on a PCD-CT (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens), two dual-source CTs with comb filters (Force and Flash, Siemens), and a dual-layer CT without comb filter (7500, Philips). Scanning and reconstruction followed clinical temporal bone protocols for each scanner, with a matched 120kV and 80mm field-of-view; sharp kernels/algorithms of Qr89, Ur77, Ur77, and YD; and minimal allowable slice thickness of 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.67mm, respectively. Qualitative assessments were performed, including visual inspection, volume rendering, a blind reader study, and quantitative assessments using line profiles, and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). One prosthesis was implanted in human cadaver head and scanned on a PCD-CT (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens), a 3rd generation dual-source (Force, Siemens), and a dual-layer CT (7500, Philips) following the same phantom study protocols. Image quality was compared among the scanners.<h4>Results</h4>PCD-CT provided images with the highest spatial resolution, allowing clinically relevant assessment of prosthesis position. EID-CT scanners with comb filters provided good results, with noticeable loss of detail, while EID-CT without a comb filter showed substantial resolution loss. These findings were consistent across readers (Kendall's W=0.89, p-value<0.001) and validated by the line profiles and FWHM measurements. PCD-CT showed a 49.5% improvement over EID-CT without comb filter. Among scanners with ultra-high-resolution (UHR) capabilities, PCD-CT had lower radiation dose (CTDI<sub>vol</sub>: 31.5 vs 46.7 and 51.4 mGy) and lower noise (81.3 vs 93.0 and 274.8 HU) compared to two EID-CTs with comb filters. In the cadaver study, PCD-CT provided higher resolution and lower noise than both EID-CT scanners with and without comb filters (67.6 vs 118.6 and 50.1 HU).<h4>Conclusions</h4>PCD-CT provided dose-efficient, accurate evaluation of ossicular prostheses, without the degradation of sub-millimeter structures, while maintaining lower dose and noise.<h4>Abbreviations</h4>PCD\uff1d Photon-counting-detector; EID\uff1d Energy-integrating-detector; UHR\uff1d Ultra-high-resolution; FWHM\uff1d Full-width at half-maximum; FOV\uff1d Field-of-view; VRT\uff1d Volume rendering technique; CTDIvol\uff1d Volume CT dose index; PROP\uff1d Partial ossicular replacement prosthesis; TROP\uff1d Total ossicular replacement prosthesis.",
