      "abstractText": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a prevalent malignancy in countries along Mekong basin, closely linked to chronic infections caused by Opisthorchis viverrini (OV). Early detection of OV-infected individuals holds significant promise for screening at-risk populations in endemic regions. Recent advancements in immunochromatographic methods have led to the development of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) based on urinary antigens. However, the current interpretation relies on visual assessment of T-band color intensity, which can be subjective and prone to variability. Furthermore, aggregating data at the regional/country level demands data digitization, a time and resource intense task that introduces further errors. To address this limitation, we introduce the OV-RDT platform, a cloud-based system incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) designed to standardize the reading and interpretation of OV-RDT results while facilitating mass screening campaigns for opisthorchiasis. This cross-platform solution, available on Android and iOS devices, consists of three key components: a mobile application, an intelligent dashboard, and a cloud server cluster. The server cluster has two main components the data processing server and the AI server. The AI server operates two AI-based models systematically developed and validated for image quality assessment and T-band grading of OV-RDT test kit images. The data processing server periodically retrieves and processes data from the cloud database, enabling comprehensive daily visualization through the intelligent dashboard. Validation through extensive field testing was conducted specifically in the northeastern region of Thailand, where opisthorchiasis prevalence is among the highest globally, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness by processing over 100,000 samples. While our platform shows excellent performance in this endemic region, external validation in other geographical areas would be necessary to establish broader generalizability. The EfficientNet-B5-based deep learning model used in the platform exhibited impressive performance in both image quality assessment (98% accuracy) and infection grading classification (95% accuracy in detecting OV infection status). The platform's user-friendly interface has achieved high satisfaction rates (4.41/5.00) among healthcare workers, while its intelligent dashboard offers real-time analytics and geospatial visualization capabilities. This integrated approach marks a significant advancement in mass screening for opisthorchiasis, potentially enhancing early detection rates and supporting more effective public health interventions in Southeast Asia and the Mekong Basin countries. This study addresses the critical need for mass screening in northeastern Thailand, where liver fluke infection rates are particularly severe; however, the platform's performance in other regions requires future validation studies.",

      "abstractText": "Emergency department (ED) \"boarding\" for behavioral health occurs when patients remain in emergency rooms overnight due to a lack of available psychiatric beds. However, quantification of the problem and demographic characterization of affected populations have been limited and manual. When a patient stays in the ED awaiting either an inpatient psychiatric bed or community care, this is known as a behavioral health hold (BHH). Understanding of BHH requires statewide, 'real-time' data collection that does not widely exist. Collaborators leveraged an existing syndromic surveillance system to compile ED data from across North Carolina into an executive BHH dashboard by developing a custom data extract, implementing a BHH case definition, and curating the data in a secure environment. Data come from 131 hospitals submitting ED visit data to NC DETECT, and the resulting extract includes patients with ED encounters lasting at least 24\u00a0hours for a behavioral health reason from November 2022 to November 2024. The team implemented and evaluated multiple case definitions of BHH based on ICD-10 codes or keywords listed within the free-text encounter chief complaint. One case definition and four metrics were selected for use within a dashboard based on subject matter expert feedback. US Census Bureau data were used to create population denominators and estimate population rates, which are presented in an equity context. This dashboard enabled data-driven funding and policy decisions for additional crisis stabilization resources, including Facility Based Crisis (FBC) facilities, Behavioral Health Urgent Care (BHUC) facilities, and Mobile Response and Stabilization Services. A cross-departmental approach provided the necessary expertise for state departments of health to capitalize on an existing syndromic surveillance system to address a behavioral health policy need. This novel approach, encapsulated in a dashboard, places intelligence about the burden of BHH directly in the hands of policy makers.",

We conducted a simulation-based randomized trial to evaluate whether a GenAI-enhanced CDSS, \"GutGPT,\" improves adoption compared to an AI dashboard in acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding management. Clinical trainees were randomized to either GutGPT or a comparator dashboard across three cases. The primary outcome was Behavioral Intention, from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Secondary measures included additional constructs and decision accuracy. A total of 106 participants participated (52 GutGPT, 54 comparator). GutGPT users reported higher Effort Expectancy. Behavioral Intention had no significant difference. Qualitative analysis highlighted trust and workflow concerns. These findings suggest that usability alone is insufficient to drive adoption. As this study was conducted in a simulation without real-world integration or patient outcomes, further studies are needed.

      "abstractText": "The Equity Mapping Tool (EMT), a set of integrated tools providing rapid up-to-date COVID-19 data was previously developed for local health departments and health care systems in Franklin County, Ohio, to guide decisions about mobile vaccination. We aimed to engage, extend, and enhance the EMT to 12 Pathway Community HUBs (HUBs) in Ohio, connecting at-risk individuals to health and social services across 61 counties. This was an innovation demonstration project in HUBs to increase community resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the project goals was to provide Community Health Workers (CHWs) working with HUBs with local data for local decisions to advance the health of all Ohioans by engaging, extending, and enhancing the EMT. We used a continuous improvement process called the Engagement, Analytics, Translation (EAT) Framework to engage, extend, and enhance the EMT for HUBs. Engagement activities consisted of focus groups with HUB staff and consultation with CHW Advisory Council, facilitated the co-creation of EMT tools for HUBs and their subsequent enhancement. These activities guided analytics tasks by identifying data requirements, curation, and guiding the development of reports and dashboard for the extended EMT. In translation phase, EMT products were disseminated to HUBs, whose feedback during subsequent engagement activities guided further analytical workflows to enhance EMT. Engagement activities resulted in the identification of shared goals. Public health data needs of HUBs were centered around their populations served, health disparities of focus, and services provided. The capacity to access the EMT interactive dashboard and PDF reports was extended to all 12 HUBs. The collaboration between academic, public health, and community health partners was critical to extending and enhancing the EMT to HUBs. Cycles of EAT helped to be responsive to HUBs' need for data and build their capacity for improving community resiliency.",

      "abstractText": "The validity of inferences from patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) scores can be confounded by differential item functioning (DIF). DIF occurs when there is heterogeneity in how patients respond to and interpret questions about their health, despite having the same underlying health status. Ignoring the effects of DIF could lead to inaccurate interpretations and misinformed clinical decisions resulting in compromised healthcare delivery. Tree-based item response theory (IRT) models are recommended as an alternative class of methods for analyzing PROMs because they offer a robust approach for identifying DIF when covariates associated with DIF are unknown a priori. This paper introduces a web application developed using R Shiny, which enables users to implement tree-based IRT models for DIF assessment in potentially heterogeneous populations. The app provides flexible model specifications, visualization tools, and customizable settings to accommodate various data types and research needs. A practical tutorial is included, guiding users through the application interface, data preparation, model selection, and interpretation of results. The web application (https://ucalgary-pcma-lab.shinyapps.io/tree_based_dif_analysis/) offers interactive data upload in .CSV and .XLSX data formats. Recommendations are provided for selecting model parameters within the app based on the results of previous simulation studies. The web app tests for DIF on dichotomous- and polytomous-scored items. The coefficients, item parameters, and plots provide insights into potential sources of DIF. This web application provides a user-friendly, interactive, innovative, easily accessible, and valuable tool for clinicians, applied health researchers, and analysts seeking to understand sample heterogeneity due to DIF in PROM data.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Despite the proven efficacy of antipsychotics in relapse prevention in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, every third patient experiences a relapse within less than one year. Relapses can worsen psychosocial and treatment related outcomes and lead to substantial economic costs, primarily due to frequent and prolonged hospitalizations. The aim of this project is to evaluate a smartphone- and web-based digital solution for detecting early warning signs of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder to reduce relapses and subsequent hospitalizations.<h4>Methods</h4>This randomized controlled trial compares the add-on use of a smartphone-based app for monitoring relapse warning signs in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders (ICD-10 F20/F25) used within the routine psychiatric outpatient treatment against treatment as usual (TAU) without any further study-related intervention. Patients in the intervention group use the app for one year, fill in the weekly ten-item Early Warning Signs Questionnaire (EWSQ-10P) and obtain in-app feedback. Clinicians can access the symptom trajectory via a browser-accessible dashboard. If a threshold is exceeded in the inbuilt automatic algorithm, an alert is sent to both, the clinician and patient, enabling timely contact and, as part of a shared decision-making process, an optional adjustment of treatment decision. A total of 110 outpatients are recruited across eight study sites.<h4>Discussion</h4>Continuous monitoring of early warning signs is expected to lead to behavioral changes and to decrease the necessity and duration of psychiatric hospital stays, thereby lowering healthcare costs. Additionally, the intervention could reduce symptom severity, alleviate medication adherence, shared decision-making, patient activation or quality of life. Qualitative data is collected to better understand patient needs and preferences regarding app usage and relapses. Insights gained from this study can be integrated into routine psychiatric care, improving the long-term treatment of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.<h4>Trial registration</h4>German Clinical Trials Register (ID: DRKS00034991; registration date: 30.08.2024).",

This study aims to map the research landscape via bibliometric analysis, identifying future trends and key areas of interest. We collected articles and reviews on ctDNA and colorectal cancer from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus, conducting bibliometric analysis and visualization using VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and R packages. A total of 1,730 publications were included in the bibliometric analysis. Of these, 325 were unique to WOS and 639 were unique to SCOPUS. The United States and China led in publication volume with 555 and 306 papers, respectively, while the United States and Italy had the highest citation counts, with 39,142 and 21,417 citations, respectively. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center was the most prolific institution. The journals Cancers and Frontiers in Oncology were the most frequently published. Bardelli A stood out as the most prolific and cited author. Cluster analysis revealed trending topics such as \"minimal residual disease,\" \"adjuvant chemotherapy,\" and \"recurrence.\" This bibliometric analysis highlights significant advancements and emerging trends in the clinical application of ctDNA for colorectal cancer. The identified hotspots deserve further attention from researchers in this field.",

Persistent non-visualization of the fetal gallbladder (NVFGB) was defined as non-visualization at least twice using an ultrasound scan. Antenatal ultrasound findings were obtained from the medical records, and the clinical, radiological, and surgical findings of the babies were reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 113 referred patients were evaluated. Most enlarged and small GBs were identified as normal or GB stones, sludge, septate GB, or choledochal cysts (CDC). NVFGB was identified postnatally in 77.5% of cases. Persistent NVFGB was identified postnatally as biliary atresia (3/14; 21.4%), hepatic parenchymal disease with cholestasis (2/14; 14.2%), or isolated GB agenesis (42.8%, 6/14). The majority of cysts in the fetal liver cases with visualization of the fetal GB were identified as CDC. Half of the patients (2/4) with CDC who underwent NVFGB were confirmed to have biliary atresia.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Except for persistent NVFGB, most abnormal ultrasound findings in fetal GB were associated with good postnatal outcomes. Cysts in the fetal liver with visualization of the fetal GB did not result in serious adverse outcomes. NVFGB, especially persistent NVFGB with or without cysts in the fetal liver, should be followed up closely prenatally and postnatally.",

Words alone often aren't enough to communicate what's happening with a complex system, which is where and how visualizations can play an important role. A systems map is one such visualization tool that can be useful as it graphically shows the different components that make up a complex system and their relationships with one another. While systems mapping is not new as a concept or tool and in fact is used in other fields, its potential for health and public health communications still remains largely untapped. There is a series of sequential steps to follow to develop a systems map for health communications that allows for various perspectives to be included and minimizes bias, setting up a process to create a fuller representation of the system. Future directions of systems mapping for public health communications should leverage emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual and extended reality (VR/XR) to further advance the usefulness systems mapping can have to improve our understanding of complex systems in public health and better communicate them to the public.",

By employing Coded Excitation and Tissue-Blood Equalization (TBE) technologies, B-Flow enhances the detection of low-velocity and microvascular blood flow while minimizing aliasing artifacts and angle dependency. This innovative technique proves especially useful in abdominal ultrasound, enabling the accurate assessment of vascularization in organs such as the liver, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and bowel. B-Flow's ability to depict fine vascular details is particularly beneficial in evaluating focal lesions, vascular malformations, portal hypertension, and transplant perfusion. Furthermore, the technique's application extends to both parenchymal and vascular pathologies, demonstrating significant advantages over traditional Doppler methods in terms of spatial resolution and real-time flow visualization. This pictorial essay aims to describe the technological basis of the B-Flow technique, highlighting its advantages and disadvantages, as well as the main clinical applications in abdominal diagnostics.",

VBHC defines value as patient-relevant outcomes relative to costs, but in practice, costs are often overlooked. Therefore, this study aimed to explore functional, operational, and technical requirements for the implementation of costs in VBHC dashboards.<h4>Methods</h4>A qualitative study was performed at the organ transplant center of Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Qualitative data were collected using 15 semi-structured interviews, with stakeholders from four different categories: (1) health care providers, (2) management, (3) finance and IT, and (4) patients. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and deductive coding based on requirements analysis.<h4>Results</h4>This study identified three functional requirements for the implementation of costs in VBHC dashboards. All stakeholder groups aimed to (1) identify costs and resources and (2) evaluate the value of care, whereas management additionally saw a role in (3) monitoring the financial viability of a care pathway. The required cost indicators could be categorized into four categories: cost of care activities, resources used to deliver care, income (e.g., reimbursements), and patient costs (e.g., out-of-pocket). In terms of operational requirements, costs should be reviewed monthly to quarterly in a recurring meeting, collectively by the care team and a financial expert. Technical requirements were a costing model that accurately captures all costs in care delivery, is validated, and provides up-to-date estimates. In addition, the dashboard interface should be embedded in existing IT systems to increase usability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study supports the implementation of costs in VBHC dashboards through actionable requirements. By understanding key functional, operational, and technical requirements from different stakeholder perspectives, hospital cost data can be effectively integrated to improve the value of care delivery and monitor the financial viability of care pathways. Future research should focus on the role of patient-relevant costs in the data-driven improvement of VBHC delivery.",

This case highlights the integration of AR technology during a challenging transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) using a self-expanding system in a pediatric patient. A 12-year-old male with a history of congenital pulmonary valve stenosis presented with progressive right ventricular dilation and exercise intolerance. Dynamic CTA was processed via ARTICOR\u00ae software (Artiness, Milano, Italy) and visualized through the Microsoft HoloLens for intraprocedural support. During initial balloon sizing, unexpected waist formation raised concern for wire malposition. AR visualization enabled identification of native leaflet avulsions/perforations previously unrecognized on conventional imaging. With this insight, successful wire repositioning and repeat balloon sizing were achieved, allowing for the accurate valve deployment. This case demonstrates the feasibility and clinical utility of AR-guided procedural support in complex TPVR. Real-time 3D visualization holds significant promise for improving safety and precision in congenital heart interventions.",

In this study, a novel fluorescent probe, ZNP, was designed and synthesized for tracking hydrazine in soils and river water. It was used for in situ monitoring of hydrazine generation in living cells. The optical performance guaranteed the high selectivity and reliable anti-interference. The most significant merit was a practical dynamic range for intuitive visualization. Additionally, the develop probe predominantly accumulated in lysosomes. Notably, ZNP integrated the fluorescent and visual signals, which enabled the naked-eye observation. This work acted as a significant step towards the practical tools for environmental toxicology applications.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Extraction of impacted mesiodens presents surgical challenges due to the proximity to developing permanent incisors. This study evaluated how adding 3D-printed visualization models to cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) surgical planning impacts trainees' efficiency and precision in impacted mesiodens extraction.<h4>Methods</h4>Ten pediatric dental residents, all without prior experience in mesiodens extraction, were randomized into two groups. Group I received CBCT imaging with access to a transparent 3D-printed visualization model. Group II received CBCT imaging alone. Each participant performed a simulated mesiodens extraction using anatomically accurate 3D-printed surgical models. Primary outcome measures included surgical time and extent of bone removal, quantified by comparing presurgical and postsurgical CT scans of the models. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test with p < 0.05 considered significant. Effect sizes were calculated to assess clinical relevance.<h4>Results</h4>Group I demonstrated a shorter mean surgical time (508.8 \u00b1 165.91 s) compared to Group II (720.8 \u00b1 174.78 s), though the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The observed effect size (r = 0.56) indicates a large effect and a potential efficiency improvement. Bone removal was significantly reduced in Group I compared to Group II for both surface area and volume (p < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Access to 3D-printed visualization models with CBCT imaging significantly minimized unnecessary bone removal and enhanced surgical precision, supporting their use as an effective adjunct in simulation-based surgical training. Although the sample size was small (n = 10), which limits statistical power and generalizability, large effect sizes suggest educational value. Further studies with larger cohorts will be useful to confirm and extend these findings.",

We included 1,839 observations from 878 patients with metastatic breast cancer from the PRO B study. We compared direct mapping algorithms, including adjusted limited dependent variable mixture models (ALDVMM), Tobit regression, ordinal least squares regression, and adjusted beta regression, while indirect mapping employed a generalized ordered logit model. Visualization was used to assess model performance across the entire distribution, while quantitative evaluation was performed using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean prediction bias. Among the direct algorithms, adjusted beta regression demonstrated the best performance. It had the lowest MAE of 0.07-0.08 and RMSE of 0.11-0.13, a mean prediction bias of -0.004, close to zero. The indirect mapping model also performed well, with a mean prediction bias of 0.04 and MAE of 0.07, showing performance comparable to the preferred direct mapping algorithm for both the EORTC CAT Core and the QLQ-C30. This study developed and validated robust direct and indirect algorithms for estimating the EQ-5D-5L utility index from the EORTC CAT Core and the QLQ-C30 based on the German tariff. In particular, using this indirect mapping algorithm, the EORTC CAT Core and QLQ-C30 can be translated into quality-adjusted life-years, facilitating health economic evaluations across different country tariffs.

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Bloodstream infections (BSIs) pose a significant health threat, requiring effective diagnostic processes to ensure appropriate treatment. Monitoring the quality of blood cultures (BCs) process (the cornerstone of BSIs etiological diagnosis) is critical. This study aimed to describe an automated tool, BD DREAM\u2122 (Digital Remote Extraction Analysis & Monitoring), designed for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) in the BCs process.<h4>Methods</h4>A multicenter study was conducted across six Italian hospitals, analyzing 234,978 BC bottles, associated with 55,819 episodes. The system monitored KPIs related to mean blood volume per bottle, rates of solitary episodes, rate of BCs from central venous catheter (CVC) unpaired with concomitant BCs from peripheral vein, and contamination rates.<h4>Results</h4>The findings highlighted significant variability in BC practices among centers and hospital services, with mean blood volume per bottle below recommended standards (6.45 mL vs.\u2009\u2265\u20098.0 mL), with 21.8% (range 3.2-62.9%) of episodes classified as solitary. The rate of BCs from CVC unpaired with concomitant BCs from peripheral vein was 14.9% (range 10.2-39.0%). Overall, contamination rates ranged from 4.2 to 4.7%, depending on the criteria adopted for definition. The setting with the more critical values was medical area.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The tool was useful for immediate visualization and identification of hospital services with critical performance. These results suggest that integrating BC digital monitoring tools into clinical microbiology workflows is possible. Further studies will be needed to demonstrate that the implementation of BD DREAM\u2122 can lead to enhancement of diagnostic accuracy, optimization of resources allocation, and improvement of patient outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have contributed to improved predictive modeling in health care, particularly in oncology. Traditional methods often rely on structured tabular data, but these approaches can struggle to capture complex interactions among clinical variables. Image generator for health tabular data (IGHT) transform tabular electronic medical record (EMR) data into structured 2D image matrices, enabling the use of powerful computer vision-based deep learning models. This approach offers a novel baseline for survival prediction in colorectal cancer by leveraging spatial encoding of clinical features, potentially enhancing prognostic accuracy and interpretability.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning model using EMR data to predict 5-year overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer and to examine the clinical interpretability of model predictions using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques.<h4>Methods</h4>Anonymized EMR data of 3321 patients at the Gil Medical Center were analyzed. The dataset included demographic details, tumor characteristics, laboratory values, treatment modalities, and follow-up outcomes. Clinical variables were converted into 2D image matrices using the IGHT. Patients were stratified into colon and rectal cancer groups to account for biological and prognostic differences. Three models were developed and compared: a conventional artificial neural network (ANN), a basic convolutional neural network (CNN), and a transfer learning-based Visual Geometry Group (VGG)16 model. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-scores. To interpret model decisions, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to visualize regions of the input images that contributed most to predictions, enabling identification of key prognostic features.<h4>Results</h4>Among the tested models, VGG16 exhibited superior predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of 78.44% for colon cancer and 74.83% for rectal cancer. It showed notably high specificity (89.55% for colon cancer and 87.9% for rectal cancer), indicating strong reliability in correctly identifying patients likely to survive beyond 5 years. Compared to ANN and CNN models, VGG16 achieved a better balance between sensitivity and specificity, demonstrating robustness in the presence of moderate class imbalance within the dataset. Grad-CAM visualization highlighted clinically relevant features (eg, age, gender, smoking history, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification (ASA) grade, liver disease, pulmonary disease, and initial carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] levels). Conversely, the CNN model yielded lower overall accuracy and low specificity, which limits its immediate applicability in clinical settings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed IGHT-based deep learning model, particularly leveraging the VGG16 architecture, demonstrates promising accuracy and interpretability in predicting 5-year overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Its capability to effectively stratify patients into risk categories with balanced sensitivity and specificity underscores its potential utility as a clinical decision support system (CDSS) tool. Future studies incorporating external validation with multicenter cohorts and prospective designs are necessary to establish generalizability and clinical integration feasibility.",

Interactive annotation starts with an AI-generated delineation, allowing radiologists to refine it with feedback, potentially improving precision and reliability. These techniques have been explored in two-dimensional desktop environments, but are not validated by radiologists or integrated with immersive visualization technologies. We used a Virtual Reality (VR) system to determine whether (1) the annotation quality improves when radiologists can edit the AI annotation and (2) whether the extra work done by editing is worthwhile.<h4>Methods</h4>We evaluated the clinical feasibility of an interactive VR approach to annotate mandibular and mental foramina on segmented 3D mandibular models. Three experienced dentomaxillofacial radiologists reviewed AI-generated annotations and, when needed, refined them at the voxel level in 3D space through click-based interactions until clinical standards were met.<h4>Results</h4>Our results indicate that integrating expert feedback within an immersive VR environment enhances annotation accuracy, improves clinical usability, and offers valuable insights for developing medical image analysis systems incorporating radiologist input.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study is the first to compare the quality of original and interactive AI annotation and to use radiologists' opinions as the measure.

      "abstractText": "The uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema (UGH) syndrome, initially described in 1978, presents as an iatrogenic complication associated with contact between intraocular implant and ocular tissue. This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including intraocular inflammation, elevated intraocular pressure, and recurrent hemorrhage. Advances in cataract surgery techniques reduced the incidence of early intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation while inversely increased rates of delayed dislocation. The primary etiology of UGH syndrome is IOL subluxation. Weakness of the ciliary zonules or unstable IOL fixation techniques may predispose the eye to iris-lens contact. Other contributing factors include Soemmering's ring formation, abnormal iris and ciliary body anatomy, positional changes, and improper positioning of glaucoma implants. Clinical examination and imaging modalities such as ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography supports diagnosis of UGH. Treatment options range from observation and medical therapies to invasive procedures such as laser therapy, IOL repositioning, or replacement. Endoscopy provides direct visualization for identifying causes intraoperatively, aiding in tailored surgical approaches towards minimal intervention. In conclusion, UGH syndrome poses a complex clinical challenge, emphasizing the importance of understanding its etiology, accurate diagnosis, and personalized management strategies to mitigate its impact on visual function and ensure favorable outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Aim</h4>Timely intervention of interstitial lung disease (ILD) was promising for attenuating the lung function decline and improving clinical outcomes. The prone position HRCT is essential for early diagnosis of ILD, but limited by its high radiation exposure. This study was aimed to explore whether deep learning reconstruction (DLR) could keep the image quality and reduce the radiation dose compared with hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) in prone position scanning for patients of early-stage ILD.<h4>Methods</h4>This study prospectively enrolled 21 patients with early-stage ILD. All patients underwent high-resolution CT (HRCT) and low-dose CT (LDCT) scans. HRCT images were reconstructed with HIR using standard settings, and LDCT images were reconstructed with DLR (lung/bone kernel) in a mild, standard, or strong setting. Overall image quality, image noise, streak artifacts, and visualization of normal and abnormal ILD features were analysed.<h4>Results</h4>The effective dose of LDCT was 1.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09 mSv, 63.7% less than the HRCT dose. The objective noise of the LDCT DLR images was 35.9-112.6% that of the HRCT HIR images. The LDCT DLR was comparable to the HRCT HIR in terms of overall image quality. LDCT DLR (bone, strong) visualization of bronchiectasis and/or bronchiolectasis was significantly weaker than that of HRCT HIR (p\u2009=\u20090.046). The LDCT DLR (all settings) did not significantly differ from the HRCT HIR in the evaluation of other abnormal features, including ground glass opacities (GGOs), architectural distortion, reticulation and honeycombing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>With 63.7% reduction of radiation dose, the overall image quality of LDCT DLR was comparable to HRCT HIR in prone scanning for early ILD patients. This study supported that DLR was promising for maintaining image quality under a lower radiation dose in prone scanning, and it offered valuable insights for the selection of images reconstruction algorithms for the diagnosis and follow-up of early ILD.",

Mobile health (mHealth) platforms may be a useful tool for increasing long-term engagement in MAT programs, but evaluation studies of such platforms are limited.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to determine whether the use of the Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) software platform increased MAT engagement for patients with opioid use disorder.<h4>Methods</h4>The Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Study was a quasi-experimental study conducted at a primary care clinic in the United States between January 2021 and February 2022. OARS is a software platform and mobile app (Q2i, LLC) that includes a dashboard of real-time appointment attendance, urine toxicology (UTOX) results, and educational content as well as messaging and journaling features. All patients who were invited to use OARS and had available data across the study were included in the analysis. The primary outcomes were engagement in treatment, defined as no more than a 35-day gap in appointment attendance, and UTOX. Changes in treatment engagement between the treatment as usual (TAU) period and OARS intervention period were assessed using the effect size (Cohen g) and McNemar chi-square test of discordant pairs.<h4>Results</h4>Among 205 patients invited to use OARS, 123 had available data and were thus included in the analysis. The median age was 37 (IQR 31-42.5 ) years, 61% (75/123) identified as men, and 95.1% (117/123) identified as non-Hispanic White. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics for patients who used OARS on more than 1 day compared to patients who used OARS on 0 or 1 day, or patients who did versus did not have available data. Among all patients, 20% (25/123) were engaged in appointment attendance during TAU only compared to 27% (33/123) during OARS only (g=0.07; P=.36), and 13% (16/123) were engaged in UTOX during TAU only and 33% (41/123) during OARS only (g=0.21; P\u2264.01). Among a subsample of 52 patients who used OARS on more than 1 day, 17% (9/52) were engaged in appointment attendance during TAU only compared to 23% (12/52) during OARS only (g=0.07, P=.67), and 13% (7/52) were engaged in UTOX during TAU only and 35% (18/52) during OARS only (g=0.22, P=.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Introduction of OARS in a primary care setting may be associated with a moderate change in MAT engagement as measured by UTOX, but not appointment attendance. While barriers to implementation and adoption, including difficulty fully integrating OARS with the clinic's electronic health record, may have attenuated the potential effect of the intervention, this study provides evidence that mHealth interventions, such as OARS, are a promising addition to the MAT treatment landscape.",

      "abstractText": "Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is a serious perinatal complication. Accurate preoperative identification of patients at high risk for adverse clinical outcomes is essential for developing personalized treatment strategies. This study aimed to develop and validate a high-performance, interpretable machine learning model that integrates MRI morphological indicators and clinical features to predict adverse outcomes in PAS, and to build an online prediction tool to enhance its clinical applicability. This retrospective study included 125 clinically confirmed PAS patients from two centers, categorized into high-risk (intraoperative blood loss over 1500\u00a0mL or requiring hysterectomy) and low-risk groups. Data from Center 1 were used for model development, and data from Center 2 served as the external validation set. Five MRI morphological indicators and six clinical features were extracted as model inputs. Three machine learning classifiers-AdaBoost, TabPFN, and CatBoost-were trained and evaluated on both internal testing and external validation cohorts. SHAP analysis was used to interpret model decision-making, and the optimal model was deployed via a Streamlit-based web platform. The CatBoost model achieved the best performance, with AUROCs of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.73-0.99) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.70-0.97) in the internal testing and external validation sets, respectively. Calibration curves indicated strong agreement between predicted and actual risks. SHAP analysis revealed that \"Cervical\u00a0canal\u00a0length\" and \"Gestational\u00a0age\" contributed negatively to high-risk predictions, while \"Prior\u00a0C-sections\u00a0number\", \"Placental\u00a0abnormal\u00a0vasculature\u00a0area\", and Parturition were positively associated. The final online tool allows real-time risk prediction and visualization of individualized force plots and is freely accessible to clinicians and patients. This study successfully developed an interpretable and practical machine learning model for predicting adverse clinical outcomes in PAS. The accompanying online tool may support clinical decision-making and improve individualized management for PAS patients.",

      "abstractText": "Traumatic osteomyelitis (TO) treatment remains challenging due to biofilm formation and poor antibiotic penetration. We developed poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres co-loaded with moxifloxacin/rifampicin (M/R-P) to address these limitations. Key findings: In vitro: The microspheres showed (1) no cytotoxicity (CCK-8 assay; live/dead staining; cytoskeletal staining; SEM visualization), and (2) no inhibition of osteogenic potential (ALP activity).In vivo: M/R-P microspheres significantly reduced MRSA burden ( 8\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b3 CFU/g) compared to debridement-only controls (3143\u2009\u00b1\u2009727\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b3 CFU/g; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and near-complete infection resolution (histopathology). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the M/R-P microspheres possess excellent safety profiles, favorable cytocompatibility, and remarkable antibacterial efficacy. The findings confirm the feasibility of our innovative approach using PLGA as a drug delivery carrier for localized antibiotic therapy in chronic osteomyelitis treatment, achieved through technological optimization for combined antibiotic administration. This provides a novel strategic direction for ultimately overcoming the clinical challenge of traumatic osteomyelitis.",

      "abstractText": "To develop a risk stratification framework for various pseudopodia patterns in acne detected by Gamma-calibrated 33 MHz ultrasound and to investigate the predictive value of macro-pseudopodia for poor prognosis. In this prospective study, the pseudopodia of acne detected by Gamma-calibrated 33 MHz high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) were graded. Based on the pseudopodium morphology, 110 acne from 32 moderate-to-severe patients were stratified into two groups: a low-risk and a high-risk level group. Univariate analyses were employed to determine features associated with high-risk acne. A one-month clinical follow-up was conducted in a subgroup of 19 moderate patients (61 lesions) treated with topical therapy. A 70% reduction in acne area was defined as effective treatment response. Univariate analyses were employed to determine features associated with poor prognosis. The Gamma-calibrated 33 MHz ultrasound provided remarkably high resolution and contrast, allowing for the visualization of various pseudopodia patterns in acne, including short strip, long strip, vase shape, nodular convex, and fistula. These types were further stratified into low- and high-risk levels based on HFUS and clinical characteristics. The maximum diameter, perimeter, area, and location of acne were closely related to the occurrence of high-risk type (p < 0.001). One-month clinical follow-up in moderate acne patients confirmed a significant association between high-risk pseudopodia and poor prognosis (p = 0.006). The Gamma-calibrated 33 MHz ultrasound imaging strategy was an accurate mode in risk stratification for various pseudopodia patterns. Macro-pseudopodia were associated with poor prognosis, underscoring their indispensable role in the strategic management of acne disease.",

      "abstractText": "This case report demonstrates two contrasting clinical cases of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. In the first case, a 68-year-old patient with a body mass index (BMI) of 38 underwent SLN mapping using indocyanine green (ICG) alone. Although fluorescence-guided dissection revealed nodes appearing \"ICG-positive,\" histopathological evaluation confirmed the absence of lymphatic tissue in the removed specimens-indicating the presence of so-called \"empty nodes.\" This highlights the limitations of relying solely on optical fluorescence, especially in patients with high BMI or altered lymphatic architecture. In contrast, the second case, involving a 65-year-old patient with a BMI of 40, demonstrates the effectiveness of using a combined technique with ICG and technetium-99m (Tc99m). The synergy between real-time fluorescence visualization and gamma probe detection enabled precise SLN identification and confirmed the presence of true lymphatic tissue histologically. This dual case report underscores the limitations of ICG-only SLN mapping and and illustrates the potential added value of technetium-99m in improving the accuracy of lymphatic staging, warranting further validation.",

      "abstractText": "Compliance rates for mobile health (mHealth) studies that involve intensive study designs are highly variable. Both person- and study-specific factors likely contribute to this variability. We were interested in understanding the impact that care partner characteristics and demographics have on study engagement, given that engagement is critical to the success of mHealth interventions. The primary objective of this report was to analyze the overall and component-specific completion and compliance rates for an intensive 6-month mHealth intervention (CareQOL app) designed to promote self-awareness and self-care among care partners of individuals with traumatic brain injury. This randomized controlled trial was designed to test the CareQOL app, an mHealth app designed to promote care partner self-awareness (through self-monitoring) and self-care (through personalized self-care push notifications). The study design consisted of a baseline assessment, a 6-month home-monitoring period that included 3 daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questions, monthly patient-reported outcome (PRO) surveys, continuous activity and sleep monitoring using a Fitbit, and 2 follow-up PRO surveys at 3 and 6 months posthome monitoring. Three participants withdrew prior to the initiation of the home-monitoring period, resulting in a final analytical sample size of 254. All participants had access to a self-monitoring dashboard (CareQOL app) that included graphical displays of the daily survey scores, as well as daily steps and sleep data from the Fitbit. Overall compliance for the different aspects of the study was high. On average, the full-sample daily EMA PRO completion rate was 84% (SD 19%), Fitbit-based step count compliance was 90% (SD 21%), and Fitbit-based sleep duration compliance was 75% (SD 32%); there was no difference between the study arms for daily EMA PROs and Fitbit compliance rates. Completion rates for monthly and follow-up PRO surveys were even higher, with average end-of-month completion rates ranging from 97% to 100%, and follow-up completion rates of 95% for both time points. Again, these rates did not differ by study arm. The data were represented by 3 engagement groups: high-compliance-all data; high-compliance-PROs and steps only; and moderate PRO compliance-low Fitbit compliance. Group membership was predicted by both race (P<.001) and relationship to the care recipient (P=.001), but not by the other person-specific variables. The compliance rates for this intensive study design are consistent, but at the high end, with what has been reported previously in the literature for studies with shorter time durations. Except for race and relationship to the care recipient, person-specific factors did not appear to be significantly associated with the engagement group. As such, we anticipate that the high compliance rates observed in this study are likely due to several study-specific design elements that were used to encourage study engagement.",

The objectives were to assess the feasibility of a standardized manual method for the offline fusion of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in demonstrating normal fetal brain development and to evaluate its potential clinical use throughout pregnancy.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a prospective study conducted at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, Paris, France, from January to September 2021. We included normal singleton pregnancies between 16\u2009+\u20090 and 36\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks' gestation. Each patient underwent a 3D-US scan, with and without Micro-Vascularization Imaging Doppler, immediately followed by a T2-weighted MRI examination (1.5\u2009Tesla) of the fetal brain. 3D-US and MRI images were merged using at least three registration landmarks, using modified 4D View Fusion software. The primary outcome was the success of US-MRI fusion imaging in obtaining three usable orthogonal planes. Secondary outcomes were the rate of entire neurosonogram visualization (on 3D-US acquisitions, MRI stacks and US-MRI fusion imaging) and the rate of visualization of each International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) neurosonogram anatomical landmark.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 113 pregnant women were included in the analysis. We obtained usable datasets in the three orthogonal planes for 3D-US and MRI in 87.6%\u00a0(99/113) and 97.3% (110/113) of cases respectively. Usable US-MRI fusion imaging in the three planes was achieved in 85.8% (85/99) of cases. The entire neurosonogram was obtained in 9.4% (8/85), 74.1% (63/85) and 87.1% (74/85) respectively of 3D-US acquisitions, MRI stacks and US-MRI fusion imaging volumes (P\u2009<\u20090.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>We present a promising offline 3D-US-MRI fusion imaging tool that permits navigation within two merged volumes acquired on the same day. This technique seems easily achievable and may be of value for educational purposes and longitudinal follow up of fetal brain development in cases with increased risk of brain abnormalities. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>This single-center experience assesses the technical feasibility of a modified chest-knee position for transvaginal female urethral diverticulectomy. The approach was developed to address ergonomic challenges and intraoperative visualization limitations associated with conventional lithotomy positioning during pelvic floor reconstruction.<h4>Clinical presentation</h4>Six female patients (mean age: 42.67 years, normal BMI) presented with symptomatic uncomplicated mid/distal urethral diverticula (mean maximum diameter: 3.68\u00a0cm), presenting with dysuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, and palpable vaginal masses. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) was utilized as the primary diagnostic modality, with MRI employed for suspected complex cases (e.g., multiloculation or sphincteric involvement).<h4>Intervention and outcomes</h4>All patients underwent diverticulectomy under general anesthesia using the modified chest-knee position, which optimized anterior vaginal wall exposure. A layered closure technique preserved 5-10% of the diverticular wall to reduce urethral trauma. Key outcomes included a mean operative duration of 67.5\u2009\u00b1\u200928.3\u00a0min and mean positioning setup time of 8-10\u00a0min. No major perioperative complications (urethrovaginal fistula, stress incontinence) occurred. During a mean follow-up of 28.67 months (range: 11-74), all patients maintained complete symptom resolution without sonographic evidence of recurrence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This experience demonstrates the technical feasibility and perioperative safety of the modified chest-knee position for mid/distal urethral diverticulectomy. While technically feasible in our cohort, the limited sample size precludes definitive conclusions regarding ergonomic advantages or clinical superiority; consequently, further validation studies are warranted to substantiate these findings.",

      "abstractText": "Dual-energy imaging offers several benefits, including artifact reduction and material decomposition. This imaging may be achieved via multiple detecting layers with beam hardening between layers creating spectral separation. We describe the construction, characterization, and clinical translation of a novel prototype dual-layer flat-panel detector for kV on-board radiotherapy imaging. The dual-layer imager (DLI) was designed with the first layer matching existing detector construction: CsI scintillator and a-Si TFT photodiode array. The second layer has a slightly thicker CsI scintillator, providing extra photon detection efficiency. The prototype DLI was built by an industry partner. For clinical deployment, top layer information was sent to the treatment console; data from both layers was sent to a research PC for retrospective analysis. Modulation transfer function (MTF(f)) and noise power spectrum (NPS(f)) were measured for the top, bottom, and combined layers. Detective quantum efficiency (DQE(f)) was calculated from the results. Leeds phantom imaging further assessed detector performance. Initial patient data was analyzed to determine material decomposition feasibility. Log-weighted subtraction and virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) were generated. The DLI was deployed on a clinical TrueBeam linac. For 120kVp the DQE(0) top layer:0.48; bottom layer (using initial fluence):0.13; combined:0.61. Leeds contrast-to-noise ratio with top layer as baseline: bottom layer:-45.8%; combined:+12.4%. MTF50 went from 1.38 top layer to 0.96 combined. Initial log-weighted subtraction of layers of patients' lung kV's successfully suppressed bone material. VMIs were generated: 40keV increased soft tissue contrast by 1.6x; 120keV increased uniformity in metal artifact regions by 41.4%. A novel kV DLI was constructed and translated on a clinical linac. Combining the layers increases DQE with an MTF reduction. More importantly, it adds dual-energy imaging capabilities to a linac. Preliminary results show promise for spectral imaging applications, such as metal artifact reduction and bone removal to enable better lung tumor visualization.",

      "abstractText": "This study explores diabetic foot (DF), a severe complication in diabetes, by combining deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) to develop a multi-model prediction tool. Early identification of high-risk DF patients can reduce disability and mortality. The research also aims to create an integrated application to assist clinicians in precise, efficient risk assessment for early intervention. In this multicenter retrospective study, 6,180 elderly diabetic patients (aged 60-85) were enrolled from 11 community hospitals in Shanghai in 2024. Lasso regression was used to identify 16 key DF risk factors, including age, MMSE score, lower limb discomfort, ABI, and hematocrit. Fourteen ML models (RF, XGBoost, CART, MLP, etc.) and three DL models (DNN, CNN, Transformer) were trained, with hyperparameters optimized via cross-validation and grid search. An application was developed integrating these models, offering both single and batch prediction options with visualization tools for clinical use.Experimental results showed the Logistic regression ensemble model achieved robust performance, with AUC values of 0.943 (validation set, 95% CI: 0.935-0.951) and 0.938 (test set, 95% CI: 0.929-0.947), along with high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. SHAP analysis revealed key predictive features including ABI results, lower limb discomfort, and MMSE score. The developed app integrates multiple models, compares their predictions for different clinical scenarios, and enhances prediction transparency and reliability.The multi-model approach demonstrates strong predictive performance for DF risk, offering clinicians an intuitive and accurate assessment tool tailored to individual patients. By combining multiple models, we enhance result stability and clinical applicability compared to single-model approaches. Future work will focus on algorithm optimization, expanded datasets, and real-time monitoring integration to enable more precise, dynamic risk evaluation for improved DF prevention and early intervention.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Approximately 5 billion people worldwide lack adequate access to surgical care, primarily in the Global South. Especially in crisis regions and war zones, telemedical applications may enhance health services. This study explores the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced 3D imaging and extended reality (XR) technologies for intercontinental surgical case conferences in a low-resource scenario in Uganda. Our pilot study aims to assess the value of these technologies to address the lack of surgical resources and multilateral knowledge exchange.<h4>Objective</h4>This study intends to determine the feasibility of using new AI-enhanced image modeling technology within an immersive spatial XR scenario to collaboratively and remotely assess reconstructive patient cases in the resource-limited country of Uganda.<h4>Methods</h4>Within a surgical camp at Lamu Medical Centre, Uganda, 3D models of patients' conditions were created using a smartphone app. Digital models were generated from photographs taken on-site and processed into 3D formats to be visualized in virtual case conferences. Here, surgeons from Uganda and Germany used virtual reality (VR) headsets to collaboratively discuss case strategies while marking surgical approaches on each digital patient model.<h4>Results</h4>The study included 15 patients requiring reconstructive surgery, with a diverse range of conditions. The use of XR technology facilitated detailed visualization and discussion of surgical strategies. The process was time-efficient, with a total of under 8 minutes per case for data acquisition and model creation, and resource-efficient with surgeons reporting sufficient quality of smartphone-derived models. Valuable user experience and precise interaction during the VR case processing were found, underlining its potential to improve surgical planning and patient care in resource-limited settings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings indicate that AI-enhanced 3D imaging and immersive virtual communication platforms are valuable tools for integrative surgical case assessments. The cost-effectiveness of the used consumer solutions should be especially beneficial for low-resource environments. While the study demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, further research is needed to explore a broader application and impact of these technologies in global health. The study highlights the potential of XR to enhance training and surgical precision, contributing to better health care outcomes in underserved regions.",

      "abstractText": "Thyroid ultrasound has emerged as a critical diagnostic modality, attracting substantial research attention. This bibliometric analysis systematically maps the 30-year evolution of thyroid ultrasound research to identify developmental trends, research hotspots, and emerging frontiers. English-language articles and reviews (1994-2023) from Web of Science Core Collection were extracted. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to examine collaborative networks among countries/institutions/authors, reference timeline visualization, and keyword burst detection. A total of 8,489 documents were included for further analysis. An overall upward trend in research publications was found. China, the United States, and Italy were the productive countries, while the United States, Italy, and South Korea had the greatest influence. The journal Thyroid obtained the highest IF. The keywords with the greatest strength were \"disorders\", \"thyroid volume\", and \"association guidelines\". The timeline view of reference demonstrated that deep learning, ultrasound-based risk stratification systems, and radiofrequency ablation were the latest reference clusters. Three dominant themes emerged: the ultrasound characteristics of thyroid disorders, the application of new techniques, and the assessment of the risk of malignancy of thyroid nodules. Applications of deep learning and the development and improvement of correlation guides such as TIRADS are the present focus of research. The specific application efficacy and improvement of TI-RADS and the optimization of deep learning algorithms and their clinical applicability will be the focus of subsequent research.",

      "abstractText": "Arthritis, a prevalent degenerative joint disorder characterized by progressive pain, swelling, and stiffness, frequently progresses to irreversible joint deformity and functional impairment. Early diagnosis remains critical yet challenging, as conventional clinical imaging techniques often fail to detect pathological changes until advanced stages, significantly compromising therapeutic outcomes. To address these limitations, engineered nanoprobes have emerged as next-generation diagnostic tools leveraging dual targeting mechanisms: passive accumulation via the enhanced permeability and retention effect in arthritic tissues, and active targeting through surface-conjugated antibodies or disease-specific ligands. These nanostructures exhibit remarkable adaptability, with designs responsive to pathophysiological cues such as synovial pH fluctuations, local hyperthermia, oxidative stress and disease-specific biomarkers. Modern nanoprobe platforms integrate multimodal imaging capabilities, synergizing near-infrared II fluorescence (NIR-II), photoacoustic imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to achieve unprecedented spatial resolution and detection sensitivity. Innovatively, certain theranostic nanoprobes coload therapeutic agents with contrast media, enabling real-time visualization of drug delivery kinetics and treatment efficacy. Their biomarker-specific responsiveness permits dynamic monitoring of early inflammatory cascades and subclinical cartilage degradation\u2500processes undetectable by traditional diagnostics. This review systematically examines cutting-edge nanoprobe designs that simultaneously detect oxidative stress markers, microenvironmental changes, and arthritis-specific biomarkers through spatiotemporally resolved multimodal imaging. We highlight their capacity to transform molecular signatures into quantifiable imaging signals, thereby facilitating precision diagnosis, longitudinal disease tracking, and personalized therapeutic regimens. While preclinical studies demonstrate exceptional promise, key challenges persist in optimizing biocompatibility profiles, ensuring precise targeting efficiency, and translating these technologies into clinical practice. Future advancements will require interdisciplinary collaboration to refine material engineering strategies and validate clinical utility, ultimately positioning nanoprobes as indispensable tools for revolutionizing arthritis management.",

Whilst spontaneous improvement may occur in a significant number of cases (48-70%), in the absence of recovery, multiple operations have been used to improve the airway. This review aims to analyse recent literature surrounding the management of BVFP and discuss changes in practice. Suture lateralization in neonates is an emerging trend and has been recently reported to have good success rates in managing BVFP and preventing tracheostomy. Laryngeal electromyography (L-EMG) may be used to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate from fixation. Corticobulbar motor-evoked potentials (Co-MEPs) is a complimentary technique to L-EMG, which studies the corticobulbar tract and enables visualization of the motor pathway from the brainstem to the peripheral nerves. Currently, there is no reliable method available to predict prognosis. Recent comprehensive reviews of the published literature have described the outcomes for surgical intervention, with no technique proving clearly superior overall. The wide range of aetiologies and the variable recovery rates mean standardized management of BVFP is not possible. L-EMG is not a reliable prognostic indicator of recovery. There is an emerging trend of suture lateralization to avoid tracheostomy. Extensive recent reviews have not identified a lateralization procedure that is superior overall. Small numbers of bilateral reinnervation have reported worldwide (n\u200a=\u200a26) with some vocal cord recovery reported but relatively low decannulation rates at present (66%).",

      "abstractText": "The effects of the aortic geometry on its mechanics and blood flow, and subsequently on aortic pathologies, remain largely unexplored. The main obstacle lies in obtaining patient-specific aorta models, an extremely difficult procedure in terms of ethics and availability, segmentation, mesh generation, and all of the accompanying processes. Contrastingly, idealized models are easy to build but do not faithfully represent patient-specific variability. Additionally, a unified aortic parametrization in clinic and engineering has not yet been achieved. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new set of statistical parameters to generate synthetic models of the aorta. The parameters possess geometric significance and fall within physiological ranges, effectively bridging the disciplines of clinical medicine and engineering. Smoothly blended realistic representations are recovered with convolution surfaces. These enable high-quality visualization and biological appearance, whereas the structured mesh generation paves the way for numerical simulations. The only requirement of the approach is one patient-specific aorta model and the statistical data for parameter values obtained from the literature. The output of this work is SynthAorta, a dataset of ready-to-use synthetic, physiological aorta models, each containing a centerline, surface representation, and a structured hexahedral finite element mesh. The meshes are structured and fully consistent between different cases, making them imminently suitable for reduced order modeling and machine learning approaches.",

      "abstractText": "Male breast cancer (MBC), a rare disease accounting for less than 1% of all cancers in men and approximately 1% of all breast cancers globally, exhibits unique biological and clinical characteristics that distinguish it from female breast cancer (FBC). To identify the latest developments and trends in MBC research, we performed a comprehensive analysis of relevant literature and generated visual representations of the data. Building on these outcomes, we delve into the insights gained, aiming to enhance the ongoing comprehension of MBC. We conducted a search of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) for English-language articles and reviews on MBC published from 1982 to 2024. Following a rigorous dual-researcher screening process, we refined the dataset to 6802 relevant records. Subsequently, we employed Microsoft Excel for initial data organization and processing. For in-depth analysis and visualization of journal, country/region, author/institution trends, as well as keyword patterns, we utilized a combination of R Package, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. This multi-tool approach enabled us to extract and present meaningful insights from the data. MBC research has risen since 1996, with a 2024 peak at 503 publications, reflecting advances like BRCA1/2 gene discoveries. The USA leads in publications and citations, with North America and Europe being the most collaborative regions. Key journals include Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, and leading contributors are Ottini, Laura and Van Diest, Paul J. Research focuses on MBC's genetic links (e.g. BRCA mutations) and clinical features, with emerging topics like precision medicine and immunotherapy. MBC research has grown but remains concentrated in high-income countries. Future efforts should explore MBC's unique biology, improve diagnostic/therapeutic strategies, and involve global, interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance patient outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) require precise imaging of both osseous and soft-tissue components for accurate diagnosis. Current diagnostic protocols often necessitate separate cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, increasing cost, complexity, and patient burden. This study aimed to develop and validate the Sivan 3D CBCT Volumetric Imaging Protocol, a novel post-processing technique designed to enable simultaneous high-resolution visualization of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc, retrodiscal tissue, and adjacent osseous structures using a single CBCT data set. This retrospective study analyzed anonymized CBCT volumes from 42 patients diagnosed with TMD. The data sets were processed using NNT software, incorporating dual-mode volumetric rendering, voxel intensity modulation, and anisotropic filtering. Fifteen expert raters assessed conventional CBCT, enhanced CBCT, and MR images across eight diagnostic parameters using a 5-point Likert scale. Inter- and intra-rater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and statistical comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc test, and Cohen's d effect size analysis. Enhanced CBCT images showed excellent inter- and intra-rater reliability (ICC\u2009>\u20090.95) and significantly outperformed conventional CBCT and MRI in visualizing both soft and hard TMJ structures (p\u2009<\u20090.001), with large effect sizes (Cohen's d\u2009>\u20092.3), especially for disc and retrodiscal tissue delineation. The Sivan 3D CBCT Volumetric Imaging Protocol provides a robust, single-modality alternative to MRI for comprehensive TMJ evaluation, improving diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility in clinical settings with limited MRI availability.",

Each eye underwent AS-OCTA imaging using the BMizar 400kHz Full-Range Swept-Source OCT system at baseline and after administration of 10% phenylephrine (PE). FlowArea (mm<sup>2</sup>) was automatically calculated across predefined circular regions of interest (ROIs) encompassing the cornea, limbus and episclera. In corneal and limbal ROIs, en face images were segmented into three depth layers: total (epithelium to endothelium), superficial (epithelium to 150 \u00b5m) and deep (150 \u00b5m to endothelium).<h4>Results</h4>CoNV eyes exhibited significantly higher total and deep corneal FlowArea compared with controls (p=0.0002\u2009and p=0.0005, respectively). Post PE, a significant reduction in FlowArea was observed in the total and deep corneal layers of CoNV eyes (p=0.006\u2009and p=0.009, respectively), and in the limbal region of both groups, with significant reductions observed in CoNV and controls (p=0.006\u2009and p=0.003, respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This AS-OCTA platform enabled high-resolution, depth-resolved visualization of CoNV and revealed vascular changes following topical vasoconstriction. The extended field of view allowed simultaneous assessment of corneal, limbal and episcleral vasculature within a single scan session, supporting its potential role in both diagnostic evaluation and longitudinal monitoring of anterior segment diseases.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Uveitis encompasses inflammatory conditions affecting the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Its management relied on corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and, more recently, biologic therapies. The development of sustained-release intravitreal corticosteroid delivery systems, like dexamethasone intravitreal implants, has revolutionized the treatment of posterior uveitis.<h4>Objectives</h4>To critically appraise the evidence of the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone implants in managing Uveitis.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone implants in managing Uveitis was conducted. A comprehensive and systematic electronic database search was conducted in Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Wiley Online Library for studies published from their inception to the present date. Modified PICOS criteria were used to screen and select the eligible studies from the potential articles retrieved from the database search. Studies were considered if they included patients with uveitis. A comprehensive risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies, the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies (ROBINS-I) tool for non-randomized trials, the risk of bias visualization tool (ROB 2.0) tool for RCTs, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool for Interventional case-series. Data were then procedurally extracted and analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>The study selection process identified 29 studies, including 1,086 eyes. Dexamethasone implant significantly reduced central retinal/macular thickness at all time points: 150.4\u00a0\u03bcm at 1\u00a0month (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), 200.8\u00a0\u03bcm at 3\u00a0months (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and 225.5\u00a0\u03bcm at 6-24\u00a0months (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Inflammation control was achieved in 80.8\u00a0% of cases (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Visual acuity improvements were modest at 6\u00a0months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.078) but significant long-term (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, the dexamethasone implant resulted in cataract formation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010), with a recurrence rate of 0.501 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.968).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Dexamethasone implants offer clinically significant benefits, resulting in substantial reductions in central retinal thickness, improvements in visual acuity, and effective control of inflammation in patients with uveitis.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Depression, affecting 350\u2009million people globally, is notably prevalent among medical students, particularly in South Asia, including Bangladesh. Despite several studies, no meta-analysis has systematically examined the prevalence and contributing factors of depression to address the mental health burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol aims to consolidate findings on the regional prevalence and key risk factors among Bangladeshi medical students.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>The research team will search the Medline (Pubmed), Scopus, Web of science, Embase, PsycInfo, BanglaJOL and Google Scholar electronic databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for published studies from their inception till 1<sup>St</sup> March 2025, using truncated and phrase-searched keywords and relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSHs). Observational studies, including cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies published within the timeframe and following any validated depression assessment tools, with no language restriction, reporting bangladeshi medical students, will be included for the review. Review papers, intervention studies, commentaries, preprints, meeting abstracts, protocols, unpublished studies and letters will be excluded. Two independent reviewers (SS, IA) will screen the retrieved papers using Rayyan, a web-based application, while any disagreements between them will be resolved by a third reviewer (ATS). Exposure will refer to different factors associated with depression among Bangladeshi medical students. Prevalence of depression and associated factors will be extracted. Narrative synthesis (Qualitative information) and meta-analysis (Quantitative data) will be conducted to assess the pooled prevalence using the random-effects meta-analysis (REML) model. For enhanced visualisation of the included studies, forest and funnel plots will be constructed. Heterogeneity among the studies will be assessed using the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic, sensitivity,and subgroup analyses will be conducted, if necessary, based on study heterogeneity. The quality of the included studies will be assessed using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (mNOS) tool developed for observational study designs. All statistical analyses and visualization will be conducted using the R studio v.4.3.2 with built-in \"meta\"-packages and GraphPad Prism v.9.0.2.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This review will analyse existing published evidence. Findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated through conferences, policy forums and stakeholders to guide future research and interventions.<h4>Prospero registration number</h4>CRD 420251006480.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>A significant percentage of melanomas are refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapies and combinations. As there are currently no effective second-line therapies available for ICI-resistant patients, we sought to identify novel checkpoint inhibitor combinations for future clinical evaluation.<h4>Methods</h4>We used responding and resistant SM1, SW1 and B16-10 melanoma models to explore the mechanism of action of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)+lymphocyte activation gene (LAG-3), anti-PD-1+cytotoxic lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), the anti-PD-1+LAG-3+CTLA-4 triplet, the anti-PD-1+T-cell immunoglobin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) doublet and the anti-PD-1+LAG-3+TIM-3 triplet. Flow cytometry, tetramer binding assays, T-cell depletion and analysis of the tumor-draining lymph nodes were used to determine the mechanisms of action of the ICI combinations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from patients with melanoma was additionally analyzed to determine immune checkpoint expression across T-cell subsets and their association with ICI resistance.<h4>Results</h4>The PD-1+CTLA-4+LAG-3 triplet combination had good efficacy in the SM1 and B16-F10 melanoma models and led to a more favorable immune microenvironment (increased CD69+CD8+ T cells and gp-100-tumor specific T cells, reduced exhausted T cells) than either doublet. The ICI-resistant SW1 model did not respond to the PD-1+CTLA-4+LAG-3 triplet and was characterized by an accumulation of TIM-3+terminally exhausted CD8+T cells. Targeting of TIM-3 using the anti-PD-1+LAG-3+TIM-3 triplet led to complete tumor regressions in the SW1 and SM1 models. The TIM-3-based triplet decreased exhausted CD8+T cells and regulatory T cells, increased numbers of gp-100 reactive CD8+T cells and increased progenitor-exhausted CD8+T cells (TCF7+Ki67+ TIM-3-) numbers in tumor-draining lymph nodes. scRNA-Seq analysis demonstrated that TIM-3 levels were higher in the CD8+T cells of patients with melanoma who were non-responsive to immunotherapy. PD-1 and TIM-3 expression was strongly correlated in the CD8+T cells from patients with melanoma, providing the rationale for co-targeting these checkpoints.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Melanoma models characterized by high levels of terminally exhausted CD8+T cells (TIM-3+) can be successfully treated with the anti-PD-1+LAG-3+TIM-3 combination. The observation that high TIM-3 expression in CD8+T cells is associated with ICI resistance suggests the potential utility of anti-TIM-3-based combinations as a second-line treatment strategy in patients with advanced melanoma.",
