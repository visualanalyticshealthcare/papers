      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>A medication is considered unreconciled when there is no documented administration or the dispensed amount does not match the amount administered, wasted, or returned. Unreconciled dispenses pose several issues, including inaccurate accounting of controlled substances, potential financial discrepancies, possible masking of controlled substance diversion, and patient safety concerns. Utilization of an electronic health record (EHR) report of unreconciled dispenses is one of several possible surveillance methods to track unreconciled dispenses and detect potential controlled substance diversion.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study is to determine the extent to which the utilization of an EHR reporting dashboard by nursing leaders decreases the number of unreconciled controlled substance dispenses.<h4>Methods</h4>An existing report available through the EHR will be used to identify a baseline of unreconciled dispenses. A dashboard was built to include the unreconciled dispenses report that provided real-time data as well as a visualization of historical data. This dashboard was integrated into the nursing leadership workflow on several pilot units covering different levels of care and reviewed regularly for potential intervention. Nurse managers were expected to communicate directly with nurses that had unreconciled controlled substance dispenses and re-educate on appropriate documentation procedures.<h4>Results</h4>During the pre-intervention period, there were a total of 26,101 controlled substance dispenses with 256 unreconciled dispenses (0.98%). Following implementation of the dashboard report, there was a non-significant decrease of 0.13% (p = 0.14) with a total of 24,731 controlled substance dispenses and 211 unreconciled dispenses (0.85%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of an EHR dashboard report has the potential to improve the documentation of controlled substances by identifying opportunities to correct unreconciled dispenses. However, workflow barriers can impact the utility of and engagement with the dashboard report.",

The objective of this study is to utilize bibliometric methods to identify research trends and significant topics within this domain, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in this field.<h4>Methods</h4>The Web of Science Core Collection (January 1, 2015 to October 3, 2024) served as the basis for analyzing 3,941 documents using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. The analysis focused on country/institution collaboration networks, keyword co-occurrence, and hotspot evolution.<h4>Results</h4>Between 2015 and 2024, the number of publications in this field demonstrated an upward trend, characterised by fluctuations. China and the United States were the leading contributors to global research output, with China contributing 1,387 papers, accounting for 35.19% of the total, and boasting an H-index of 62. In contrast, the United States contributed 1,047 papers, with an h-index of 74. In recent years, research has been concentrated on four major technological directions, including neural electrical stimulation, biomaterial scaffolds, gene editing, and neural modulation.<h4>Discussion</h4>This transformation in scholarly focus reflects the convergence of multiple catalytic factors, which have enabled the sophisticated simulation of neural systems, provided unprecedented analytical tools for neuroscience inquiry, and intensified societal demands for artificial intelligence applications and neurotechnology innovations, thereby stimulating accelerated research investment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Over the past decade, researchers worldwide have focused on neural regeneration. Bibliometric analyses have assessed scholarship, identified research hotspots, summarized core concepts, and provided valuable insights for future research in this field.",

      "abstractText": "The global health community must extend its attention beyond the \"first 1000 days\" to include school-aged children (i.e., the \"next 7000 days\") given the critical windows of development during this period. An opportunity exists to leverage school settings to implement programs for supporting child health and nutrition. Historically, many school-based programs evaluate \"learning\" or academic achievement as a priority outcome, with less attention paid to the \"learner.\" This has left gaps in studying the impact school nutrition programs and interventions may have on children's health and development, and how to measure these outcomes. The \"Biomarkers of Nutrition for Development: Knowledge Indicating Dietary Sufficiency (BOND-KIDS)\" Project primarily focused on these gaps - specifically, the need for better tools to measure the functional impact of school-based nutritional interventions on the health and development of school-aged children, ages 5-19 years. Functionally, BOND-KIDS applied an ecological approach via the organization of 4 interacting thematic working groups (WG): 1) Biology (internal environment), 2) Environment (external; home, school, physical), 3) Assessment, 4) Translation and implementation. This report represents the work of WG 3: Assessment, which addresses the specific need for better assessment tools, and also includes general considerations for nutritional assessment in children. We included the evidence, relevance, and feasibility of current approaches in assessing dietary intake, nutritional status, and key functional outcomes for the developing school-aged children. The findings will help to determine context-specific approaches to assess the need for and impact of interventions designed to improve the diet, nutrition, and health of school-aged children. To increase utility and accessibility, the data contained in this report are accessible via a self-service online dashboard. The current version of this dashboard is hosted at https://www.cpnh.cornell.edu/bond-kids-1, via the Cornell Joan Klein Jacobs Center for Precision Nutrition and Health at Cornell University.",

Emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, the paper highlights the roles of pediatric radiologists, cardiologists, engineers, and physicians with expertise in computer-aided design (CAD) for effective implementation. The review covers a range of imaging tools, from low-cost virtual reality, mixed reality, and three-dimensional (3D) printing to more advanced technologies, and explores their clinical applications in CHD. Through a literature analysis, the paper offers practical insights to help integrate and optimize these technologies, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care.",

This study aimed to analyze publication trends in metabolic bariatric surgery and mental health, identify leading countries, institutions, authors, and collaborations, and reveal key hotspots and future research directions.<h4>Methods</h4>A bibliometric analysis of publications spanning 1998 to 2024 was performed. Key bibliometric indicators including publication, citation counts, and collaborative networks. Network structures and cluster clarity were measured using modularity Q and weighted mean silhouette. Data visualization tools mapped emerging research themes and highlight leading contributors.<h4>Results</h4>Our study revealed a steady increase in publications and citations related to metabolic bariatric surgery and mental health from 1998 to 2024. The USA led in document count, citations, and international collaboration, with prominent institutions like the University of Pittsburgh contributing significantly to the field. The top journals were Obesity Surgery, and Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, while the most cited articles were by Adams TD (2007) and Schauer PR (2017). Keyword trends shifted from surgical techniques to the psychological impacts of metabolic bariatric surgery, with terms like morbid obesity, gastric bypass, and mental health remaining central, while newer areas like cardiovascular risks and long-term outcomes emerged as new hotspots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Bibliometric trends demonstrate growth but underscore challenges in global research access. Future research should address methodological issues and healthcare disparities, with a focus on standardizing training, clinical trials, and outcomes. Promising study areas include eating and alcohol-related disorders, cardiovascular, and long-term psychological health.",

The Dashboard Instrument to Review Equity (DIRE) Framework and Checklist tool was developed to be a practical tool for public health departments to use in evaluating equity-based decision support mechanisms in their dashboards.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this agreement and reliability study was to validate the DIRE Checklist tool as a practical and reliable instrument for data practitioners to use in evaluating dashboards.<h4>Methods</h4>This study was divided into five steps to conduct the necessary analysis for agreement and reliability. Step 1 completed the development of the DIRE Checklist tool in Qualtrics. Step 2 focused on the parameters required for the selection of the 26 U.S. state-based dashboards. Step 3 was the user testing and assessment process for each reviewer to apply the DIRE tool to each dashboard. Step 4 was the different assessment methods conducted to specifically calculate the comparative analysis, inter-rater agreement, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), and the cosine similarity for the Qualtrics, Reviewer, and Categorical scores. And lastly was Step 5 to conduct any qualitative assessment required on the notes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 26 dashboards were evaluated with the DIRE Checklist tool by 2 reviewers. The overall percentage comparison for the Qualtrics Score was 31.7% for Reviewer 1 and 41.8% for Reviewer 2, resulting in a percent agreement of 72.7%. Additionally, the Categorical Scores saw substantial to high agreement across most categories for the percent agreement within each Category. The ICC score saw varying levels of agreement across different categories, with good agreement in the Qualtrics score.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reliability and agreement result of the study confirmed strong performance of the DIRE Checklist tool. The scores calculated were evaluated consistently and reliably by both raters-demonstrating the DIRE Checklist tool's ability to robustly evaluate different dashboards across a number of different categories and parameters.<h4>Clinicaltrial</h4>",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are increasingly encountered in nonendemic settings due to migration, international travel, and global mobility. Their clinical management is often challenging: evidence from endemic regions is limited or not directly applicable, and healthcare providers are frequently unfamiliar with their diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, there is substantial heterogeneity in diagnostic workup, therapeutic choices, and follow-up strategies, which may affect patient outcomes and complicate guideline development. Given the sporadic presentation of these diseases across individual centers and the overall low caseload in nonendemic settings, conducting randomized controlled trials to define optimal strategies is largely unfeasible. To address these gaps, we designed Tropistry, a modular, multicenter registry that integrates harmonized data collection with embedded expert-informed clinical guidance.<h4>Methods</h4>Tropistry is an ambispective, multicenter registry planned for implementation across Belgian and European sites. Its modular structure will allow the sequential integration of disease-specific components, initially focusing on acute schistosomiasis and cutaneous/mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (CL/MCL), selected for their sporadic occurrence, clinical complexity, and lack of standardized management. Data will be collected through REDCap-based electronic case report forms aligned with up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations to ensure harmonized and comparable data collection. Embedded expert-informed guidance will support clinicians unfamiliar with these diseases, complemented by expedited access to ITM experts via TROPmail and aggregated feedback through an interactive R Shiny-based dashboard. A structured evaluation framework will assess feasibility, usability, data quality, user engagement, and treatment adherence to ensure the platform's utility and validity.<h4>Expected impact</h4>By centralizing harmonized data on diagnostic and therapeutic practices, Tropistry aims to address critical knowledge gaps in managing NTDs in nonendemic settings. For the initial targeted conditions, it will help clarify optimal strategies, such as the combination of corticosteroids and praziquantel for acute schistosomiasis and best practices for therapy and follow-up in CL/MCL. Beyond data collection, Tropistry will provide embedded expert-informed guidance, interactive dashboards, and direct access to ITM experts to support clinicians and promote standardized care. Its modular design will enable expansion to other challenging NTDs, while the built-in evaluation framework ensures continuous assessment and optimization of feasibility, usability, and clinical utility. Ultimately, Tropistry seeks to strengthen collaboration between reference centers and non-specialized facilities and generate robust real-world evidence to inform clinical practice, guideline development, and future trials.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background and objectives</h4>This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of near-infrared fluorescence using indocyanine green (ICG) for intra-operative identification of cystic duct and artery anatomy, including aberrations, during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective observational non-blinding study was conducted from November 2019 to February 2023, enrolling 67 adult patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Indocyanine green (0.2\u00a0mg/kg) was administered six to 10\u00a0hours before surgery. Visualization of the cystic duct, common bile duct (CBD) and cystic artery was assessed using near-infrared fluorescence imaging. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to identify the correlation between demographic and clinical factors with the identification of the cystic duct, CBD and cystic artery. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to identify the correlation between gender and body mass index (BMI) with the identification of the cystic duct, CBD and cystic artery.<h4>Results</h4>The vasculo-biliary structures were visualized with ICG administration. The cystic duct was identified in 88%, the CBD in 92.6% and the cystic artery in 85% (Group-II variant was the commonest). Visualization of the cystic duct was significantly more difficult in male patients, while the visualization of the cystic artery was significantly reduced in patients with a\u2009>\u200925\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Indocyanine green-based near-infrared fluorescence is a safe, feasible and effective tool for enhancing the visualization of vasculo-biliary anatomy during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It aids in preventing bile duct injury and supports safe dissection, particularly in patients with normal BMI. While not a replacement for intra-operative cholangiography, ICG fluorescence is a promising adjunct.",

      "abstractText": "<i>Background:</i> Drug checking is a harm reduction intervention that uses chemical analytical methods to provide information on the composition of illicit drug mixtures. It is necessary to expand the reach of drug checks to fully meet the needs of populations who use drugs who are at risk of overdose. Technical barriers to drug checking, such as software that is challenging to use without extensive training and practice, hinder the expansion of these services.<i>Objectives:</i> This study describes the development, architecture, and deployment of a custom FTIR-based software framework. Components of this framework are useful across several models of drug checking.<i>Methods:</i> A kiosk application controls a spectrometer and uploads the spectral and survey data to a centralized database. An analysis suite facilitates spectral interpretation using libraries, a repository of previous data, and analysis tools. Individual drug checking results are accessible online. Aggregated data are viewed internally via a dashboard. Public-facing reports are tailored to different communities.<i>Results:</i> The software was successfully deployed with a total of 6 remote service sites operating by 2024. Between May 2022 and December 2024, 2673 drug samples were checked for 1926 clients, including hundreds accessing drug checking for the first time. Weekly and monthly reports of aggregate drug data were created.<i>Conclusions:</i> By lowering technical barriers and supporting real-time reporting, our software framework expanded service access and provided actionable data to both communities and public health stakeholders. This method represents a meaningful advancement in the technological infrastructure necessary to sustain and expand drug checking efforts.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objectives</h4>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the visualization capability of orally administered manganese chloride tetrahydrate (ACE-MBCA [Ascelia Pharma-manganese-based contrast agent, also referred to as Orviglance or CMC-001]), a novel liver-specific contrast agent developed by Ascelia Pharma, as a liver-specific MRI contrast agent compared with that of the unenhanced MRI for focal liver lesions in a properly blinded study design. The secondary objective was to compare the performance of ACE-MBCA with gadobenate dimeglumine.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Three independent readers analyzed MRI examinations from a previously completed randomized crossover clinical trial in a blinded manner in a centralized setting. The study included 20 consecutive adult patients with known or suspected liver metastases, who received both ACE-MBCA and gadobenate dimeglumine. The readers evaluated 6 types of MRI scans (unenhanced, enhanced, and combined MRI for both contrast agents) with lesion visualization [lesion border delineation (LBD) and lesion contrast (LC)] as primary outcome. To maintain the blinded nature of the study, all statistical analyses were performed by an independent statistician who was not involved in the image reading process. Differences in primary outcomes were performed using 1-sided paired t tests at a significance level of 0.025 for both parameters. For secondary outcomes (ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI visualization, lesion detection, size measurements, reader confidence, quantitative parameters, and image quality were compared with that of the other scans), descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate differences between categories in comparative analyses, without formal hypothesis testing for most secondary endpoints.<h4>Results</h4>ACE-MBCA-enhanced MRI demonstrated statistically significant superior scoring over unenhanced MRI for visualizing focal liver lesions, with mean LBD scores improving from 1.8-2.3 to 2.4-2.9 and LC scores ranging from 1.8-2.3 to 2.8-3.3 across all 3 readers ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). Compared with unenhanced MRI, ACE-MBCA detected significantly more lesions across all readers (mean differences 0.4-0.8 lesions, 95% CI: 0.04-1.52), particularly for small lesions (<1\u2009cm), where detection improved from 2-6 to 3-12 lesions. Liver-to-lesion contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios were also significantly higher after ACE-MBCA enhancement. All visualization parameters of ACE-MBCA were comparable to those of gadobenate dimeglumine, with no significant differences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared with unenhanced MRI, ACE-MBCA MRI resulted in superior visualization and a greater number of detected liver lesions. ACE-MBCA and gadobenate dimeglumine performed similarly in the visualization and detection of colorectal liver metastases.",

Traditional oral health education has poor knowledge transmission effect. Virtual reality (VR) currently has extensive applications and excellent results in medical education and technical learning. However, its application in oral health education for primary school students has not yet been known.<h4>Methods</h4>A convenience sampling approach was employed to recruit 1,416 children in grades 3-5 from 16 districts of Tianjin City who had previously received traditional oral health education. One week prior to the intervention, parents received a quick response code to access the VR experience and were instructed to guide their children through the smartphone-based learning module. Then, medical staff administered questionnaires to the students in the classroom. VR efficacy was assessed by comparing oral health knowledge, attitudes, and technology acceptance between students exposed to VR and controls. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis H-tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests, and multiple linear regression analysis was employed to elucidate the pivotal factors influencing the efficacy of the oral VR experience.<h4>Result</h4>Children in grades 3-5 in Tianjin exhibited high receptivity to mobile-based VR technology, with a perceived ease of use of 9.03\u2009\u00b1\u20091.36 and a perceived usefulness of 9.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.98. Among the students who experienced oral VR, 398 individuals (75%) reported a significant improvement in their attitudes towards oral health care, while 120 (22.6%) perceived a more substantial improvement. Students who experienced oral VR demonstrates a significant improvement in oral health knowledge (experimental group: 13.00(12.00,13.00) vs. control group: 10.00(8.00,12.00), p\u2009<\u20090.001). Schoolchildren in grade 4, with high father educational level, good brushing habits, and prior VR experience, achieved higher oral knowledge scores after the VR experience, with statistically significant differences observed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We present the first application of mobile virtual reality for oral health education in primary schools. Our study demonstrates high student acceptance of VR technology in Tianjin, China, alongside significant improvements in oral health knowledge and attitudes. Given its efficacy, accessibility, and visualization capabilities, mobile VR represents a promising tool for scalable oral health education.<h4>Trial registration</h4>International Standard Registered Clinical/Social Study Number Registry ISRCTN13464089(17/07/2025) \"Retrospectively registered\".",

Raw data and indicators of population needs and workforce capacity must be transformed into usable intelligence that can support decision-making. Using the case study of integrated primary care workforce planning in Toronto, we outline our workforce planning framework, and with a focus on workforce analysis, describe the inputs and outputs that are needed for planning, key steps in the conversion of data to intelligence, and the impact of the approach. Raw data flow from data partners through a planning model into a six-step workforce analysis that renders the results of data analysis, modelling, synthesis and visualization relevant, and accessible to planners and decision-makers. We highlight important challenges and considerations related to data standardization, comprehensiveness, granularity, accessibility, and timeliness, and envision a system that more effectively supports workforce planning and decision-making.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>Transcatheter valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a pivotal intervention for aortic regurgitation(AR), garnering significant attention over the past two decades. Despite the proliferation of research in this domain, a comprehensive synthesis of the extant literature remains lacking, especially regarding large-scale randomized trials and long-term follow-up data. This study aims to elucidate the evolving landscape and current focal points of TAVR in the context of AR through advanced text mining and knowledge mapping techniques over the past 20 years and to project future development prospects.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic retrieval of medical literature regarding TAVR for AR was conducted within the Web of Science database's Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), encompassing publications from 2004 to 2023. Analytical tools performed bibliometric and visualization analyses, including Microsoft Excel, CiteSpace, Bibliometrics, and VOSviewer.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis encompassed 2,189 publications across 200 journals, revealing a consistent upward publication volume and citation frequency trend. Notably, Leon, Martin B, Webb, John G, and Rodes-Cabau, Josep emerged as the most prolific scholars, while Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions ranked as the journal with the highest output. Geographically, the United States, Germany, and Italy led in publication output. The top 10 institutions with the most considerable influence were all from the European and American countries. A cluster analysis of the 169 keywords with a frequency exceeding 20 occurrences emphasized integrating procedural innovation, patient-specific risk assessment, and long-term outcome evaluation, highlighting the evolving priorities in advancing TAVR therapy for AR. Furthermore, operative techniques, valve device systems, and bioengineering technologies are likely to emerge as key research directions for the future treatment of AR with TAVR.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study is the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis of TAVR for AR, offering insights into health-oriented research trends. Despite advancements in clinical studies, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and bioengineering, prioritizing translational research to address patient health outcomes remains critical. Bridging innovation and clinical practice is vital to optimize therapeutic efficacy, improve quality of life, and reduce AR's global health burden. Future research should integrate multidisciplinary approaches to enhance TAVR's safety, accessibility, and long-term health benefits for diverse populations.",

We describe using institutional Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database (CHSD) data in real-time to develop a quality framework with the aim of optimizing team performance thus improving clinical outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>A single center retrospective study was undertaken spanning a 8 quarters; 3 quarters pre-implementation (Q4 2022, Q1 2023, Q2 2023), 2 quarters implementation (Q3 2023, Q4 2023) and 3 quarters post-implementation (Q1 2024, Q2 2024, Q3 2024). STS CHSD data are abstracted from charts and input into third-party software and are used to create visual plots for each index procedure at weekly rounds entitled \"Collaborative Multidisciplinary Assessment of Performance Rounds\" (CMAP) and to create an STS Dashboard. STS CHSD unadjusted data and PC4 risk-adjusted clinical outcomes were compared post- vs pre-implementation.<h4>Results</h4>CMAP were instituted in Children's Nebraska Criss Heart Center, July 2023. CMAP attendance median is 59 (range 48-74). The case mix pre- and post-implementation is similar (17.7% STAT 4/5 cases vs 18%). Post-implementation there have been 39 CMAP presenting 223 index procedures. There were trends to decreased risk-adjusted PC4 outcomes post- vs pre-implementation, including failure-to-rescue, major complication, cardiac arrest, seizures, infection and unplanned reintervention. CMAP discussions have resulted in \"CMAP Takeaways\" which have informed quality care initiatives.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data demonstrate the feasibility and power of utilizing real-time STS CHSD unadjusted data to create a quality framework based on transparent data sharing and psychological safety to enhance team performance in congenital heart surgery.",

      "abstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most prevalent malignancies with high mortality, necessitates early intervention and prognostic monitoring to improve patient survival. However, the lack of ideal detection methods remains a critical challenge. \u03b1-L-Fucosidase (AFU), a key lysosomal hydrolase, has emerged as a promising biomarker for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis. Herein, we developed a chemiluminescent probe (<b>AFU-CL</b>) capable of specifically responding to AFU. <b>AFU-CL</b> enables rapid and highly selective AFU detection, exhibiting exceptional sensitivity (limit of detection = 4.87 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup> mU/mL) and superior signal-to-noise ratios compared to conventional fluorescent probes. At the cellular level, AFU-CL enabled real-time visualization of endogenous AFU activity in cultured HCC cells (MHCC-97H), demonstrating distinct signal patterns between malignant and normal hepatocytes (MIHA). Progressing to in vivo imaging, the probe successfully achieved in situ visualization of tumor sites in HCC-bearing mouse models, with its specific chemiluminescent signals clearly distinguishing tumor tissues from normal tissues. Most significantly, this detection capability was effectively translated to clinical applications, as AFU-CL-based analysis reliably differentiated serum samples from HCC patients and healthy controls, confirming the probe's potential for clinical diagnosis. This strategy provides a promising platform for early HCC diagnosis and elucidating the functional role of AFU in cancer progression.",

      "abstractText": "The field of view (FOV) is a critical parameter in optical endoscopic systems that directly influences a physician's ability to inspect internal anatomical structures thoroughly and accurately without repositioning the device. This study designs and optimizes a rigid arthroscope equipped with a fisheye lens to achieve an ultra-wide 200\u00b0 field of view, thereby enhancing joint visualization. The fisheye lens is specifically redesigned and optimized to function as the objective lens, and a gradient-index (GRIN) rod is employed to relay the image from the objective to the eyepiece. The device is optimized for the short working distances of arthroscopy, while its ~0.7-500 mm refocusing range (via minor eyepiece adjustment) also makes it adaptable to endoscopic applications that require longer working distances. Image-quality metrics are used to evaluate aberrations, particularly those caused by the increased viewing angle. While wide viewing angles typically amplify off-axis aberrations, the optimized design reduces and balances these residuals to preserve high image quality, and its performance is benchmarked against a high-definition arthroscope featuring a 70\u00b0 field of view. Overall, the fisheye arthroscope achieves a substantially wider field of view, with aberrations deliberately balanced so that RMS spot sizes remain below the Airy disk, thereby enhancing visualization during clinical joint examinations.",

      "abstractText": "Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are pivotal organelles that maintain cellular homeostasis; their dysfunction initiates pathological cascades associated with both fibrosis and oncogenesis. Bleomycin (BLM), a widely utilized anticancer drug, inhibits tumor growth by inducing DNA damage. However, its clinical application is constrained by severe pulmonary toxicity. Here, we develop a novel fluorescent probe, <b>BDSTI</b>. In contrast to existing probes that target a single organelle, <b>BDSTI</b> allows for efficient colocalization of mitochondria and ER, facilitating the synchronous observation of their interactions. It also exhibits the capability to detect intracellular polarity and viscosity dynamics induced by BLM concentration gradients. BLM disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential and triggers the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). High-resolution imaging further confirms its role in inducing mitochondrial morphological abnormalities. Notably, <b>BDSTI</b> enables the visualization of BLM-induced lung injury through <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> imaging of pulmonary fibrosis models in tumor-bearing mice. Notably, <b>BDSTI</b> enables visualization of BLM-induced lung injury through <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> imaging of pulmonary fibrosis models in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, this probe serves as a functional tool to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of various ER stress inhibitors in mitigating BLM-mediated pulmonary damage.",

However, their design inherently reduces spatial resolution. We present a convolutional neural network (CNN)-transformer demosaicing algorithm, validated on both clinical and preclinical datasets that effectively doubles spatial resolution and improves image quality-substantially enhancing intraoperative cancer visualization.<h4>Aim</h4>We present a CNN-transformer-based demosaicing approach specifically optimized for reconstructing high-resolution color and NIR images acquired by a hexachromatic imaging sensor.<h4>Approach</h4>A hybrid CNN-transformer demosaicing model was developed and trained on color-image datasets, then rigorously evaluated on color and NIR images to demonstrate superior reconstruction quality compared with conventional bilinear interpolation and residual CNN methods.<h4>Results</h4>Our CNN-transformer demosaicing method achieves an average mean squared error (MSE) reduction of \u223c85% for color images and 76% for NIR images and improves structural dissimilarity by roughly 72% and 79%, respectively, compared with state-of-the-art CNN-based demosaicing algorithms in preclinical datasets. In clinical datasets, our approach similarly demonstrates significant reductions in MSE and structural dissimilarity, substantially outperforming existing CNN-based methods, particularly in reconstructing high-frequency image details.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrate improvements in spatial resolution and image fidelity for color and NIR images obtained from hexachromatic imaging sensors, achieved by integrating convolutional neural networks with transformer architectures. Given recent advances in GPU computing, our CNN-transformer approach offers a practical, real-time solution for enhanced multispectral imaging during cancer surgery.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>This study introduces the application of a 12\u00b0 endoscope in unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) decompression surgery for lumbar disc herniation and discusses its advantages in UBE procedures.<h4>Methods</h4>From December 2019 to December 2020, 75 patients (33 men and 42 women) were treated with UBE decompression using a 12\u00b0 endoscope. Patient ages ranged from 26 to 78 years (mean 53.2). Pre- and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for low back and leg pain were recorded. Surgical outcomes were evaluated using MacNab criteria, with operative time and complications documented.<h4>Results</h4>The 12\u00b0 endoscope demonstrated superior maneuverability with a distortion-free visual field. Compared with 30\u00b0 endoscopes, it showed better applicability within the anatomical working triangle while providing broader visualization than 0\u00b0 endoscopes. This enabled effective decompression of the superior articular process medial edge, nerve root canal, and lateral recess. Low back pain VAS scores decreased from 7.3 \u00b1 1.3 to 1.9 \u00b1 1.2 (<i>P</i> < 0.001), while leg pain scores improved from 8.1 \u00b1 1.8 to 1.6 \u00b1 1.0 (<i>P</i> < 0.001). At the 12-month follow-up, MacNab criteria outcomes were excellent in 65.3%, good in 25.3%, and unsatisfactory in 9.3% of cases (<i>\u03c7</i> <sup>2</sup> test, <i>P</i> = 0.002).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The 12\u00b0 endoscope demonstrates clinical value as a feasible, safe, and effective option for UBE surgery in lumbar disc herniation treatment.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Key clinical advantages of the 12\u00b0 endoscope include direct visualization of key anatomical structures, minimized bone resection (particularly at the medial spinous process base), and a reduction in instrument crowding. These technical benefits contribute to effective decompression, improved patient outcomes (as measured by VAS and MacNab criteria), and potentially a shorter learning curve for surgeons adopting the UBE technique.<h4>Level of evidence: 3</h4>",

These include two-dimensional (2D) visualization and malorientation, which can obscure critical diagnostic features, like epithelial-connective tissue interfaces. Micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) offers a non-destructive, high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging alternative to address these challenges. Still, its use for soft tissue visualization is limited. We tested a method with specific radio-opaque staining and \u00b5CT scanning settings to visualize oral soft tissue biopsies as a proof of concept.<h4>Methods</h4>Biopsies from 12 patients with different oral mucosa lesions were stained with Lugol's iodine, scanned at 3\u00b5m resolution with 70kV energy, and the resulting volumes were compared to histopathological sections by specialists in oral radiology and oral pathology.<h4>Results</h4>\u00b5CT produced 2D images with tissue architecture comparable to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections, distinguishing epithelium, connective tissue, and keratin, while 3D reconstructions revealed topographic details, such as ulceration depth and vascular patterns, unattainable in histopathology.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings highlight \u00b5CT potential as a complementary diagnostic tool, enhancing topographic rendering while preserving tissue integrity. Standardized protocols and broader validation, particularly for precancerous and malignant lesions, are essential for clinical adoption, promising improved diagnostic accuracy in oral pathology.",

This trial aims to compare the performance of single-use gastroscopes (SUG) with that of reusable gastroscopes (RUG), in the context of emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Patients with suspected UGIB requiring EGD between March 2023 and April 2024 were randomized, one of which received EGD with a SUG, the other with a RUG. The primary outcome was the complete assessment of the upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) for the presence of a bleeding site.<h4>Results</h4>148 patients were included between 03/2023 and 04/2024. A complete assessment of the UGIT was achieved in 72 of 74 patients with the SUG and in 71 of 74 patients with the RUG, (97.3% vs. 95.9%; p<0.001), however, the bleeding site was identified significantly more frequently in the reusable group (83.8% vs. 68.9%, p=0.033). The need for a therapeutic intervention did not differ between the groups (55.4% vs. 50.0%, p=0.510). Five crossovers to a RUG occurred, largely due to better visualization and user experience. <b>Conclusions: </b>SUG are non-inferior to RUG in the complete assessment of the UGIT in patients with signs of upper GIB, however, a significantly higher rate of bleeding site identification, superior visualization quality, greater acceptance by endoscopists, and a trend toward more effective therapeutic performance was achieved with RUG.",

Previously, most cases were incidentally detected during surgery or in autopsy specimens. Doppler evaluation may also demonstrate these anomalies; however, the sensitivity is poor due to suboptimal visualization of the entire course. With the advent of multidetector CT angiography, these anomalies are increasingly being detected. Although majority of cases are incidentally detected on scans performed for evaluation of congenital heart defects, these anomalies assume clinical importance when central venous cannulation or pacemaker insertion is contemplated through the anomalous side. Prior knowledge of the anomalous anatomy is also important before cardiothoracic surgeries. In this article, we present a pictorial review of the anomalies of the brachiocephalic vein using multidetector CT angiography.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Z-DNA is a left-handed DNA conformation with a zigzag backbone whose formation depends on base composition, modifications, and environmental factors. Although energetically unfavorable, Z-DNA has been implicated in both normal physiology and disease. The Z-Hunt algorithm predicts Z-DNA potential from thermodynamic principles, but its command-line interface and plain-text outputs limit adoption by users without coding expertise.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce Z-GENIE, an R/Shiny GUI that automates Z-Hunt execution, parses its output, and presents interactive visualizations. Z-GENIE accepts FASTA files, NCBI accession IDs, or manual sequences and produces CSV and BED summaries compatible with genomic browsers. In benchmarks on small to medium genomes (<\u200920\u00a0Mb), Z-Hunt completes in minutes and the full Z-GENIE pipeline (data retrieval, parsing, visualization) finishes in under five minutes. For large genomes (>\u200950\u00a0Mb), Z-Hunt may require up to two hours, whereas Z-GENIE's parsing and BED-file export take\u2009<\u20092\u00a0min. In a human ADAM12 case study, Z-GENIE reproduced a published Z-score (3.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910^7) and uncovered orientation-dependent Z-DNA clusters. Another case study compared predictions for Z-DNA in the rice genome (Oryza sativa) with experimental ZIP-Seq and CUT&Tag data; this study highlights the complementarity between in silico and in vivo approaches.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By encapsulating Z-Hunt within an intuitive GUI and offering flexible inputs and downstream-ready outputs, Z-GENIE democratizes genome-wide Z-DNA analysis. Its rapid performance and advanced visualization features should broaden exploration of Z-DNA's roles in health and disease.",

The ability to visualize neuronal cell death is critical for facilitating early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, evaluating therapeutic efficacy, and developing new treatments for these conditions. Positron emission tomography (PET), as a noninvasive imaging tool, enables real-time visualization of biochemical processes <i>in vivo</i> with quantitative information, offering valuable insights into cell death mechanisms in neurodegeneration. This perspective highlights recent advances in PET probes developed to visualize cell death in neurodegenerative diseases, as well as emerging probes targeting mechanisms associated with various forms of neuronal cell death. We anticipate that this perspective will inspire the development of PET imaging probes for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstractText": "Abnormal spinal curvature poses a significant health risk to children and adolescents, highlighting the importance of maintaining good posture for spinal health. However, current posture detection methods face challenges such as insufficient detection accuracy, discomfort during use, and overall inconvenience. This study aims to design and implement a wearable system that integrates angle sensors and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors to monitor spinal alignment and muscle activity in real-time. The system consists of a smart vest equipped with flexible bending sensors and sEMG electrodes, a microcontroller unit for data processing, and a mobile application for data visualization and user feedback. To validate the system's effectiveness, the study involved 65 eligible undergraduate students wearing the device, collecting sEMG signals under different posture conditions, and conducting posture analysis to evaluate the device's performance. The results showed a significant correlation between asymmetric paraspinal muscle activity and the direction of the spinal curve, with the system achieving an accuracy rate of 90.8% in predicting the curve direction using a logistic regression model. Although the system verifies spinal alignment through indirect measurement rather than direct imaging, the high consistency between sEMG asymmetry and expected biomechanical patterns supports its reliability as a functional screening tool. Wearable devices can provide timely posture correction reminders and personalized rehabilitation plans, offering a noninvasive, user-friendly solution for the prevention and rehabilitation of spinal curvature abnormalities.",

      "abstractText": "The clinical challenges in monitoring high-incidence complications in patients with colostomy after colorectal cancer surgery have led to the development of an intelligent monitoring system based on deep learning and augmented reality technology in this study. Traditional care relies on subjective scales for assessment, which has issues such as insufficient sensitivity and delayed response. The existing technical systems also have significant limitations in perception dimensions, environmental adaptability, and decision-making timeliness. Therefore, this study proposes a triple-technology integration solution: by fusing impedance sensing, pH-responsive hydrogels, and 3D depth cameras in a heterogeneous manner, a multi-modal perception network is established to achieve the collaborative collection of physiological and biochemical parameters and morphological features; a cross-modal spatio-temporal fusion network is designed, using dynamic attention mechanisms and differential manifold optimization algorithms to solve the feature coupling problem caused by the heterogeneity of multi-source data; an augmented reality visualization system is developed, combining spatial projection optimization and programmable haptic feedback to build a \"visual-tactile-spatial\" multi-dimensional human-machine interaction channel. The system was verified through multi-center randomized controlled trials, confirming its significant improvement in the early warning performance of complications, enhancement of the standardization of nursing operations, and reduction of medical resource consumption. The core innovation lies in the first introduction of the federated learning framework into the field of colostomy care, combined with neural architecture search for lightweight model deployment, and the quantification of health economic benefits through Markov models. This research marks a paradigm shift in postoperative care from experience-driven to data-driven, providing an extensible technical model for the intelligent monitoring of chronic diseases. In the future, it is necessary to expand the cross-disease transfer learning architecture and develop flexible and degradable sensors to enhance the accessibility of primary medical care.",

We developed a deep learning model to classify insertion depth during VL as shallow, glottic zone, or deep.<h4>Study design</h4>A deep learning model was trained on 298,955 annotated frames from 132 neonatal VL videos from two NICUs on one platform with fivefold cross-validation. 31 clinicians were surveyed regarding preferred device feedback modalities.<h4>Results</h4>The model detected glottic zone and shallow insertion depths with F1 scores of 0.894 and 0.718, respectively. Deep insertion events were rare (2.7%) with low performance (F1\u2009=\u20090.034). Most clinicians preferred visual, minimal prompts over voice or haptic feedback.<h4>Conclusion</h4>AI-enabled VL may support blade-insertion depth assessment and training. Given the rarity of deep events, conclusions about deep insertion and clinical impact are limited. Future multi-site studies should focus on clinical integration and assessing outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Equitable and ethical access to in-vitro fertilization (IVF) remains challenging globally. Existing evaluation frameworks often overlook critical dimensions of reproductive justice. This study develops and validates a Universal IVF Justice Framework, designed to systematically evaluate national IVF policies regarding equity and reproductive autonomy.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic literature review (PubMed, Scopus; January 1, 2010 to June 11, 2025) to identify key policy dimensions and indicators, followed by expert consultations and pilot testing to ensure reliability. The framework was validated through comprehensive document reviews and double-coding of IVF policies from 24 diverse countries. Visualization tools were created to illustrate outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Analysis revealed three overarching dimensions that shape national IVF policy outcomes: economic and structural conditions, cultural and social contexts, and healthcare system factors. Substantial variation emerged across countries. At the micro-level, country-specific analyses exposed targeted strengths and weaknesses, supporting localized reform efforts. Visualizations such as radar and scatter plots highlighted performance disparities. At the macro-level, high-income countries generally scored higher, driven by broader insurance coverage, inclusive legal protections, and greater geographic access. In contrast, low- and middle-income countries often faced challenges in affordability, rural service delivery, LGBTQ+ inclusivity, and psychosocial support.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Universal IVF Justice Framework offers an empirically-grounded and ethically informed approach for evaluating IVF policies globally. By clearly identifying policy strengths and critical gaps, it supports evidence-based decision-making and targeted reforms aimed at enhancing equity and reproductive autonomy in IVF services worldwide.",

      "abstractText": "Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the clinical triad of microtia, patellar hypo- or aplasia, and proportionate short stature. Due to its phenotypic variability and frequent craniofacial anomalies, anesthetic management may be challenging. We report the perioperative management of a 5-year-old boy with genetically confirmed MGS undergoing adenoidectomy, otomicroscopy, and bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion. Preoperative airway evaluation was unremarkable, with no classical predictors of a difficult airway. However, videolaryngoscopy during induction revealed an anterior and deeply positioned glottis with soft, collapsible surrounding structures. Initial intubation with a flexible stylet was unsuccessful; a second attempt using a stiffer stylet was successful under direct visualization. The remaining perioperative course, including extubation and postoperative monitoring, was uneventful. A multidisciplinary planning and individualized anesthetic management enabled safe ambulatory care. To our knowledge, this is the first published case describing anesthetic management in a patient with MGS.",

      "abstractText": "Chemical modification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and their fragments gives rise to imaging probes and targeted therapies. Depending on the isotope used, radiolabeled mAbs enable positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and can also be applied as cytotoxic therapies. Fluorescent mAb conjugates are used for a range of preclinical applications with clinical utility for intraoperative visualization of tumors. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) enhance the therapeutic efficacy of mAbs and are the topic of extensive clinical development. In all these cases, chemical modifications can significantly affect mAb tumor targeting and clearance. Whole-body imaging techniques provide crucial insights into the in vivo consequences of these changes by directly tracking antibody conjugate distribution and clearance. This review examines in vivo imaging studies that compare \"parental\" and \"modified\" mAbs imaged under identical conditions to assess the effects of the cargo itself (e.g. fluorophore, chelator, drug), as well as the chemical conjugation methods. Additionally, we also describe studies that evaluate alternative strategies, including pretargeting, Fc modifications and pre- or co-dosing strategies that seek to tune the biodistribution of a given conjugate. Overall, we highlight the critical role of imaging in characterizing the in vivo performance of mAb conjugates, underscoring how these insights can inform both therapeutic efficacy and toxicity, and enable clinical translation.",

To overcome the persistent limitations of low quantum yield in near-infrared-II (NIR-II) organic dyes, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogen, TPE-Hexoxyl, has been strategically designed. By synergistically suppressing \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and minimizing intramolecular charge transfer, we engineered NIR-II nanoparticles that rank among the brightest organic probes reported (absolute \u03a6<sub>PL</sub> = 0.9%). In vitro studies demonstrated that TPE-Hexoxyl nanoparticles exhibit exceptional colloidal stability and remarkable photostability. In vivo imaging displayed its high spatial resolution and prolonged tissue retention, enabling dynamic high-contrast visualization of systemic vasculature, cerebral microvasculature, and lymphatic networks. Remarkably, TPE-Hexoxyl nanoparticles show superior sensitivity in detecting tumor lesions in orthotopic 4T1 tumor-bearing mice models and achieve precise spatial mapping of inflammatory regions in inflammatory bowel disease models, underscoring their transformative potential for clinical pathological diagnostics. This work establishes a molecular modulation paradigm for designing high-brightness organic NIR-II fluorophores, providing an advanced molecular tool for further clinical diagnostic applications.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objectives</h4>To examine anatomical variants of meniscal root insertions among asymptomatic individuals using high-resolution 7-T MRI.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This prospective study, approved by the local ethics committee, involved 57 knees from 48 participants (mean age 31.8 years; 19 females), being examined on a clinical 7-T MRI scanner with sagittal isotropic 0.24\u2009mm 3D double echo steady state (DESS) sequence. Two radiologists identified the number and location of each meniscal root insertion. Two other radiologists repeated this evaluation, noting meniscofemoral ligaments. Inter-rater reliability was calculated.<h4>Results</h4>Majority of the posterior lateral meniscus roots featured double insertions (66.7%), followed by single (31.6%) and triple insertions (1.8%). Single roots mainly inserted into the intercondylar area (77.8%), the remaining into the posterior slope of the posteromedial eminence (22.2%). Double roots typically had a major insertion at the posteromedial aspect of the anterior cruciate ligament and a minor root at the posterior slope of the lateral eminence (78.9%). The remaining roots of both menisci featured only single insertions. Anterior medial roots inserted along the medial tibial edge (71.9%) and into the intercondylar area (28.1%). Inter-rater reliability for describing the posterior lateral meniscal root insertions was perfect (\u03ba\u2009=\u20091), and strong for identifying all insertion sites (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.808). Meniscofemoral ligaments were prevalent (87.7%) with a broad heterogenous fan-shaped femoral attachment observed using the 3D DESS sequence.<h4>Conclusion</h4>7-T 3D-DESS imaging allows high-resolution visualization of the meniscal roots with excellent inter-rater reliability, highlighting anatomical variability mainly in the posterior root of the lateral meniscus.<h4>Key points</h4>Question Anatomical variations of the number and insertion sites of meniscal roots are documented in anatomical and imaging studies. Findings High-resolution 3D dual-echo steady state on a 7-T MRI facilitates the visualization of the number of roots and their respective osseous insertions for both menisci. Clinical relevance The menisci demonstrate considerable variability in both root number and their insertion locations, particularly the posterior lateral meniscus exhibits up to three root insertions. Understanding anatomical variants is crucial for the accurate interpretation and reporting of knee imaging.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>To develop a mixed reality navigation system based on single-vertebra registration and to preliminarily validate its feasibility in clinical surgery, providing a potential reference for spinal surgical navigation registration methods.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a portable, stand-alone, optical-based mixed reality navigation system for spinal surgery using a head-mounted display. The system integrates registration and real-time localization functions, enabling single-vertebra registration via anatomical landmarks and interactive visualization through the HoloLens\u202f2 platform. System performance was evaluated in both laboratory and clinical settings by measuring localization time, fiducial registration error (FRE), and target registration error (TRE). Preoperative assessments were conducted on patient-specific 3D-printed vertebral models, and intraoperative evaluations were performed on exposed vertebrae during surgery. Additional trials with novice surgeons were performed to assess the learning curve. For selected cases requiring pedicle screw placement, surgeons qualitatively evaluated the intraoperative visualization of preplanned screw trajectories in terms of anatomical congruence, feasibility, and display clarity.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 37 spinal surgery patients were included, covering cervical, thoracic, and lumbar segments. The average preoperative navigation time based on 3D-printed models was 2.96\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26\u00a0min, compared with 3.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u00a0min intraoperatively (p\u2009=\u20090.002). The FRE was 1.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54\u00a0mm preoperatively and 1.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52\u00a0mm intraoperatively (p\u2009=\u20090.178). The TRE was 1.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.56\u00a0mm preoperatively and 1.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.61\u00a0mm intraoperatively (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Among four pedicle screw placement cases, three were rated satisfactory intraoperatively, and one showed an approximately 5\u00a0mm deviation due to minor patient positional changes. The learning curve indicated that procedure time stabilized at approximately 2.7\u00a0min after about 15 practice cases.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The single-vertebra registration-based mixed reality navigation system enables rapid and accurate vertebral localization in both preoperative and intraoperative settings, with TREs within clinically acceptable limits. The system is portable, easy to operate, and provides an intuitive, immersive navigation interface without relying on external tracking devices. These features suggest its potential as a cost-effective and versatile tool for spinal surgery navigation.",

      "abstractText": "Laryngeal ultrasonography (LUS) is a modern evolution of ultrasound technology that has advanced considerably since its clinical introduction in the 1970s, offering a noninvasive, radiation-free, and cost-effective imaging technique that is gaining renewed attention for its clinical applications in otolaryngology. Although available for decades, LUS remains underused in routine practice. This contemporary review synthesizes recent advances across five domains: tumor and lesion detection, vocal fold (VF) imaging, swallowing assessment, perioperative and emergency airway evaluation, and pediatric applications. Evidence shows that LUS achieves diagnostic accuracy comparable to computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and flexible laryngoscopy for many laryngeal disorders, while offering advantages in accessibility, bedside use, and patient comfort. Studies confirm its high sensitivity and specificity for VF immobility, and show that LUS can provide quantitative markers of dysphagia. In perioperative and emergency care, LUS supports airway screening, intubation confirmation, and postoperative monitoring. In children, it is especially valuable as a safe, noninvasive, and well-tolerated alternative to endoscopy for assessing VF mobility and nodules. Limitations include reduced visualization in calcified cartilage or obesity, signal attenuation with increasing depth, operator dependence, and incomplete evaluation of the oral and esophageal phases of swallowing. Despite these challenges, technological refinements and growing clinical experience continue to broaden its role. LUS is a versatile imaging tool with the potential to complement, and in selected cases replace, more invasive or resource-intensive methods in otolaryngology.",

      "abstractText": "In modern precision agriculture, early and accurate identification of crop diseases is crucial for reducing yield loss and minimizing pesticide overuse. This study proposes an IoT-enabled framework that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with image processing techniques for automated classification and quantification of diseases in rice and potato crops. A custom-curated dataset was developed, comprising over 1,800 images acquired through smartphone cameras and foldscope devices under natural lighting conditions. The proposed CNN model achieved a classification accuracy of over 95%, with a disease quantification accuracy of 90.5%, calculated using pixel-level segmentation of infected regions. Experimental results revealed infection percentages ranging from 0.68% in early-stage cases to 13.98% in severely affected samples, enabling precise disease severity analysis. The framework includes a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time visualization of classification results and severity scores. Training convergence was demonstrated with a mini-batch loss reduction from 1.0879 to 0.0094 over 200 iterations, and classification confidence scores exceeding 90% for most disease categories. In addition to software implementation, the model was synthesized for hardware deployment using FPGA, demonstrating less than 5% LUT and 1% register usage for 512\u2009\u00d7\u2009512 images, ensuring resource-efficient performance in IoT environments. This work introduces a scalable, field-deployable tool for crop health monitoring, with potential to enhance sustainable farming practices through timely disease management.",

      "abstractText": "Partial volume effect (PVE) arises from the limited spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, causing significant quantitative biases that hinder accurate metabolic activity assessment. To address these problems, we proposed an unsupervised deep residual compensation model (U-DRCM) for PET partial volume correction (PVC). U-DRCM first predicted an initial blur kernel for the PVE-affected PET image based on a conditional blind deconvolution module (CBD module). Then, a conditional residual compensation module (CRC module) was introduced to compensate for the error caused by inaccurate blur kernel prediction. The whole model is unsupervised which only needs a single patient's PET image as the training label and the corresponding MR image as the network input. The performance of U-DRCM was evaluated against several established PVC approaches, including Richardson-Lucy (RL), reblurred Van-Cittert (RVC), iterative Yang (IY), neural blind deconvolution (NBD), and deep convolutional neural network (DeepPVC) using both simulated BrainWeb phantom and real clinical datasets. In the simulation study, U-DRCM consistently outperformed competing methods across multiple quantitative metrics, achieved a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), an improved structural similarity index (SSIM), and a lower root mean square error (RMSE). For the real clinical study, U-DRCM delivered substantial improvements in standardized uptake value (SUV) and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) across various brain volumes of interest (VOIs). Experimental results show that U-DRCM effectively mitigates the impact of PVE, resulting in high-quality PVC PET images with enhanced brain visualization.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aimed to develop a deep learning model, capable of extracting both spatial and temporal features from contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) data and integrating with patient clinical parameters, for the differential diagnosis between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed the CEUS data (ultrasound contrast agent: SonoVue\u00ae-sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles) from 165 ICC patients and 140 date-matched HCC patients. A deep learning model, namely CEUS-CD-Net, was developed to extract spatial-temporal features from dynamic CEUS data and integrate them with patient clinical parameters for the differential diagnosis between HCC and ICC. The performance of CEUS-CD-Net was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with comparisons against other methods including the single-source data-based models (CEUS-Net and CD-Net, based merely on dynamic CEUS or patient clinical data), CEUS static image-based model (sCEUS-Net), time-intensity curve-based model (TIC-Model), and the assessment by radiologists.<h4>Results</h4>CEUS-CD-Net achieved an AUC of 0.884 (95% CI, 0.794-0.938) on the test cohort, significantly outperforming the single-source data-based models of CEUS-Net (0.827 [0.730-0.896]) and CD-Net (0.812 [0.718-0.887]), as well as sCEUS-Net (0.772 [0.669-0.851]) and TIC-Model (0.731 [0.633-0.823]). In the subset of determinate cases, CEUS-CD-Net achieved an AUC of 0.893 [0.806-0.950], which was better than the one obtained by radiologists' assessment (0.790 [0.683-0.868]). Model visualization results revealed that CEUS-CD-Net surpassed radiologists in discerning subtle patterns reflected by CEUS.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The integration of spatial and temporal features of dynamic CEUS data, coupled with clinical parameters of patients in CEUS-CD-Net, significantly improved the differential diagnosis between HCC and ICC.",

      "abstractText": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by heterogeneous manifestations with significant morbidities. Diagnosing and managing CD remains challenging due to its variable clinical presentation, complexities in assessing disease extent and activity, and lack of a definitive diagnostic marker. Over the last years, there has been a switch towards a treat-to-target approach in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Capsule endoscopy (CE) has emerged as a non-invasive, complementary tool for CD diagnosis and monitoring. CE is patient friendly being wireless and enables direct visualization of the entire small bowel in one sitting. CE plays a role in the diagnostic workup of suspected CD and in cases of in IBD unclassified (IBDU). In established CD, CE plays a role in monitoring mucosal healing, a key therapeutic target linked to improved long-term outcomes. CE findings significantly influence treatment strategies, leading to therapy escalation, adjustment, or avoidance of unnecessary surgical interventions. Moreover, CE disease activity assessment by means of the Lewis score is able to predict disease flares, thus having also a prognostic role. In conclusion, the non-invasive nature of CE, combined with its diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications, establishes it as an essential tool in the comprehensive management of CD across all disease stages. This review provides a comprehensive update on CE's evolving role in optimizing care of patients with CD.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>In multiple myeloma, progression within 24 months (POD24) is a strong adverse prognostic factor. However, its impact on overall survival (OS) remains underexplored through machine learning.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively collected clinical data from 155 patients and divided them into POD24 and non-POD24 groups. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, univariate Cox regression, and multivariate Cox regression. We further evaluated the effect of these variables on overall survival using ten machine-learning algorithms.<h4>Results</h4>KM and Cox regression analyses revealed significantly poorer OS in the POD24 group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Among machine learning models, ANN achieved the best performance in the test set. PCA-based visualization showed clear class separation and prediction consistency with original feature distributions. SHAP analysis identified POD24 as the strongest model-derived predictor in this cohort of mortality. Force plots further demonstrated that non-POD24 substantially contributed to lower predicted death risk.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study suggests that POD24 may be associated to the survival outcomes in multiple myeloma using both traditional statistical and machine learning approaches. Our findings highlight the potential value of POD24 in mortality risk prediction and demonstrate the utilization of ANN-based SHAP interpretation in enhancing model transparency.",

      "abstractText": "Gastric ulcers in pigs are a major health issue, reducing productivity and welfare. Colonization of the gastric mucosa by Helicobacter spp., particularly Helicobacter suis, is considered a potential etiological factor. This study evaluated the prevalence of gastric lesions and compared three diagnostic methods -impression cytology, urease test, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time PCR) for detecting Helicobacter spp. in pigs. Post mortem samples were collected from 137 slaughtered pigs, with three mucosal samples per stomach (fundus, pylorus, pars oesophagea), totaling 411. A subset of 20 samples, representing all stomach regions and diverse cytology/urease outcomes, was analyzed by Real-Time PCR targeting H. suis and H. pylori (ureA and 16\u00a0S rRNA genes). Macroscopic evaluation frequently revealed ulcerative or pre-ulcerative changes. The highest detection rates occurred in the fundic region (66% by cytology; 45% by urease test), supporting preferential colonization of glandular mucosa. Bacterial presence was also observed in the pars oesophagea, suggesting colonization varies with anatomical site and lesion severity. Real-Time PCR detected H. suis in 80% and H. pylori in 20% of samples, confirming its superior sensitivity and ability to differentiate species, which conventional tests cannot provide. Cytology enabled direct visualization of spiral-shaped bacteria, while the urease test was useful mainly at higher bacterial loads. In conclusion, combining macroscopic scoring with cytology, urease testing, and PCR allows comprehensive assessment of gastric lesions and Helicobacter infection. These results highlight the diagnostic advantages of molecular methods and the value of integrated approaches for surveillance and management of gastric disease in swine production.",

      "abstractText": "Cancer remains among the most common causes of mortality and morbidity globally. For millennia, people have utilized herbal medicine for the treatment of various illnesses, including cancer. Multiple research investigations have demonstrated that Withania somnifera possesses significant anti-cancer potential by targeting multiple cancer signalling pathways. Currently, many articles are published regarding Withania somnifera as an anti-cancer agent; however, no SCOPUS-based bibliometric study encompassing a critical analysis of research trends on the subject has been conducted thus far. This review study provides a concise overview of 272 articles published between 2000 and 2024, focusing on research trends and bibliometric studies of anti-cancer properties of Withania somnifera. The article is structured into two main sections. The first section explores global trends, performance analysis metrics, and citation-related metrics. The final section presents a bibliometric evaluation of the research. Data were retrieved from SCOPUS using specific keywords and then manually curated to eliminate duplicates. VOS viewer (version 1.6.20) and Microsoft Excel 2019 were utilized for data visualization. The output of publications about this subject domain reached its peak in 2024. Academia and industry collaborated to publish 2.20% of the articles. The USA (125), India (112), the Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology at the University of Pittsburgh (25), the Journal of Ethnopharmacology (25), Withania somnifera (124), and Renu Wadhwa (24) were the most prolific entities in terms of country, institution, publisher, keyword, and author. Withaferin A (47) was the most utilized bioactive compound against cancer, particularly breast cancer (15 studies). Despite the advantageous anti-cancer attributes of Withania somnifera, there remains a deficiency in areas such as clinical data, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety and toxicity assessments, and effective formulations, which impedes the progression of this potent natural product into clinical development.",

      "abstractText": "BACKGROUND This report describes a 50-year-old man with large bilateral ureteral stones and hydronephrosis. Bilateral impacted large ureteral stones present significant clinical challenges and can lead to serious complications, such as hydronephrosis, urinary tract infections, and renal function impairment. Due to their size and location, treatment often requires advanced techniques and specialized equipment to achieve optimal outcomes while minimizing complications. In the present case, use of the smallest 6.3-Fr flexible ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy effectively managed the condition, demonstrating its utility in treating complex ureteral stones. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old man received a diagnosis of bilateral impacted ureteral stones. The right ureteral stone measured 22\u00d710\u00d710 mm, and the left stone was 11\u00d710\u00d78 mm, accompanied by hydronephrosis. After antibiotic therapy, flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy was performed using a 6.3-Fr disposable digital flexible ureteroscope. Holmium laser fragmentation was followed by stone fragment retrieval using a vacuum-assisted ureteral access sheath. Postoperative computed tomography confirmed complete stone clearance and significant improvement in hydronephrosis. The patient had an uneventful recovery without significant complications. CONCLUSIONS The 6.3-Fr disposable flexible ureteroscope is highly effective for large impacted ureteral stones. Its small diameter minimizes ureteral trauma, enhances irrigation, and provides superior visualization. The vacuum-assisted ureteral access sheath facilitates efficient stone retrieval, reducing operative time and complications. This case highlights the potential advantages of the 6.3-Fr ureteroscope in treating complex urolithiasis, especially in patients with challenging anatomical conditions. Further studies and clinical trials are needed to validate its broader application and long-term outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate diverse post-transcriptional processes, yet their functional impacts across multiple molecular layers remain incompletely characterized. KnockRBP (https://knockrbp.xu-bioinfo.com) is presented as a comprehensive, multi-omics database systematically cataloging regulatory changes resulting from genetic perturbation of RBPs. The resource integrates 1453 datasets from GEO, ENA, and ENCORE, encompassing RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, microRNA (miRNA)-seq, and 3'RACE-seq across 639 RBPs, 182 cell lines, and 61 diseases. Regulatory outcomes covered include alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, RNA editing, transcript abundance, translation efficiency, and miRNA expression, with all events processed through standardized analytical pipelines and annotated with open reading frame consequences, predicted loss-of-function impacts, and established disease or drug associations. The web interface supports dataset browsing, RBP- and gene-centric multi-omics exploration, transcript structure visualization, and interactive regulatory network navigation, while integrated analytical modules enable prioritization of perturbation-responsive events, cross-layer regulatory inference, and evaluation of clinical relevance. In contrast to existing RBP resources, KnockRBP integrates multi-omics data with perturbation-aware functional annotation, enabling mechanistic investigation and identification of RBP-affected genes and events in post-transcriptional regulation. The database is freely accessible and intended for long-term maintenance, serving as a community resource to advance functional genomics research on RBPs and their roles in human disease.",

This study compares photon-counting-detector CT (PCD-CT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) for detecting small accessory canals in the presence of RC fillings. A phantom model with four bovine teeth containing RC fillings and five artificial accessory canals (1000-200\u00a0\u03bcm) per tooth was embedded in a bovine rib. The phantom was scanned with clinical PCD-CT (ultra-high-resolution protocol) and dental CBCT (endodontic protocol). Canal visibility was evaluated using signal-to-noise criteria, and canal diameters were compared with micro-CT measurements, serving as the reference. Blooming artifacts from RC fillings were quantified using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of attenuation profiles. PCD-CT detected all canals down to 400\u00a0\u03bcm and 81.5% at 200\u00a0\u03bcm, while CBCT reliably detected canals\u2009\u2265\u2009800\u00a0\u03bcm, with detection dropping to 47.2% at 400\u00a0\u03bcm and none at 200\u00a0\u03bcm. Measurement errors for canal diameters were lower with PCD-CT. Artifact widths varied between modalities, with no clear superiority. PCD-CT provided higher detectability and measurement fidelity for small accessory canals in root-filled teeth compared to a dental CBCT, with similar filling-related blooming, supporting the potential of PCD-CT in post-treatment endodontic imaging.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Intraoperative identification of parathyroid adenomas can be challenging due to their anatomical variability and the limitations of preoperative imaging. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging on operative efficiency and surgical outcomes in parathyroidectomy, employing a standard near-infrared (NIR) endoscopic system.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a prospective interventional study with retrospective controls. Patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism were included. The study group received intravenous ICG for intraoperative fluorescence imaging to aid parathyroid gland identification. Standard protocols, including preoperative imaging, intraoperative quick parathyroid hormone (qPTH) measurements, and frozen section analysis, were followed in both groups. Operative times and clinical outcomes were compared between ICG-assisted and standard procedures.<h4>Results</h4>Seventy-six patients were included: 19 in the ICG group and 57 in the control group. The median net operative time (cutting-to-end) was significantly shorter in the ICG group (59 vs. 79\u00a0min; p\u2009=\u20090.002), while entry-to-cutting time was slightly longer (44 vs. 35\u00a0min; p\u2009=\u20090.014). Although the total operative time was shorter in the ICG group (109 vs. 123\u00a0min), this difference was not statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.060). A\u2009\u2265\u200950% reduction in qPTH was achieved in 94.7% vs. 89.5% (p\u2009=\u20090.672), and adenoma confirmation was 100% vs. 96.5% (p\u2009=\u20091.0), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ICG fluorescence is a cost-effective adjunct to standard parathyroidectomy, offering real-time gland visualization and potentially reducing operative times. Its integration into the routine surgical workflow may enhance intraoperative efficiency and outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study is to derive a contrast agent-specific theoretical framework to optimize acquisition parameters for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the physiochemical properties of gadolinium-based contrast agents, focusing on fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences. The goal is to enhance the lesion-to-background contrast for improved diagnostic sensitivity in clinical applications.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Signal equations for fast spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences were derived for nonenhancing and enhancing tissues using gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol, characterized by distinct longitudinal (r 1 ) and transverse (r 2 /r* 2 ) relaxivities. Simulations were conducted at 2 field strengths, 1.5T and 3.0T, and various scenarios were considered, including hypothetical lesions with T 1 ratios ranging from 1.1 to 1.8. The signal behavior was analyzed across a range of initial conditions, including different spin densities and field-strength dependent variations in tissue relaxation times. The optimal flip angle and repetition time combinations were determined to maximize contrast. In vivo validation was performed on 2 patients undergoing contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain, using the proposed acquisition parameters.<h4>Results</h4>The modeling and simulations revealed that the flip angle that maximizes signal intensity for a contrast-enhancing lesion (Ernst angle) differs from the flip angle that maximizes T 1 -dependent contrast between lesion and healthy tissue in unenhanced MRI (Pelc angle) and also differs from the flip angle that maximizes the same in contrast-enhanced MRI. The theoretical simulations indicated possible contrast gains of 24%-28% using optimized parameters. The in vivo acquisitions demonstrated contrast gains of 19%-44% for a diffuse enhancing lesion and 91% for a weakly enhancing focal lesion, when comparing the optimized acquisition parameters to manufacturer's default settings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Adjusted repetition time and flip angle values, derived using the proposed framework, improved the image contrast between healthy and diseased tissues, enhancing the visualization of abnormalities. This approach can be used to optimize routine clinical MRI protocols and balance scan time with contrast enhancement. This may translate to more precise lesion detection, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis or treatment monitoring in clinical practice.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Endodontic microsurgery (EMS) is a widely utilized technique for addressing periapical periodontitis that is unresponsive to conventional root canal treatment. Nevertheless, achieving precise root apex location and resection can pose significant challenges for surgeons, particularly in complex anatomical situations. The inherent difficulties in accessing and the restricted visualization typically render EMS infeasible in the second molar region. The autonomous robotic (ATR) system, characterized by its automation, precision, and stability, is anticipated to address the limitations inherent in manual operations within complex EMS scenarios. Herein, this report details the successful application of robot-assisted EMS in a maxillary second molar.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 26-year-old female patient presented to our hospital with chronic periapical periodontitis following a previous history of root canal treatment in the left maxillary second molar. The patient data were imported into DentalNavi software to design the drilling path for precise resection while avoiding damage to the maxillary sinus. Through the integration of an optical pose tracking mechanism and the computerized operational system, the robotic arm completed the autonomous resection task of the mesiobuccal root according to the preoperative plan, providing a position reference for the freehand operation of the distobuccal root. No complications were reported during the surgery. Clinical and radiographic assessments at a six-month follow-up indicated satisfactory outcomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The ATR system offers an accurate, safe, and minimally invasive technique for osteotomy and apicoectomy. This technology demonstrates potential as a reliable and clinically effective technique for managing complex and anatomically challenging posterior EMS procedures.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The sinus tract has been demonstrated to be a factor affecting the efficacy of periprosthetic joint infection. Reinfection after prosthesis removal and antibiotic bone cement spacer implantation is one of the reasons for the failure of two-stage arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors predicting the reinfection in periprosthetic joint infection with sinus tracts following prosthesis removal and antibiotic bone cement spacer implantation.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical data of 35 periprosthetic joint infection patients with sinus tract from February 2003 to December 2021 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Follow-up was discontinued either (1) when patients developed reinfection before completing the second stage of the two-stage revision or (2) when patients were free of infection 2-years postoperatively, regardless of whether they had completed the two-stage revision. The sinus tract is defined as an abnormal channel with evidence of communication to the joint or visualization of the prosthesis. Postoperative reinfection was defined as meeting the diagnostic criteria for periprosthetic joint infection, including requiring hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics or surgeries to prevent infection. The Multifactor Cox proportional risk model was used to analyze the risk factors.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 35 patients, 14 (40.0%) of periprosthetic joint infection patients with one or more sinus tracts developed reinfection after removal of prostheses and implantation of antibiotic bone cement spacers. Multivariate analysis showed that age (p\u2009=\u20090.044), C-reactive protein (p\u2009=\u20090.023) and uric acid (p\u2009=\u20090.025) were independent risk factors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We found the following factors associated with reinfection in periprosthetic joint infection with sinus tracts following prosthesis removal and antibiotic bone cement spacer implantation: age, C-reactive protein and uric acid.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Myopia has emerged as a significant public health concern in China. Despite age and axial length-to-corneal radius ratio (AL/CR) being widely recognized as independent factors influencing myopia in children and adolescents, very few studies have investigated the combined effects of these two factors or the extent of their interaction. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the association and interaction between age and AL/CR and the prevalence of myopia in children and adolescents, providing evidence for early myopia prevention and control.<h4>Methods</h4>In 2022, three primary schools in Shenzhen were selected via random cluster sampling. Students who had lived in Shenzhen for over 6\u00a0months were administered surveys, and underwent myopia screenings (visual acuity and noncycloplegic autorefraction) and ocular biometric measurements. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the interaction between age and AL/CR using both multiplicative and additive models. A generalized additive model was used to evaluate the relationship among age, AL/CR, and myopia prevalence, with the results presented through visualization analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3,220 participants were included (mean age of 8.95\u2009\u00b1\u20091.77\u00a0years; mean AL/CR ratio of 3.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13). The overall prevalence of myopia was 47.67%. After adjusting for sex, parental myopia, reading and writing posture, per capita monthly income, and anterior chamber depth, a significant multiplicative interaction between age and AL/CR on myopia prevalence (OR\u2009=\u20092.147, 95% CI 1.553-2.968) was observed. Additive interaction analysis further revealed a relative excess risk due to interaction of 10.816 (95% CI 8.027-13.605), an attributable proportion of 0.700 (95% CI 0.636-0.763), and a synergy index of 3.971 (95% CI 3.065-5.143).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The interaction between age and AL/CR was associated with a greater likelihood of myopia, with both positive multiplicative and additive effects observed. Older age and increased AL/CR ratios were associated with a greater likelihood of myopia in children and adolescents, emphasizing the importance of early prevention strategies.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Craniopagus twins pose a unique surgical challenge because of complexity in shared cranial and vascular anatomy. Recent development in technology seems to have potential in assistance in pre-surgical planning, by providing patient-specific physical models of complex anatomy. To date, the application of 3D-printed models for craniopagus twinning separation has not been reported in Saudi Arabia or in the wider Middle East.<h4>Objective</h4>This descriptive study describes the process and establishes the use of 3D-printed anatomical surgical models for the pre-surgical planning of three recent cases of craniopagus twin separation performed at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. These models are the first of their kind in the country and are a major milestone in neurosurgical planning.<h4>Methods</h4>High-resolution MRI and CTA imaging data were collected for three cases of craniopagus twins. The imaging data were segmented and processed to create 3D models of the skull, brain, and shared vasculature using specialized software. Multi-material 3D printing was then employed to produce physical models that accurately represented different anatomical structures, allowing for enhanced distinction and visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Three sets of 3D-printed models were successfully developed. The 3D-printed models provided an accurate and detailed representation of the shared anatomy, allowing the surgical team to visualize and manipulate the complex cranial fusion points and vascular connections. The models were particularly valuable in reducing intraoperative uncertainty and mitigating the risk of complications. This is the first documented use of 3D printing for craniopagus twin separation in Saudi Arabia.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As the first such application in the region, this study paves the way for broader use of 3D printing in complex neurosurgical cases across Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of this technology in enhancing clinical outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "\u00bb Inconsistent terminology and overlapping definitions for posterior distal tibia/ankle fractures (posterior malleolar, pilon-variant, posterior pilon) hinder standardized care and outcomes. This study critically evaluates classifications and treatments, proposing clear definitions based on fragment morphology, articular involvement, and biomechanics:\u00bb 1. Posterior malleolar fractures: Involve the non-weight-bearing posterior tibial margin, typically from rotational injuries. Nonoperative management suffices if the syndesmosis is stable (smaller fragments). In the case of an unstable syndesmosis, surgical fixation by a posterolateral (PL) approach is recommended for direct visualization, reduction, and stable fixation, although this may vary case by case.\u00bb 2. Posterior pilon-variant fractures: Intermediate severity, affecting the posteromedial (PM) tibia and partially compromising the weight-bearing surface. Characterized by large PM fragments. Fixation by a PM approach is recommended, promoting faster union and reducing neurovascular risk compared with PL, although this is ultimately up to the surgeon's preference.\u00bb 3. Posterior pilon fractures: Involve disruption of the weight-bearing articular surface with posterior plafond extension, resulting from high-energy axial compression (e.g., falls). Features include comminution, articular impaction, and potential involvement of posterior/medial columns, resembling classic pilon but posteriorly localized. Severe soft-tissue damage necessitates staged management: initial external fixation followed by definitive internal fixation. Addressing comminuted fragments requires a combined PL and PM approach. For a large fragment with no comminution, minimally invasive anterior cannulated screws can be used.\u00bb This taxonomy directly links fracture patterns to surgical urgency (nonoperative, single-stage, staged), fixation strategies (approach selection-PL, PM, or combined), and prognostic implications. By integrating anatomical precision with clinical practicality, the framework resolves current terminology disparities, enhances diagnostic reproducibility, and aims to improve outcomes for these complex injuries.",

      "abstractText": "To evaluate the impact of sedation on image quality in cardiovascular computed tomography (CCT) in congenital heart disease (CHD). CCT plays an important role in CHD assessment. CCT image quality can be compromised by 'patient-based' artifacts, and sedation is thought to minimize these. \"Optimal\" quality must be carefully considered given the risk of neurodevelopmental delay from cumulative effect of sedation. This was a single-center retrospective study of all consecutive CHD CCT scans performed on pediatric patients (<\u200912\u00a0years). Patients were categorized into three subgroups based on age and four subgroups based on CCT indication. Image analysis was scored by blinded raters using a 4-point Likert scale for image quality, visualization of structure in question, and reporting of elements of diagnosis. Additionally, the raters commented if scan is of diagnostic quality. The study was reported of diagnostic quality if it answered the clinical question. Interobserver analysis was conducted in a subgroup of 100 cases. A total of 291 congenital CCT scans were reviewed, of which 154 met inclusion criteria (age range 0.03-11.6\u00a0years; 63% male), including 83 sedated scans. Diagnostic quality was comparable between sedated and non-sedated scans in the overall cohort (94% vs. 99%, p\u2009=\u20090.2), as well as across age and indication subgroups, despite differences in certain image quality parameters. The mean dose length product (DLP) was 25.1\u2009\u00b1\u200933.6\u00a0mGy\u00b7cm in the sedated group and 24.8\u2009\u00b1\u200936.5\u00a0mGy\u00b7cm in the non-sedated group, with no significant differences across age subgroups (<\u20092\u00a0months: p\u2009=\u20090.2; 2months-4\u00a0years: p\u2009=\u20090.6; 4-12\u00a0years: p\u2009>\u20090.9). Inter-rater reliability analysis demonstrated good to excellent agreement. Our study demonstrates overall high diagnostic quality of CCT in children with CHD, with no significant difference between sedated and non-sedated groups, despite the presence of artifacts. Radiation dose burden was also comparable between the two groups. Future multicenter studies with larger sample sizes and varied scanner platforms are needed to validate and expand upon these findings.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The analgesic efficacy of transmuscular quadratus lumborum block (TQLB) as a means of decreasing the need for opioid use following laparoscopic nephrectomy has been demonstrated in several studies, but the effect of the lower thoracic paravertebral block via posterior pathway of medial arcuate ligament under direct visualization (LTPB-MAL) in this surgical context remains to be clearly elucidated.<h4>Objectives</h4>To juxtapose the pain-relieving potency of the TQLB and the LTPB-MAL in individuals receiving laparoscopic nephrectomy.<h4>Design</h4>A randomized controlled study.<h4>Setting</h4>University-affiliated tertiary care hospital.<h4>Methods</h4>One hundred and two individuals slated for laparoscopic nephrectomy under general anesthesia were assigned to acquire either TQLB or LTPB-MAL by chance, with both groups receiving 25\u00a0ml of 0.5% ropivacaine post-surgery. The primary outcome was the total intravenous morphine equivalent doses consumed within the first day post-operatively. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity; interval to first opioids request; rescue analgesics use; and occurrence of nausea/vomiting; time to first ambulation; hospital duration and satisfaction scores.<h4>Results</h4>The patients receiving LTPB-MAL consumed significantly less intravenous morphine equivalent doses than those receiving TQLB in the first 24\u00a0h after surgery, with a mean (SD) of 23.5 (7.6) mg versus 33.6 (10.2) mg, P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively. Time to the first opioid request in the LTPB-MAL group was significantly prolonged compared with the TQLB group, P\u2009<\u20090.001. No considerable discrepancy was observed in pain intensity, rescue pain consumption, satisfaction scores, incidence of nausea or vomiting, or ambulation and length of hospital stay within the two groups.<h4>Conclusion</h4>LTPB-MAL significantly reduces postoperative opioids usage in the first 24\u00a0h after surgery and delays the initial opioid request, endorsing it as an enhanced strategy for multimodal analgesia in laparoscopic nephrectomy.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The Ethics Committee of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital granted ethical approval for our study protocol on May 10, 2022 (2022-ke-447). The study was officially registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200060507) on June 3, 2022.",

In this ex- vivo study, we utilized a phantom heart model to simulate physiological attenuation and imitated the most common coronary bifurcation stenting techniques by creating multiple stent layers and stent- crush situations (single layer, crushed, two\u2011 and three\u2011layer). We compared UHR and SR PCD\u2011CT using Bv72 and Bv56 kernels. Objective endpoints were in\u2011stent lumen visibility, signal-to-noise ratio, and percentage change in stent attenuation; subjective image quality was rated on a 5\u2011point Likert scale (1 = excellent to 5 = non\u2011diagnostic). Depending on distribution, two\u2011sided t\u2011tests (mean \u00b1 SD) or Mann-Whitney U tests (median[IQR]) were applied, p\u2011values were Bonferroni\u2011corrected for multiple comparisons. In the pooled Crush cohort, UHR Bv72 improved in\u2011stent lumen visibility when compared with both, SR Bv72 (single-layer: 68.08 \u00b1 4.30% vs. 79.03 \u00b1 3.79%; crushed: 63.62 \u00b1 4.97% vs. 74.73 \u00b1 2.51%) and SR Bv56 (single-layer: 63.63 \u00b1 4.47% vs. 79.03 \u00b1 3.79%; crushed: 62.18 \u00b1 3.55% vs. 74.73 \u00b1 2.51%), all p < 0.01. The effect was even more pronounced in small stents (single\u2011layer 65.45 \u00b1 1.91% (SR) vs. 77.11 \u00b1 2.55% (UHR) and crushed 60.67 \u00b1 2.67% vs. 74.00 \u00b1 2.67%), both p < 0.01. Regarding subjective image quality, UHR was associated with better sharpness and less blooming, e.g., UHR Bv72 vs. SR Bv56 (multilayer: sharpness 1[0] vs. 2[0], blooming 1[0] vs. 2[0]; crush: sharpness 1[0] vs. 2[0], blooming 1[0] vs. 2[1]; all p \u2264 0.01) and UHR Bv72 vs. SR Bv72 (multilayer: sharpness 1[0] vs. 1[1], blooming 1[0] vs. 1[1]; crush: sharpness 1[0] vs. 1[1]; all p \u2264 0.05). These findings indicate that UHR PCD\u2011CT with Bv72 might enable assessment of complex stents in a phantom setting; even though clinical studies are warranted.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Preclinical studies have demonstrated that [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga/[<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04, a bivalent agent containing an extra hypoxia-sensitive 2-nitroimidazole (NI) group, exhibited favorable tumor binding affinity and improved tumor uptake and retention than [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga/[<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-DOTA-FAPI-04. This study aims to further investigate the value of clinical application for [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 PET/CT via a direct head-to-head comparison with [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 50 patients underwent paired [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT within 1 week interval. Among these, four patients underwent serial dynamic [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 PET scans for dosimetry evaluation, and the others underwent scans at 60\u00a0min and 120\u00a0min. Additionally, we calculated the SUV<sub>max</sub> differences (\u0394SUV<sub>max</sub>) by [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 minus [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT for further analysis. Immunohistochemistry for FAP and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) was performed in 22 primary tumors.<h4>Results</h4>The effective absorbed dose of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 PET/CT was calculated as 1.95E-02 mSv/MBq. Tumor uptake of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 showed rapid uptake and steady values (average SUV<sub>max</sub> 11.6-13.0 from 3 to 120\u00a0min). [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 exhibited significantly higher uptake in tumor lesions compared to [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT, particularly in primary tumors (P\u2009<\u20090.05), nodal metastases (P\u2009<\u20090.001), bone metastases (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and liver metastases (P\u2009<\u20090.05). That of FAP expression was correlated with that of HIF-1\u03b1 (r\u2009=\u20090.661, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 showed a positive correlation with \u0394SUV<sub>max</sub> (r\u2009=\u20090.528, P\u2009=\u20090.011).<h4>Conclusion</h4>[<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 showed significantly higher tumor uptake and retention over [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04, with particularly enhanced visualization of hypoxic lesions, suggesting that hypoxia-sensitive moiety may play an important role in detection of tumors. Further study of [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-DOTA-NI-FAPI-04 in humans is warranted to explore its clinical applications.
