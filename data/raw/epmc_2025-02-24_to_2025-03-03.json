      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Participant recruitment and retention are critical to the success of clinical trials, yet challenges such as low enrollment rates and high attrition remain ongoing obstacles. RecruitGPS is a scalable dashboard with integrated control charts to address these issues by providing real-time data monitoring and analysis, enabling researchers to better track and improve recruitment and retention.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to identify the challenges and inefficiencies users encounter when interacting with the RecruitGPS dashboard. By identifying these issues, the study aims to inform strategies for improving the dashboard's user interface and create targeted, effective instructional materials that address user needs.<h4>Methods</h4>Twelve clinical researchers from the Midwest region of the United States provided feedback through a 10-minute, video-recorded usability test session, during which participants were instructed to explore the various tabs of the dashboard, identify challenges, and note features that worked well while thinking aloud. Following the video session, participants took a survey on which they answered System Usability Scale (SUS) questions, ease of navigation questions, and a Net Promoter Score (NPS) question.<h4>Results</h4>A quantitative analysis of survey responses revealed an average SUS score of 61.46 (SD 23.80; median 66.25) points, indicating a need for improvement in the user interface. The NPS was 8, with 4 of 12 (33%) respondents classified as promoters and 3 of 12 (25%) as detractors, indicating a slightly positive satisfaction. When participants compared RecruitGPS to other recruitment and study management tools they had used, 8 of 12 (67%) of participants rated RecruitGPS as better or much better. Only 1 of 12 (8%) participants rated RecruitGPS as worse but not much worse. A qualitative analysis of participants' interactions with the dashboard diagnosed a confusing part of the dashboard that could be eliminated or made optional and provided valuable insight for the development of instructional videos and documentation. Participants liked the dashboard's data visualization capabilities, including intuitive graphs and trend tracking; progress indicators, such as color-coded status indicators and comparison metrics; and the overall dashboard's layout and design, which consolidated relevant data on a single page. Users also valued the accuracy and real-time updates of data, especially the integration with external sources like Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).<h4>Conclusions</h4>RecruitGPS demonstrates significant potential to improve the efficiency of clinical trials by providing researchers with real-time insights into participant recruitment and retention. This study offers valuable recommendations for targeted refinements to enhance the user experience and maximize the dashboard's effectiveness. Additionally, it highlights navigation challenges that can be addressed through the development of clear and focused instructional videos.",

Herein we present a tactile visual synapse that enables in situ monitoring of finger rehabilitation and electrocardiogram analysis. Repetitive finger flexion and various arrhythmias are monitored and visually guided using the developed tactile visual synapse combined with an electrical and optical output feedback algorithm. The tactile visual synapse has the structure of an electrochemical transistor comprising an elastomeric top gate as a tactile receptor and an electrochemiluminescent ion gel as a light-emitting layer stacked on a polymeric semiconductor layer, forming an electrical synaptic channel between source and drain electrodes. The low-power (~34\u2009\u03bcW) visualization of the tactile synaptic activity associated with the repetitive motions of fingers and heartbeats enables the development of a convenient and efficient personalized healthcare system.",

      "abstractText": "Tuberculosis (TB) treatment non-compliance remains a significant global public health issue, undermining disease control efforts and leading to adverse clinical and epidemiological outcomes. While considerable research has explored this issue, gaps remain in understanding the multifactorial influences on non-compliance, particularly its key factors and impacts, as well as the interconnections that exacerbate these challenges. This study integrates narrative and bibliometric approaches to critically synthesize and visualize factors contributing to TB treatment non-compliance and its impacts. By addressing research gaps, this study aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the multifactorial challenges and proposing evidence-informed strategies to address clinical and epidemiological issues. A systematic search of Scopus, EBSCO (Medline), ScienceDirect, and PubMed databases identified empirical studies published up to December 2024. Thematic synthesis categorized factors into overarching themes, while bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software visualized factors and their interconnections. The review identified key factors such as poor tuberculosis knowledge, stigma, side effects, and economic constraints, interacting with demographic, psychological, and systemic barriers. Network visualization highlighted the interconnections among these factors, illustrating how they compound to exacerbate non-compliance. Clinical and epidemiological impacts include MDR/XDR-TB, prolonged treatment, and community transmission. TB treatment non-compliance arises from a complex interplay of individual, socio-economic, and healthcare-related factors. This review emphasizes the importance of integrated narrative and bibliometric approaches to develop context-specific strategies for improving adherence, reducing the global TB burden, and guiding future research and policy.",

      "abstractText": "The study introduces a clinical decision support system (CDSS) developed at a single academic cancer center, integrating real-time clinical, genomic, and imaging data for over 170,000 patients across 11 cancer types. We have developed the Yonsei Cancer Data Library (YCDL) data integration framework to continuously collect and update multimodal datasets comprising over 800 features per case. Quality control measures, using 143 logical comparisons, addressed missing data and outliers, achieving median accuracies of 92.6% for surgical and 98.7% for molecular pathology. An Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process with natural language processing transformed unstructured data, enabling survival analyses stratified by tumor stage, which revealed significant stage-dependent differences. The CDSS dashboard visualizes patient trajectories and key milestones. User feedback from oncology professionals showed strong acceptance, with satisfaction scores exceeding 4 out of 5. This framework demonstrates the potential of multimodal data integration to enhance clinical decision-making and patient outcomes, with future research needed to validate its generalizability and scalability.",

This quality improvement project aimed to increase the rate of timely and safe oxygen delivery from 30% to 75% at Wallaga University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from 1 January to 30 June 2024.Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, the project team identified root causes through fishbone and driver diagrams. Key interventions included staff orientation on safe handling of oxygen devices, clear job descriptions for compliance, improved handover processes between shifts, regular maintenance and inventory checks, increasing the number of oxygen cylinders, using hospital vehicles for transport and establishing a communication system with suppliers for timely requests.Results showed that the inventory of regular oxygen delivery devices improved to 76%, with equipment checks conducted 65% of the time. Emergency preparedness reached 20%, and onsite training for staff achieved 75%. Oxygen usage monitoring was nearly perfect at 99%, with delivery times reduced to 1\u2009day for 70% of orders. A standard protocol for oxygen supply and use was established, resulting in a significant increase in timely and safe oxygen delivery from 30% to 75%.This project effectively optimised oxygen supply management, highlighting the importance of proactive management, communication and continuous monitoring in building a reliable oxygen therapy service. Improvements in inventory management and delivery efficiency were facilitated by a dedicated dashboard, standardised operating procedures and comprehensive staff training.",

      "abstractText": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with the potential to disrupt cancer detection, diagnosis and treatment. However, the development of new AI algorithms requires access to large and complex real-world datasets. Although such datasets are constantly being generated, access to them is limited by data fragmentation across numerous repositories and sites, heterogeneity, lack of annotations, and potential privacy issues. The European Cancer Imaging Initiative is a flagship of Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, aiming to unlock the power of AI for cancer patients, clinicians, and researchers by establishing a federated European infrastructure for cancer images through the EU-funded EUropean Federation for CAncer IMages (EUCAIM) project. This infrastructure, called Cancer Image Europe, builds on the AI for Health Imaging network (AI4HI), established European Research Infrastructures (Euro-BioImaging, BBMRI-ERIC, EATRIS, ECRIN, and ELIXIR), and numerous related partners providing access to research tools, images, and related clinical, pathology and molecular data. The infrastructure targets clinicians, researchers, and innovators by providing the means to develop and validate data-intensive AI-based and other IT-enabled clinical decision-making systems supporting precision medicine. Common data models, including a linking hyperontology, quality standards, compliance with the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) principles, data annotation, curation and anonymization services are provided to ensure data quality and interoperability, consistency and privacy. In summer 2024, the EUCAIM project released the first prototype of an EU-wide infrastructure, with a comprehensive dashboard integrating applications for dataset discovery, federated search, data access request, metadata harvesting, annotation, secure processing environments and federated processing. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: EUCAIM's federated infrastructure for cancer image data advances medical research and related AI development in Europe. It addresses the current fragmentation and heterogeneity of data repositories is legally compliant, and facilitates collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and innovators. KEY POINTS: AI solutions to advance cancer care rely on large, high-quality real-world datasets. EUCAIM's federated infrastructure for cancer image data empowers cancer research in Europe. It provides access to research tools, images, and related clinical, pathology and molecular data.",

In this multicenter study, 4569 cases were included for framework development, and data from seven hospitals were employed for diagnostic validation. TNVis achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.90 after internal testing. For the external validation, TNVis significantly improved radiologists' performance, reaching an AUC of 0.79, compared to their diagnostic performance without the use of TNVis (AUC: 0.66; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and those with partial assistance (AUC: 0.72; p\u2009<\u20090.001). In conclusion, the TNVis-assisted diagnostic strategy not only significantly improves the diagnostic ability of radiologists but also closely imitates their clinical diagnostic procedures and provides them with an objective 3D representation of the nodules for precise and personalized diagnosis and treatment planning.",

This study describes the steps for performing a TMJ arthroscopy technique in the inferior joint space, using anatomical and numerical references. It consists of three steps: marking the reference points, entering the inferior joint space with the cannula, and inserting a needle for continuous Ringer solution irrigation. The precision of this new technique allows greater reproducibility and safety in clinical application.",

While numerous ML models for flow cytometry data have been proposed, few studies have described the clinical deployment of such models. Realizing the potential gains of ML models in clinical labs requires not only an accurate model but also infrastructure for automated inference, error detection, analytics and monitoring, and structured data extraction. Here, we describe an ML model for the detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), along with the infrastructure supporting clinical implementation. Our infrastructure leverages the resilience and scalability of the cloud for model inference, a Kubernetes-based workflow system that provides model reproducibility and resource management, and a system for extracting structured diagnoses from full-text reports. We also describe our model monitoring and visualization platform, an essential element for ensuring continued model accuracy. Finally, we present a post-deployment analysis of impacts on turn-around time and compare production accuracy to the original validation statistics.",

Additionally, we introduce a label to represent segments of the signal infected by noise. The data was collected simultaneously using different types of sensors: a tensometer and two accelerometers. The datasets have been made publicly available via the Gdansk University of Technology repository \"Most Wiedzy\", ensuring open access to the data and reproducibility of research on respiratory classification. Along with the data we also publish the source files of tools used for building the datasets as well as our implementation of the models for respiratory rate classification and visualization. The data have been stored in CSV format and organized through a directory structure according to different breath patterns. These datasets can be easily processed and converted for usage with different machine learning methods across various research applications in respiratory health.",

Antifibrotic treatments modify only the rate of fibrosis progression, and more effective therapies are urgently needed. Molecular imaging enables visualization of disease pathogenesis in progress. It provides a noninvasive means to monitor and quantify dysregulated molecular fibrotic pathways and shows great promise in aiding the diagnosis and disease activity monitoring of pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we review molecular imaging probes under development for use in pulmonary fibrosis. We provide our opinion on current challenges in translating preclinical molecular imaging probes into clinical successes, as well as future directions for expanding their use in drug development.",

This study used the SEER database to investigate if PTR improves prognosis in CRLM patients and developed a nomogram to predict the likelihood of benefiting from PTR. Patients with CRLM from the SEER database (2010-2019) were included. Propensity score matching (PSM) balanced PTR and non-PTR groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis compared overall and cancer-specific survival. Cox regression identified survival factors. The PTR group was divided into training and validation sets (7:3 ratio) for nomogram development using logistic regression. Nomogram performance was validated using ROC curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. A total of 3264 CRLM patients were included (2459 with PTR, 805 without). After 1:1 PSM, each group had 484 patients. PTR significantly improved survival (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Logistic regression identified age, race, T-stage, chemotherapy, and metastases to the liver, brain, and bone as risk factors. The nomogram showed excellent predictive performance and clinical utility. PTR improves survival in CRLM patients, and the nomogram effectively predicts the benefit of PTR.",

      "abstractText": "The standard Patlak plot, a simple yet efficient model, is widely used to describe irreversible tracer kinetics for dynamic PET imaging. Its widespread application to whole-body parametric imaging remains constrained because of the need for a full-time-course input function (e.g., 1 h). In this paper, we demonstrate the relative Patlak (RP) plot, which eliminates the need for the early-time input function, for total-body parametric imaging and its application to 20-min clinical scans acquired in list mode. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a theoretic analysis to indicate that the RP intercept <i>b</i>' is equivalent to a ratio of the SUV relative to the plasma concentration, whereas the RP slope <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> ' is equal to the standard Patlak <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> (net influx rate) multiplied by a global scaling factor for each subject. One challenge in applying RP to a short scan duration (e.g., 20 min) is the resulting high noise in the parametric images. We applied a self-supervised deep-kernel method for noise reduction. Using the standard Patlak plot as the reference, the RP method was evaluated for lesion quantification, lesion-to-background contrast, and myocardial visualization in total-body parametric imaging in 22 human subjects (12 healthy subjects and 10 cancer patients) who underwent a 1-h dynamic <sup>18</sup>F-FDG scan. The RP method was also applied to the dynamic data reconstructed from a clinical standard 20-min list-mode scan either at 1 or 2 h after injection for 2 cancer patients. <b>Results:</b> We demonstrated that it is feasible to obtain high-quality parametric images from 20-min scans using RP parametric imaging with a self-supervised deep-kernel noise-reduction strategy. The RP slope <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> ' was highly correlated with the standard Patlak <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> in lesions and major organs, demonstrating its quantitative potential across subjects. Compared with conventional SUVs, the <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> ' images significantly improved lesion contrast and enabled visualization of the myocardium for potential cardiac assessment. The application of the RP parametric imaging to the 2 clinical scans also showed similar benefits. <b>Conclusion:</b> Using total-body PET with the RP approach, it is feasible to generate parametric images using data from a 20-min clinical list-mode scan.",

      "abstractText": "With the intensification of aging issues, inflammatory orthopedic diseases almost occur in the majority of elderly people, which is becoming increasingly severe. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive visualization technique for a clear diagnosis of the inflammation areas through detecting acoustic signals generated by the laser irradiation. The combination of \"light input\" and \"acoustic output\" provides unprecedented scalability as well as high penetration depth and resolution. This new imaging technology can also present more anatomical information and feedback status of inflammatory activity for the orthopedic diseases. Especially in inflammation imaging, this technology can effectively supplement current clinical imaging methods in diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of pathophysiological processes. With the rapid development of these new technologies, the goals of precise diagnosis, predictive regulation, and ultimately personalized treatment strategies are becoming increasingly realistic. Herein, this article introduces various orthopedic inflammations and related imaging technology applications. It covers the types of PA nanoprobes and their research progress in orthopedic inflammation, as well as the potential applications of PAI in various aspects. The review also discusses the recent researches and emerging translational applications of PAI in orthopedic inflammation, as well as the prospects and future development challenges of clinical transformation.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Mobile health (mHealth) apps provide easy and quick access for end users to monitor their health-related activities. Features such as medication reminders help end users adhere to their medication schedules and automatically record these actions, thereby helping manage their overall health. Due to insufficient mHealth tools tailored for HIV preventive care in young men who have sex with men (MSM), our study evaluated the usability of the mChoice app, a tool designed to enhance preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence and promote sexual health (eg, encouraging the use of condoms and being aware of the partner's HIV status and PrEP use).<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to apply systematic usability evaluations to test the mChoice app and to refine the visualizations to better capture and display patient-reported health information.<h4>Methods</h4>Usability testing involved heuristic evaluations conducted with 5 experts in informatics and user testing with 20 young MSM who were taking or were eligible to take PrEP.<h4>Results</h4>End users demonstrated satisfaction with the appearance of the mChoice app, reporting that the app has an intuitive interface to track PrEP adherence. However, participants highlighted areas needing improvement, including chart titles and the inclusion of \"undo\" and \"edit\" buttons to improve user control when recording PrEP use.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Usability evaluations involving heuristic experts and end users provided valuable insights into the mChoice app's design. Areas for improvement were identified, such as enhancing chart readability and providing additional user controls. These findings will guide iterative refinements, ensuring that future versions of the app better address the needs of its target audience and effectively support HIV prevention.",

      "abstractText": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections remain a significant public health burden globally with infected individuals at high risk for cognitive decline and memory loss even on combination antiretroviral therapy. Almost half of HIV infected individuals smoke, which drives poorer health outcomes including a higher dementia rate. Microglia are the brain's immune cells that serve as a persistent HIV reservoir contributing to neuroinflammatory signaling. We examined interactions between the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 and nicotine within human microglia cells (HMC3) that endogenously express chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) shows that gp120 alters mitochondria proteins within HMC3 cells. In the presence of nicotine, gp120 increased the expression of mitochondrial prohibitin 2 (PHB2), cytochrome c (cyt c), and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) but decreased fission 1 (FIS1) levels. An analysis of mito-YFP expression confirms that interaction between nicotine and gp120 increases the size and branching of mitochondrial networks. Interaction between nicotine and gp120 is also surprisingly found to promote the release of amyloid precursor protein (APP) peptides from microglia. This was accompanied by visualization of amyloid containing vesicles that colocalized with the autophagy protein LC3B-II in the cell. Taken together, our findings show that interaction between nicotine and gp120 impact microglia in a manner that regulates mitochondrial proteins and network properties and impacts amyloid protein management and release within microglia. These mechanisms may contribute to understanding neuroinflammatory signaling in smokers with HIV.",

      "abstractText": "Traditional open lumbar decompression techniques have long been used to relieve spinal canal pressure caused by lumbar spinal stenosis. However, these procedures are associated with significant postoperative pain and prolonged recovery. Over the past few decades, there has been a shift toward minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques designed to minimize tissue trauma, postoperative pain, and recovery time. These advancements represent a major step forward, offering smaller incisions and direct visualization of the spinal canal. Despite the clear benefits of MIS and endoscopic techniques, they also present challenges such as a steep learning curve for surgeons and a risk of incomplete decompression. The present review examines the historical progression from open to MIS and endoscopic lumbar decompression techniques, assessing their clinical outcomes, benefits, and limitations. It highlights the ongoing need for careful application of these methods based on individual patient factors and emphasizes the importance of balancing innovative techniques with evidence-based practices to enhance patient care in spine surgery. The future of lumbar decompression will likely be shaped by further technological advancements, including navigation systems, robotic assistance, and augmented reality, which promise to improve surgical precision and outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "The Nipah Virus (NiV) is a zoonotic pathogen with the mortality rate of up to 75%, recurring in Asia over the past two decades. Due to increasing the risk of human transmission mediated by various intermediate hosts such as pigs and bats, it is necessary to produce an accurate and reliable point-of-care molecular detection method for NiV field diagnosis. In this study, we designed two pairs of primers targeting the conserved G and P genes and developed a point-of-care nucleic acid detection (POC-NAD) system by integrating one-step RT-PCR, lateral flow immunoassay, and microfluidic technologies. The POC-NAD system shows high specificity and sensitivity, with a Limit of Detection (LoD) of 199.1 copies/rxn. The primers aiming to the conserved sequences enables simultaneous detection of both NiV-M and NiV-B strains. Continuous evaluation of 21 simulated clinical samples demonstrated 100% concordance with RT-PCR results. Lateral flow-based visualization improves the display time and legibility of RT-PCR results. Additionally, microfluidic chips or chambers offer disposable reagent containers and consistent PCR amplification results across various field conditions. Therefore, the diagnostic tool is suitable for real-time nucleic acid testing and NiV surveillance in resource-limited field environments.",

      "abstractText": "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 576 to 740\u00a0million people globally are infected with hookworms. It remains a significant public health threat in tropical and subtropical regions. Especially in low-income countries, hookworm infection continues to affect millions, even with the availability of modern medical advancements. The present study is based on the transmission dynamics of hookworm infection in a population by using the strategy of mathematical modeling with computational methods. The population has been categorized into the following subpopulations such as susceptible humans, infectious humans, infectious humans with heavy infection, humans recovered, worm eggs, non-infective larvae, and infectious larvae and exposed humans. Firstly, the fundamental properties like positivity and boundness are studied. The equilibrium points like hookworm-endemic equilibrium (HEE), hookworm-free equilibrium (HFE), and basic reproduction numbers for the model were computed. Secondly, the stochastic formation of the model was studied with well-known properties like positivity, and the boundedness of the hookworm model. The model has no analytical solution due to the highly complex nonlinearity of the stochastic delay differential equation (SDDEs) of the model. Methods like Euler Maruyama, stochastic Euler, stochastic Runge Kutta, and stochastic nonstandard finite difference are used for its solution and visualization of results. Also, the comparison of standard with nonstandard methods is presented to verify the efficiency of the computational method. Furthermore, the stochastic nonstandard finite difference approximation is a good agreement to restore the dynamical properties of the model like positivity, boundedness, and dynamical consistency. Also, it is shown as efficient, low-cost, and independent of the time step size. In conclusion, the theoretical and numerical results support understanding the transmission dynamics of hookworm infection in the population.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The landscape of medical education is rapidly evolving, driven by advancements in technology. This evolution has ushered in a new era characterized by digitization, connectivity, and intelligence. In this era, traditional teaching methods are being augmented with innovative technologies such as virtual learning, artificial intelligence platforms, and access to cloud-based health platforms. One notable advancement is the integration of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed models into medical education, particularly in fields like gynecological oncology.<h4>Methods</h4>This study introduces 3D reconstructed models based on real cervical cancer cases as a teaching tool for undergraduate gynecological oncology education. Participants were fourth-year Clinical Medicine students of Wuhan University, China. Using student identity document numbers for grouping, half were assigned to the control group (odd numbers) and the other half to the 3D reconstructed model teaching group (even numbers). All the students completed the pre-tests before receiving traditional teaching on cervical intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer. The control group completed the post-tests after traditional teaching alone, while the 3D reconstructed model teaching group completed the post-tests after receiving the additional 3D reconstructed model teaching. Feedback on this innovative teaching tool was collected. The pre-tests and post-tests covered cervical intraepithelial lesions, cervical cancer and staging system, and female pelvic anatomy.<h4>Results</h4>This study includes 267 students, with 134 in the control group and 133 in the 3D reconstructed model teaching group. The pre-test scores of the three tests between the control group and the 3D reconstructed model teaching group showed no statistical difference (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Compared to the control group, the post-test scores of the 3D reconstructed model teaching group in theoretical knowledge of cervical intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer, female pelvic anatomy and 2018\u00a0International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system for cervical cancer increased significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Feedback from students underscored the visual benefits and engaging nature of the models, with many expressing that the 3D models provided a clearer representation of cervical cancer and enhanced their learning experience.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The integration of 3D reconstructed models into medical education represents a promising approach to address the complexities of teaching intricate subjects in anatomy such as gynecological oncology. These models offer a more intuitive and thorough visualization of anatomical structures and pathological processes, fostering a hands-on and exploratory learning experience for students.",

      "abstractText": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnostics and treatment planning. The U-Net architecture, known for its encoder-decoder design and skip connections, is widely used but often struggles with accurately delineating complex struct ures like ICH regions. Recently, transformer models have been incorporated into medical image segmentation, improving performance by capturing long-range dependencies. However, existing methods still face challenges in incorrectly segmenting non-target areas and preserving detailed information in the target region. To address these issues, we propose a novel segmentation model that combines U-Net's local feature extraction with the transformer's global perceptiveness. Our method introduces an External Storage Module (ES Module) to capture and store feature similarities between adjacent slices, and a Top-Down Attention (TDAttention) mechanism to focus on relevant lesion regions while enhancing target boundary segmentation. Additionally, we introduce a boundary DoU loss to improve lesion boundary delineation. Evaluations on the intracranial hemorrhage dataset (IHSAH) from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, as well as the publicly available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD), demonstrate that our approach achieves DSC scores of 91.29% and 85.10% on the IHSAH and BHSD datasets, respectively, outperforming the second-best Cascaded MERIT by 2.19% and 2.05%, respectively. Moreover, our method provides enhanced visualization of lesion details, significantly aiding diagnostic accuracy.",

Literature on the treatment of COPD combined with respiratory failure published from the year of inception of the Web of Science database to December 31, 2023, was searched. CiteSpace 6.2.R7 software was used to visualize and analyze the published articles. A bibliometric analysis of the publications, keyword co-occurrence analysis, keyword clustering analysis, and keyword emergence analysis were performed to draw a correlation map and analyze the results. A total of 369 articles were analyzed. An overall increasing trend was observed in the number of publications. The network of researchers was relatively dense, and a core team was clearly observed. The researchers' affiliations were mainly European universities and hospitals, and close cooperation between institutions was observed. The keyword analysis obtained high-frequency keywords such as \"noninvasive ventilation\", \"mechanical ventilation\", and \"positive pressure ventilation\". The keyword clustering analysis revealed 10 clusters, and the keyword emergence analysis yielded 20 keywords. The focus of attention internationally has been on respiratory failure classification and types of ventilation support, such as high-flow oxygenation and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Future directions should include clinical research on high-flow oxygen administration to improve patient prognosis and the application of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal technology to enhance patients' quality of life.",

      "abstractText": "Calcaneal osteotomy is frequently used in correcting various foot deformities. Minimally invasive procedures such as minimally invasive calcaneus osteotomy (MICO) have become established because of their more favorable risk profile. The literature describes a safe zone for performing the osteotomy to protect the nerve structures. Overall, the existence of a \"safe zone\" remains controversial. The aim of this anatomical study was to determine the risk of nerve injury in the context of MICO. Twenty fresh frozen specimens were randomized to a V-shaped and oblique MICO groups. Following the skin incision, the osteotomies were performed with a Shannon burr. The nerve structures were then investigated both medially and laterally. After visualization of the osteotomy plane, standardized distance measurements were taken from the plane to the nerve and injuries were detected. Radiographs were then taken of all specimens, and the safe zone on each was measured and outlined. The evaluation of the safe zone showed that in 17 of 20 cases the osteotomies we performed were located within the safe zone. We found 10 nerve injuries on 8 of 20 specimens. The medial calcaneal nerve was most vulnerable Overall, we found no significant correlation between the frequency of injured nerves and the type of osteotomy (P\u2009=\u2009.361). MICO is a procedure with a low-risk profile. We found that nerve injuries can occur despite compliance with surgical standards and the relative \"safe zone\" previously described. Other options for protecting the nerve structures and further investigations into the type of osteotomies should be carried out. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be investigated.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Lumbosacral nerve root anomalies are relatively rare but can be a risk factor for intraoperative nerve injury. However, it is often difficult to evaluate them with preoperative imaging. We developed a software that automatically generates three-dimensional (3D) nerve root images from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using artificial intelligence (AI). This study aims to evaluate the accuracy and utility of this modality in clinical practice by conducting an epidemiological study of nerve root anomalies.<h4>Methods</h4>The incidence and morphology of nerve root anomalies were evaluated in the 3D images of 1,500 patients. The accuracy of the images was evaluated by comparing the images generated automatically using this AI software with those created manually by conventional methods.<h4>Results</h4>Of 1,500 cases, 53 (3.5%) had nerve root anomalies with total of 58 nerve root anomalies. With respect to the spinal level, 35 nerve root anomalies were found in the L5-S1 level, the most common (60.3%). As for morphology, 47 nerve roots (81.0%) were of the Neidre-MacNab classification Type 1. The images matched in 1,493 out of 1,500 cases (99.5%) between the two methods, and the remaining 7 cases all had nerve root abnormalities, which were detected as abnormal by the AI software.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The MR nerve root 3D imaging provided a 3D visualization and understanding of nerve root morphology, including nerve root anomalies. The AI software enables easy and precise 3D nerve root imaging, which greatly aids in the preoperative evaluation for spinal surgery.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Evaluating High-Resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (HR-OCT) versus standard spectral domain OCT in pigmented choroidal lesions.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened a total of 40 subjects with pigmented choroidal lesions. Lesions were imaged on HR-OCT and standard OCT devices with and without enhanced depth imaging (EDI) mode. Images were graded for qualitative and quantitative aspects, like choriocapillaris compression and width, choroidal reflectivity and thickness, amongst others.<h4>Results</h4>32 of the 40 subjects could be included in the image analysis, the rest were excluded due to insufficient imaging. HR-OCT EDI mode allowed visualization of the posterior choroidal extent in 11 lesions (11/32\u2009=\u200934.4%) versus in six (6/32; 18.8%), four (4/30; 13.3%), and five cases (5/30; 16.7%) in normal HR-OCT (n\u2009=\u200932), standard OCT (n\u2009=\u200930) and OCT EDI mode (n\u2009=\u200930), respectively, albeit not significantly different. Choriocapillaris compression was evident in 10 cases on HR-OCT and equally visible in all imaging modes. Mean choriocapillaris thickness ranged from 11.6 to 13.9 microns (SD range 3.84-4.33), and compressed choriocapillaris thickness similarly ranged from a mean of 7.1 to 7.8 microns (SD range 2.20-3.55). Image quality declined significantly towards the periphery in three out of four modes (p\u2009=\u20090.0077 to p\u2009=\u20090.29).<h4>Conclusions</h4>HR-OCT may provide better visibility of retinal and choroidal structures in pigmented choroidal lesions, although image quality is reduced in attempting to image peripheral lesions.<h4>Translational relevance</h4>The prototype HR-OCT offers insights into clinical features of pigmented choroidal lesions that are not apparent on conventional OCT imaging. This supports the development of HR-OCTolution OCT devices.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>This paper aims to explore the research hot spot and development trend in osteosarcoma treatment using a bibliometric method based upon Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) platform over the last decade.<h4>Methods</h4>The literature related to osteosarcoma and cure which were published from January 2014 to December 2023 were retrieved from the database of WoSCC and made an overall analysis for the papers published including number of articles, distribution of countries and institutions, author information, and keywords, with the CiteSpace 6.2.R5.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3131 papers were retrieved, including 2601 articles and 530 reviews, and the number of papers published has been increasing year by year in the last decade. There were 415 countries and 10,719 research institutions participating into the study. China's output of literature was the highest relying on its 1490 papers published, followed by The United States (548 papers). Shanghai Jiaotong university had the largest number of papers published (121 papers) and Central South University ranked second (82 papers). A total of 16,816 authors participated in the study. The number of the paper published by Massimo Serra of the Rizzoli Orthopaedics Institute was the largest (27 papers), followed by Dominique Heymann of the University of Sheffield (20 papers). The visualization analysis of keywords by CiteSpace software showed that the drug resistance, drug delivery, tumor tissue engineering and gene expression have become hotspots in the field of osteosarcoma treatment. Drug resistance significantly limits the effectiveness of current cancer treatments. Drug delivery technology not only enhances the targeting and efficacy of drugs but also helps to overcome drug resistance. The stem cells, targeted therapy, and tumor microenvironment represent the new research trends. In particular, the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in tumor development, progression, and drug resistance, and it offers numerous potential therapeutic targets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our investigation has identified key research foci and hotspots in osteosarcoma treatment, including drug resistance mechanisms, innovations in drug delivery technology, stem cell development, tumor microenvironment analysis, the development of novel therapies, and the clinical translation of tumor tissue engineering.",
