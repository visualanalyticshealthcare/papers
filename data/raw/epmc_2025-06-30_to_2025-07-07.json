      "abstractText": "Digital health interventions (DHIs) are widely used to manage users' health in everyday life through digital devices. The use of DHIs generates various data, such as records of intervention use and the status of target symptoms, providing researchers with data-driven insights for improving these interventions even after deployment. Although DHI researchers have investigated these data, existing analysis practices have been fragmented, limiting a comprehensive understanding of the data. We proposed an analysis task model to help DHI researchers analyze observational data from a holistic perspective. This model was then used to prototype an interactive visual analytics tool. We aimed to evaluate the suitability of the model for DHI data analysis and explore task support using a visual analytics tool. We constructed a data analysis task model using 3 key components (ie, user grouping criteria) for DHI data analysis: user characteristics, user engagement with DHIs, and the effectiveness of DHIs on target symptoms based on comparisons before and after the intervention. On the basis of this model, we designed Maum Health Analytics, a medium-fidelity prototype of an interactive visual analytics tool. Each feature of the prototype was mapped one-to-one to the analysis task described in the model. To investigate whether the proposed model adequately reflects real-world DHI analysis needs, we conducted a preliminary user study with 5 groups of researchers (N=15). Participants explored the tool through scenario-based analysis tasks using in-the-wild data collected from a mobile DHI service targeting depressive symptoms. Following the session, we conducted interviews to assess the appropriateness of the defined tasks and the usability and practical utility of the visual analytics tool. DHI researchers responded positively to both the analysis task model and the visual analytics tool. In the interviews, participants noted that the tool supported the identification of users who needed additional care, informed content recommendations, and helped analyze intervention effectiveness in relation to user characteristics and engagement levels. They also appreciated the tool's role in simplifying analytic tasks and supporting communication across multidisciplinary teams. Additional suggestions included improvements for continuity across tasks and more detailed engagement metrics. We proposed an analysis task model and designed an interactive visual analytics tool to support DHI researchers. Our user study showed that the model allows a holistic investigation of DHI data by integrating key analysis components and that the prototype tool simplifies analytic tasks and enhances communication among researchers. As DHIs grow, the proposed model and tool can effectively meet the data analysis requirements of researchers and improve efficiency.",

      "abstractText": "Autopsy personnel face substantial occupational risks from exposure to infectious agents, particularly during aerosol-generating procedures like bone sawing. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these dangers, underscoring the need for innovative safety solutions in resource-limited settings without negative-pressure autopsy suites. To address this, we developed a Low-Cost Infection Containment Chamber (LCICC)-a full-length, transparent, and impermeable structure designed to contain aerosols during high-risk autopsy procedures. This study evaluated the efficacy of LCICC using goat skulls to simulate aerosol generation during sawing. Aerosol densities were measured under both open-air conditions and with LCICC use, employing fluorescein dye for visualization and particle counter for quantification. Statistical analysis confirmed the chamber's effectiveness in reducing occupational exposure. LCICC demonstrated a substantial reduction in aerosol levels, ranging from 85.96 to 88.38% across all particle sizes. Median aerosol densities were consistently recorded at 10.50\u00a0mg/m\u00b3 with LCICC use, compared to 74.80 to 90.40\u00a0mg/m\u00b3 in open-air conditions. LCICC's affordability, ease of assembly, and reliable performance position it as a groundbreaking tool for protecting healthcare workers, particularly in low-resource settings. This innovation addresses critical gaps in autopsy safety protocols, offering a practical solution to mitigate risks associated with infectious aerosols while advancing occupational health standards in forensic pathology.",

      "abstractText": "The increasing adoption of advanced simulation technologies (virtual reality, augmented reality, sophisticated mannequins) in anatomical science education offers undeniable pedagogical advantages, including safe practice environments and enhanced visualization of complex structures. This article explores the simulation paradox, arguing that the very features enhancing technical mastery-such as control, predictability, cleanliness, and the absence of lasting consequences-may inadvertently impede the cultivation of professional empathy, ethical sensitivity, and the capacity to navigate ambiguity. By potentially sanitizing the profound encounter with the human form and minimizing exposure to the visceral realities, emotional weight, and inherent variability of human biology and mortality, an overreliance on \"perfect\" simulations risks producing practitioners less equipped for the vital affective and interpersonal dimensions of healthcare. Drawing on social science perspectives and educational ethics, this article critiques this potential trade-off and advocates for a balanced approach. It proposes integrating simulation with pedagogical strategies that intentionally foster humanistic competencies, such as hybrid models incorporating tangible experiences, structured reflective practice, explicit humanities integration, and emphasizing the educator's role in modeling empathy. The purpose is to urge critical evaluation of how technology is deployed, ensuring it serves, rather than subverts, the development of holistic, compassionate healthcare professionals.",

      "abstractText": "It is commonly known that physicians are subjected to high levels of stress in their jobs, which can result in physical, psychological, and emotional problems, including burnout. To prevent these negative results, international research has been conducted on the levels of stress, burnout, and associated psychiatric illness in health workers across a wide range of specialties. To determine the predictors of burnout syndrome among physicians, to compare burnout among specialist physicians, to determine if there are age differences as it relates to burnout, and to determine several predictive factors responsible for burnout among physicians. The study employed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to measure burnout levels among physicians and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) questionnaires to assess their overall well-being. A total of 3,400 physicians participated, providing a substantial dataset for analysis. The methodology involved descriptive statistics to summarize key findings, bar charts for data visualization, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine significant differences between groups where applicable. Additionally, multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify key predictors of burnout and their impact on physicians' quality of life, offering valuable insights into factors influencing their professional well-being. This study assessed professional burnout among physicians using the adapted Maslach Burnout Inventory. Of the 3400 respondents, 14% reported mild burnout, 18% moderate, 29% high, and 39% very high burnout. No significant differences in burnout were found across specialties (F\u2009=\u20090.951, p\u2009=\u20090.386). However, age, physical and psychological health, social relationships, and environment significantly predicted burnout (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Younger physicians (18-30 years) experienced the highest burnout. Engagement with COVID-19 outpatients positively correlated with burnout (r\u2009=\u20090.023, p\u2009<\u20090.05), while private practice had a moderately negative but insignificant relationship (r = -\u00a00.426). This study demonstrates a high level of burnout among physicians and several predictors of burnout in healthcare workers, which include age, psychological status, social status, and environment.",

      "abstractText": "Depression is very common in middle-aged and elderly cancer patients, which will seriously damage the quality of life and treatment effect of patients. This study aims to use machine learning methods to develop a predictive model to identify depression risk. However, since the traditional machine learning models have 'black box nature', Shapley Additive exPlanation is used to determine the key risk factors. This study included 743 cancer patients aged 45 and above from the 2011-2020 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), and analyzed a total of 19 variables including demographic factors, economic factors, health factors, family factors, and personal factors. After screening the predictive features by LASSO regression, in order to determine the best model for prediction, six machine learning models-Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Multi-layer Perceptron, Decision Tree, XGBoost and Random Forest were trained. After training, the random forest model showed the best decision performance, AUC (95% CI): 0.774 (0.740-0.809). Subsequently, the model was interpreted by Shapley Additive exPlanation, and five key characteristics affecting the risk of depression were found. The feature importance plot intuitively shows that the predicted depression risk is significantly increased for patients with poor life satisfaction. We developed a clinical visualization model for health care providers to estimate the risk of depression in middle-aged and elderly cancer patients. As a powerful tool for early identification of depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly cancer patients, this model enables medical workers to implement clinical interventions earlier to obtain better clinical benefits.",

      "abstractText": "Thrombosis of arteriovenous fistulas represents a prevalent complication among patients undergoing hemodialysis, characterized by a notably high incidence rate. Presently, there is an absence of robust assessment tools capable of predicting thrombosis occurrence. This study seeks to develop an interpretable machine learning model to forecast the risk of arteriovenous fistula thrombosis. Clinical data were retrospectively collected from 1,168 patients who received hemodialysis via arteriovenous fistulas at The Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 2017 and October 2024. A comprehensive analysis of 55 features was conducted utilizing Python. The dataset was partitioned into a training set and a test set, comprising 70% and 30% of the samples, respectively. Six distinct machine learning models-namely, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes-were constructed to predict the risk of thrombosis in arteriovenous fistulas. The performance of these models was assessed utilizing several metrics, including the F1 score, precision, specificity, accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and recall rate. The contribution of each feature within the most effective model was evaluated using SHAP values, and a specific case was selected to demonstrate the model's predictive capability. The study encompassed a cohort of 974 patients, each characterized by 55 clinical data features. Among the six machine learning models evaluated, the Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.984. SHAP visualization analysis identified the number of surgeries, stenosis, free fatty acids, platelet count, and C-reactive protein as the five most significant features influencing the risk of arteriovenous fistula thrombosis. We developed a Random Forest model based on patients' clinical data, which effectively predicts the risk of thrombosis in arteriovenous fistulas. SHAP analysis offers the potential to inform personalized and evidence-based nursing interventions for healthcare professionals.",

This study evaluates the impact of the use of patient-specific 3D liver models and surgical navigation on procedural complexity in open liver surgery. Patients with colorectal liver metastases scheduled for open liver surgery were included between June 2022 and October 2023 at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Patient-specific 3D liver models could be used upon request during the surgical procedure. Subsequently, surgeons could request additional surgical navigation by landmark registration using an electromagnetically tracked ultrasound transducer. Postoperatively, surgeons assessed the impact of the use of the model and navigation on procedural complexity on a scale from 1 to 10. 35 patients were included in this study, with a median number of 8 (ranging from 3 to 25) tumors. 3D models were utilized in all procedures. Additional navigation was requested in 21/35 of patients to improve intraoperative planning and tumor localization. The mean procedural complexity score with navigation was 4.3 (95% CI [3.7, 5.0]), compared to 7.8 (95% CI [6.6, 9.0]) with the 3D model alone. Both visualization methods improved lesion localization and provided better anatomical insight. 3D models and surgical navigation significantly reduce the complexity of open liver surgery, especially in patients with bilobar disease. These tools enhance intraoperative decision-making and may lead to better surgical outcomes. The stepwise implementation of the visualization techniques in this study underscores the added benefit of surgical navigation beyond 3D modeling alone, supporting its potential for broader clinical implementation.",

      "abstractText": "Oral cancer has a high mortality rate primarily due to delayed diagnoses, highlighting the need for early detection of oral lesions. This study presents a novel deep learning framework for multi-class classification-based segmentation, enabling accurate differential diagnosis of 14 common oral lesions-benign, pre-malignant, and malignant-across various mouth locations using photographic images. A dataset of 2,072 clinical images was used to train and validate the model. The proposed framework integrates EfficientNet-B3 for classification and ResNet-101-based Mask R-CNN for segmentation, achieving a classification accuracy of 74.49% and segmentation performance with an average precision (AP50) of 72.18. The gradient-weighted class activation map technique was applied to the model outputs to enable visualization of the specific areas that were most influential for predictive decisions made by the model. This significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art, where previous models achieved lower segmentation accuracy (AP50\u2009<\u200950%). The framework not only classifies the lesion type but also delineates the lesion boundaries with high precision, which is critical for early detection and differential diagnosis in clinical practice.",

      "abstractText": "Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is traditionally identified on ECG but echocardiography can visualize myocardial fibrillation. The prevalence and importance of occult VF defined as a nonshockable ECG rhythm but VF by echocardiography is unknown. In this multicenter, prospective study, emergency department patients presenting following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were eligible for inclusion if echocardiography and ECG were performed simultaneously. Recorded echocardiography and ECG were interpreted separately by physicians blinded to all patient and resuscitation information. The primary outcome was percentage of occult VF. The secondary outcomes included survival to hospital discharge, termination of defibrillated VF, and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Termination of VF is described as a postdefibrillation change in ECG rhythm to a nonshockable rhythm. Multivariate modeling accounted for confounding variables. Of 811 patients enrolled, 5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9 to 7.1) demonstrated occult VF. An additional 24.9% (95% CI 22.1 to 28.0) demonstrated ECG VF. Of the patients with occult VF, 81.4% demonstrated ECG pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and 18.6% demonstrated ECG asystole. Occult VF was less likely to be defibrillated compared with ECG VF. Defibrillation was not significantly more likely to terminate occult VF (75.0% vs 55.6%; odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% CI 0.42 to 15.24). ROSC was not statistically different for occult VF compared with ECG VF (39.5% vs 24.8%; OR, 2.26; 95% CI 0.87 to 5.9). Survival to hospital discharge was no different for patients with occult VF compared with ECG VF (7.0% vs 5.4%; OR, 3.6; 95% CI 0.63 to 19.2) despite fewer defibrillation attempts for patients with occult VF. Occult VF was seen in 5.3% of patients following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Recognizing and treating occult VF who otherwise would have been treated as PEA or asystole led to survival outcomes indistinguishable to traditionally recognized VF.",

      "abstractText": "Desktop virtual environments are widely used within educational contexts. Despite virtual simulation being well established in occupational therapy practice, this pedagogical strategy remains underutilized in occupational therapy education curricula. Thus, this study aimed to explore how students perceived the desktop VE-based simulation learning to better inform the usefulness of integrating virtual simulation into curricula. A qualitative methodology was employed to explore students' experiences and perceptions of engagement in the desktop-based virtual environments learning process. An interview guide was developed through consultation with faculty members based on Kolb's experiential learning theory. The interviewees were randomly selected via computer-generated randomization from a pool of 53 invited students studying occupational therapy. Based on the principles proposed by Francis and her colleagues, data saturation was reached by the 18th interview. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis framework. Four key themes were identified: (1) concrete experience: the success of D-VSim rests on resources; (2) reflective observation: resource-abundant D-VSim leads to the success of being complementary to conventional PowerPoint learning; (3) abstract conceptualization: the development in learning through dual visualization and manipulation creates the \"visual flow\"; (4) action experimentation: the D-VSim provides multi-sensory immersive opportunities for the \"repeated\" activity. These four key themes were illustrated in the ascending spiral with each layer representing one theme parallel to its corresponding sub-themes. This study supported that structured reflection enhanced learning through the medium of virtual simulation, which promoted the desktop VE-based simulation in other areas of healthcare professional education.",

      "abstractText": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a heterogeneous spectrum of surgery/anesthesia-associated neurocognitive impairments, represents a critical clinical challenge due to its associations with prolonged hospitalization, increased mortality, and accelerated long-term cognitive deterioration. The development of targeted perioperative management strategies fundamentally depends on systematic risk factor identification, though current research remains hampered by significant heterogeneity and incomplete evidence synthesis across observational studies. To address this knowledge gap, we constructed the first panoramic knowledge base integrating multidimensional POCD risk factors through systematic analysis of 2,837 PubMed-indexed clinical studies (1991-20 May 2024). Utilizing a rigorous protocol developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel, 860 distinct predictive risk factors were extracted following stringent inclusion criteria and manual curation. This knowledge synthesis framework enables hierarchical visualization of risk elements spanning demographic, clinical, anesthetic, surgical, and biomarker domains. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction knowledge base (POCDKB) is a retrospective database study that serves dual translational purposes: providing clinicians with evidence-based decision support for personalized perioperative treatment plans, and establishing standardized data parameters for future mechanistic investigations. Implemented as a dynamic platform: ( http://sysbio.org.cn/pocdkb/ ), the resource features continuous evidence updates and collaborative data-sharing infrastructure to advance POCD research and therapeutic innovation.",

      "abstractText": "Echocardiography is the most primary clinical modality for dynamic cardiac imaging. However, the vigorous motion of myocardial tissue inherently causes inevitable signal aliasing between blood flow and myocardial tissue in traditional Doppler ultrasound imaging, constituting a persistent challenge in echocardiography for decades. Particularly for low-velocity flows like coronary artery blood flow, the Doppler frequency shifts completely overlap with myocardial tissue signal shifts, rendering them virtually undetectable through conventional echocardiography. This study pioneers a paradigm shift by abandoning traditional Doppler-based blood flow imaging, and develops a novel multi-cycle phase clustering method for tissue clutter suppression, successfully extracting dynamic cardiac blood flow signals with clear visualization of both coronary artery flow and cardiac chamber flow throughout the full cardiac cycle. Furthermore, through integration with super-resolution ultrasound reconstruction techniques, enhanced spatial resolution in cardiac blood flow imaging is achieved. This breakthrough establishes a novel in vivo cardiovascular flow imaging approach characterized by high spatio-temporal resolution, safety, and clinical accessibility, demonstrating significant potential for advancing the diagnosis of cardiovascular\u00a0diseases.",

      "abstractText": "Worldwide, thousands of people suffer from laryngeal diseases, many of which involve the posterior glottis or subglottis. These laryngeal areas are challenging to visualize with conventional transnasal and transoral laryngoscopes because the view from above is obscured by the disease itself, thereby limiting the efficacy of endoscopy in diagnosis and treatment. Advancements in miniaturized optical systems overcome these limitations and allow for real-time visualization of difficult-to-access laryngeal subsites such as the posterior glottis and subglottis. The present study introduces a novel device, the subglottic imaging puncture scope (SIPS), to access and image the subglottic space via a transcervical puncture. The SIPS has a miniature, high-resolution camera integrated within a medical-grade gauge 18 needle. The small-diameter needle allows for minimal invasiveness, similar to established laryngeal therapeutic drug delivery techniques. A detailed description of the camera and light source alignments are provided. Images from video footage obtained in human cadavers are provided, validating the hypothesis that a minimally invasive device allows imaging of the subglottis. The SIPS will improve diagnostic accuracy and patient comfort, enabling the full extent of subglottic pathology to be imaged on awake patients in a clinical office setting.",

Data were extracted from the MIMIC-IV 3.0 database and divided into a training set and a validation set in a 7:3 ratio. Relevant risk factors were identified through LASSO regression, and a binary logistic regression model was subsequently developed. The CRRT risk nomogram was visualized using R language, with the DynNom package employed to create a dynamic nomogram. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Harrell's C-index, and calibration curves. The clinical utility of the model was evaluated via decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 7361 septic patients were included in this study, of which 525 required CRRT. The study identified several predictive factors for CRRT, including respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), creatinine, lactate, pH, body weight, renal disease, and severe liver disease. The C-index was 0.871. The AUCs for the training and validation sets were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.8535-0.8883) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.8282-0.8887), respectively. The calibration curves demonstrated good predictive consistency. DCA confirmed the model's significant clinical value. The dynamic nomogram is available for visualization at: https://zhong-hua-min-zu-wan-sui.shinyapps.io/CRRT_prediction_nomogram/ . We have developed a dynamic nomogram based on the MIMIC-IV database, incorporating 10 clinical features, to predict the probability of CRRT requirement in septic patients. Internal validation showed that this model exhibits robust predictive performance.",

      "abstractText": "Although there has been progress in developing T-cell receptor (TCR)-based biomarkers to predict clinical benefit (CB) in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, studies on the circulating TCR repertoire in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain limited. Therefore, further investigation and validation of the TCR repertoire as a potential biomarker for predicting the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy are needed. Blood samples were collected from patients with advanced NSCLC before initiating anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody treatment in combination with chemotherapy. Next-generation sequencing was used to analyze the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the T cell receptor beta (TRB)gene. Richness, Shannon diversity indices, and the usage of variable and joining genes were studied. TCR repertoire metrics were then correlated with CB, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). We found that the number of unique clones and richness index were comparable between the clinical benefit (CB) and no-clinical benefit (non-CB) groups. A high number of unique clones and a higher richness index were correlated with clinical benefit among patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy (ChIO) therapy. However, despite this association, a statistically non-significant correlation was observed between any of the TCR repertoire metrics and PFS or OS in patients treated with ChIO. Higher TRBJ2-1 frequencies were associated with clinical benefit. Most clonotypes contained CDR3 fragments ranging from 12 to 16 amino acids in length. However, visualization of the relative similarity of TCR repertoires using multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that TCR repertoires of the benefit group could not be separated from those of the benefit group. The circulating TCR repertoire may serve as a potential tool for predicting clinical outcomes of anti-PD-1 plus chemotherapy, aiding the selection of patients likely to experience clinical benefit. Further large-scale prospective studies are required to validate these findings. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12885-025-14523-z.",

      "abstractText": "To provide a novel direction for the diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC). The differentially expressed blood microRNAs (miRNAs) in gastric carcinoma were screened through SangerBox using the datasets GSE113486, GSE112264, and GSE113740. The miRNA-target genes prediction, conduct Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analyses were performed with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) 6.8. STRING analysis was further investigated with Cytoscape. The correlations among the expression levels of key miRNAs and prognosis/diagnostic value in GC patients were determined by survival prognosis and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was employed to detect the different expression levels of key miRNAs in human blood samples. In the process, the influence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection on expression levels of miRNAs was analyzed with Gene Expression Omnibus 2R (GEO2R) in dataset GSE108307. To evaluate these findings, the expression level of Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), along with clinical markers used in the help of GC pathologic diagnosis, were measured and compared with the key miRNAs obtained in this study. The bioinformatics analysis identified five crucial blood miRNAs, including hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-125a-3p, hsa-miR-29b-3p, hsa-miR-4276, and hsa-miR-575. The detection in human blood samples combined with cross-analysis involving H. pylori infection, the expression levels of CagA and clinical markers underscored the significance and effectiveness of these specific miRNAs in early diagnosis and monitoring of gastric carcinoma. This study identified five potential blood miRNA biomarkers for GC through bioinformatics analysis coupled with detection in human blood samples, thus providing new possibilities for important biomarkers related to diagnosis and prognosis of GC.",

      "abstractText": "Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory condition of the periodontium, is associated with over 60 systemic diseases. Despite advancements, precision medicine approaches have had limited success, emphasizing the need for deeper insights into cellular subpopulations and structural immunity, particularly gingival keratinocytes. This study employs autoencoder models and data augmentation techniques to explore the transcriptomic diversity of gingival keratinocytes at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from GSE266897 were processed using the Scanpy library, with quality control implemented to filter cells based on predefined metrics. Clustering was performed using principal component analysis (PCA) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms. Marker gene identification and differential expression analysis were used to characterize cell clusters. Visualization techniques, including UMAP, heatmaps, dot plots, and violin plots, provided insights into gene expression patterns. The autoencoder architecture featured an encoder reducing input size to 256 units with ReLU activation, a bottleneck layer, and a decoder restoring data dimensions. The basic Autoencoder (AE) demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest loss (0.725), the highest accuracy (0.695), and minimal false positives. The Test-Time Augmentation AE also performed robustly, achieving an F1 score of 0.642 and an AUC-ROC of 0.800. The Basic AE effectively modeled RNA-seq data complexity compared to Variational and Denoising Autoencoders. This study highlights advanced computational techniques to investigate gingival keratinocytes' transcriptomic diversity, revealing distinct subpopulations and differential gene expression profiles. These findings underscore the active role of keratinocytes in periodontal health and inflammatory responses, contributing to precision medicine approaches in periodontology.",

      "abstractText": "ZW10 interacting kinetochore protein (ZWINT) has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the growth, invasion, and migration of cancers. Nevertheless, whether the expression levels of ZWINT are significantly correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic outcomes of patients with breast cancer remains elusive. This study systematically investigated the clinical significance of ZWINT expression in breast cancer through integrated molecular subtyping and survival analysis. We systematically characterized the spatial expression pattern of ZWINT across various breast cancer subtypes and assessed its prognostic significance using an integrated bioinformatics approach that involved multi-omics analysis. The approach included the Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner v5.1 (bc-GenExMiner v5.1), TNMplot, MuTarget, PrognoScan database, and Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Our analysis revealed consistent upregulation of ZWINT mRNA and protein expression across distinct clinicopathological subtypes of breast cancer. ZWINT overexpression demonstrated significant co-occurrence with truncating mutations in cadherin 1 (CDH1) and tumor protein p53 (TP53), suggesting potential functional crosstalk in tumor progression pathways. The overexpression of ZWINT correlated with adverse clinical outcomes, showing 48% increased mortality risk (overall survival: HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.23-1.79), 66% higher recurrence probability (relapse-free survival: 1.66, 95% CI 1.50-1.84), and 63% elevated metastasis risk (distant metastasis-free survival: HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.39-1.90). Multivariate Cox regression incorporating TNM staging and molecular subtypes confirmed ZWINT as an independent prognostic determinant (P\u2009<\u20090.001, Harrell's C-index\u2009=\u20090.7827), which was validated through bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations). ZWINT may serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and a possible therapeutic target alongside TP53/CDH1 in breast cancer.",

      "abstractText": "Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic autoimmune condition marked by fibroinflammatory infiltration, which may present as solitary or multiple masses and organ enlargement. In advanced stages, progression to multi-organ dysfunction or failure may occur, potentially resulting in mortality. This study aimed to examine the current status and evolving research trends in IgG4-RD from 2020 to 2024 through bibliometric and visualization methodologies. A total of 1,084 English-language publications on IgG4-RD, dated from January 1, 2020, to October 22, 2024, were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric and visual analyses were performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software to identify research trends, collaborative networks, and thematic developments. The analysis included 1,084 publications, reflecting sustained research activity in the field over the examined period. The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College accounted for the greatest number of publications. Among individual contributors, Wen Zhang was identified as the most prolific author. In terms of national output, China led in publication volume, whereas Japan exhibited the highest total citation frequency. Internal Medicine published the greatest number of articles, while Modern Rheumatology had the highest citation rate. Keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed prominent research themes, including \"IgG4-related disease,\" \"autoimmune pancreatitis,\" \"case report,\" \"Rituximab,\" and \"Diagnosis.\" The global research output on IgG4-RD has demonstrated notable growth in recent years. Further investigations focusing on the emerging thematic areas may yield valuable insights that can enhance clinical diagnosis and therapeutic approaches for individuals affected by IgG4-RD.",

We seek to compare operative times and clinical outcomes between the operating exoscope (OE) and traditional operating microscopes (OM) for microlaryngeal surgery (MLS). We conducted a retrospective, single-center review of patients who underwent MLS from 2019 to 2024 using the OE or OM, comparing operative times and voice outcome measures including patient subjective vocal quality, OMNI vocal effort, and GRBAS scales. Eighty-four (45 OE and 39 OM) patients underwent MLS for primarily phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. There were no statistically significant differences in operative time (in minutes) between OE versus OM cohorts: setup time (22 vs. 21, p value\u2009=\u20090.54), procedure length (46 vs. 49, p\u2009=\u20090.45), and total patient time in OR (83 vs. 86, p\u2009=\u20090.57). There were no significant differences in pre-operative voice assessments between the OE and OM cohorts. There were also no significant differences in post-operative (4-6\u2009weeks) subjective vocal quality (7.8 vs. 7.5, p\u2009=\u20090.57), OMNI vocal effort (3.1 vs. 3.9, p\u2009=\u20090.28), or GRBAS scale (G: 0.80 vs. 0.85, p\u2009=\u20090.74; R: 0.82 vs. 0.72, p\u2009=\u20090.46; B: 0.26 vs. 0.41, p\u2009=\u20090.24; A: 0.18 vs. 0.10, p\u2009=\u20090.36; S: 0.56 vs. 0.51, p\u2009=\u20090.75). There were no serious intraoperative or postoperative complications in either cohort. This is the first study directly comparing the OE to the OM in MLS. Our findings demonstrate non-inferiority of the OE compared to the OM for operative times and voice outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "Patients with early breast cancer typically have a relatively favorable prognosis, although recurrence still occurs in some cases. We hypothesized that nonvisualized lymphoscintigraphy (nonvLSG) during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) might signal lymphatic obstruction caused by tumor burden, potentially leading to poorer overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). This single-center retrospective cohort study included 247 patients with early breast cancer who underwent SLNB (between 1999 and 2003). Patients were grouped into visualized lymphoscintigraphy (vLSG) and nonvLSG cohorts. Clinical characteristics, SLNB outcomes, and survival data were analyzed over a median follow-up of 12.2 years (4 months-24 years). RFS and OS were compared using Kaplan\u2012Meier (K-M) and Cox regression analyses. Of the 247 patients, 223 (90.3%) had a vLSG, whereas 24 (9.7%) had a nonvLSG. Hormone receptor positivity was lower in the nonvLSG group (62.5% vs. 80.3%, p=0.03). K\u2012M survival analyses revealed no significant differences in OS or RFS between the vLSG and nonvLSG groups. Regarding OS, the log-rank test yielded p=0.927, and for RFS, p=0.762, indicating similar survival outcomes between the groups. At 20 years, estimated OS probabilities were 75% for the visualized group and 70% for the nonvisualized group, and RFS probabilities were approximately 70% for both groups. Lymphoscintigraphy visualization status was not significantly associated with OS and RFS in patients with early breast cancer undergoing SLNB. This suggests that nonvisualization does not indicate a greater tumor burden or poorer prognosis. Clinically, this reassures that treatment strategies do not need to be adjusted solely based on nonvisualization in lymphoscintigraphy.",

      "abstractText": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) present serious risks in clinical settings, especially for patients who are prescribed multiple medications. A major factor contributing to these interactions is the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, which are vital for drug metabolism. As a result, reliably identifying compounds that may inhibit CYP450 enzymes is a key step in drug development. However, existing machine learning (ML) methods often fall short in terms of prediction accuracy and biological interpretability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Multimodal Encoder Network (MEN) aimed at improving the prediction of CYP450 inhibitors. This model combines three types of molecular data (chemical fingerprints, molecular graphs, and protein sequences) by applying specialized encoders tailored to each format. Specifically, the Fingerprint Encoder Network (FEN) processes molecular fingerprints, the Graph Encoder Network (GEN) extracts structural features from graph-based representations, and the Protein Encoder Network (PEN) captures sequential patterns from protein sequences. By integrating these diverse data types, MEN can extract complementary information that enhances predictive performance. The encoded outputs from FEN, GEN, and PEN are fused to build a comprehensive feature representation. An explainable AI (XAI) module is incorporated into the model to support biological interpretation, using visualization techniques such as heatmaps. The model was trained and validated using two datasets: chemical structures in SMILES format from PubChem and protein sequences of five CYP450 isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). MEN achieved an average accuracy of 93.7% across all isoforms. The individual encoders performed with accuracies of 80.8% (FEN), 82.3% (GEN), and 81.5% (PEN). Additional performance results include an AUC of 98.5%, sensitivity of 95.9%, specificity of 97.2%, precision of 80.6%, F1-score of 83.4%, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 88.2%.

      "abstractText": "The potential benefits of the ketogenic diet (KD) on ageing are currently receiving increasing attention. Although there are various studies on this subject in the existing literature, there is a lack of systematic review and bibliometric analysis. This study aimed to present a bibliometric overview and visualization analysis of the existing studies examining the relationship between KD and ageing, identify trends in this field, and provide a basis for future research and sustainable development goals. This study involved a systematic review of the literature. In this study, Scopus (Elsevier) and Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) databases were used for bibliometric analysis. In the study, all articles, reviews, and other types of publications on KD and ageing published between 1995 and 2024 were analysed. Studies covering the years 1995-2025 and including the keywords 'ketogenic diet OR ketogenic diets OR ketone diet AND aging AND PUB YEAR > 1995 AND PUBYEAR < 2025' in the title were included. The VOSviewer software (VOSviewer v.1.6.10) was utilized to visualize the data. The data obtained were evaluated by bibliometric methods, such as keyword analysis and cluster analysis. A significant increase in the number of studies on KD and ageing was observed. In the study, when the data obtained from WoSCC and Scopus databases and VOSviewer analysis results were evaluated together, a total of 10,170 scientific documents in the Scopus database and a total of 168 scientific documents were identified in the Web of Science database between 1995-2025 worldwide. The author publishing the most on the subject was found to be Cunnane, S.C. The country contributing the most to the field was found to be the United States of America (USA). The institution that produced the most documents was Harvard Medical School. In a total of 10,170 records, the most preferred type of publication was articles. Nutrients journal was the journal with the highest number of publications. According to the results of keyword analysis, the words \"ketogenic diet\" and \"aging\" were the most frequently used and most strongly related words. The results of this study showed a significant increase in the number of studies investigating the effects of KD on ageing. More high-quality, randomised controlled clinical trials are needed in this field. In particular, there is a lack of studies examining the effects of KD on age-related diseases at the molecular level.",

      "abstractText": "BackgroundVenous sinus stenting (VSS) is an established treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and pulsatile tinnitus (PT), but optimal patient selection remains a challenge. Current protocols rely on catheter angiography and manometry-based pressure gradients, which can be operator-dependent and subject to measurement variability. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) offers real-time, cross-sectional visualization of venous anatomy, potentially providing more consistent and objective assessments of stenosis severity.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study of 31 patients undergoing venography with IVUS over an eight-month period for suspected venous sinus stenosis. The point of maximal stenosis severity was measured using both angiography and IVUS, and findings were compared to intravascular pressure gradients. A pressure difference or gradient of \u22658 mmHg in IIH and \u22654 mmHg in PT across the stenosis was considered clinically significant based on prior prospective trial criteria.ResultsPatients included those with IIH (41.9%) or PT (58.1%). Mean maximal stenosis was 51.2% by angiography and 65.2% by IVUS. The agreement between different reviewers measuring angiographic stenosis was low (r\u00b2=.19), and IVUS-based stenosis correlated more strongly with pressure gradients than angiographic estimates (r\u2009=\u2009.78 vs. .46, p\u2009=\u2009.044). An IVUS-measured stenosis \u226553.2% predicted a clinically significant pressure gradient (\u22658 mmHg) with 100% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity. No IVUS-related complications occurred.ConclusionIVUS is a safe and promising adjunct to conventional venography for assessing venous sinus stenosis, with stronger correlation to physiologic pressure gradients than angiographic estimates. These findings suggest that IVUS may enhance patient selection for venous sinus stenting by more accurately identifying candidates likely to benefit from intervention, potentially increasing treatment eligibility and intervention rates. By refining diagnostic accuracy, IVUS may also contribute to improved long-term symptom relief. Nonetheless, given the retrospective, single-center design and limited sample size, larger prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and assess their impact on clinical outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "Nurse voice behavior is a critical factor in ensuring patient safety. Although there is a correlation between voice behavior and psychological safety within nurse teams, the intricate relationship between them has not been sufficiently explored in the literature. A multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted. From April to June 2022, clinical nurses were recruited from five cities in Guangdong Province, China using convenience sampling. Data were collected using validated scales, including the Voice Behavior Scale and Team Psychological Safety Climate Scale. Network analysis was employed to visualize the interactive relationships among variables. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 for baseline characteristics description. Network analysis was conducted on the RStudio platform, with network visualization implemented using the \"qgraph\" package, network centrality metrics calculated via the \"qgraph\" and \"networktools\" package, and network accuracy estimation along with stability testing performed using the \"bootnet\" package. This study included a total of 812 nurses, with a mean age of 33.94\u2009\u00b1\u20097.95 years, of whom 96.6% were female. The mean scores for the voice behavior scale and the team psychological safety scale were 37.04\u2009\u00b1\u20095.88 and 58.01\u2009\u00b1\u20097.57, respectively. Network analysis revealed that the edges between nurses' voice behavior and team psychological safety were primarily positively correlated. Thestrongest influence was observed for \"team members respect the suggestions and perspectives of others\", which had the highest expected influence coefficient. Bridging connections included \" if there is a problem with the work of the unit, dare to put forward opinions and suggestions \", \" express your opinion on phenomena that affect work efficiency in the unit, without fear of embarrassment \", \" timely dissuade other employees in the unit from bad behavior that affects work efficiency \", \" most team members are receptive to new ideas or ways of thinking \", and \" collaborate with team members to develop skills and expertise \". These findings highlighted critical pathways linking voice behavior and psychological safety in nursing teams. The study revealed moderate levels of voice behavior and team psychological safety among Chinese nurses. Utilizing network analysis, we elucidated the intricate dynamics between these two constructs, identifying six pivotal influencing factors: (1) team members respect the suggestions and perspectives of others, (2) if there is a problem with the work of the unit, dare to put forward opinions and suggestions, (3) express your opinion on phenomena that affect work efficiency in the unit, without fear of embarrassment, (4) timely dissuade other employees in the unit from bad behavior that affects work efficiency, (5) most team members are receptive to new ideas or ways of thinking, and (6) collaborate with team members to develop skills and expertise. These findings underscore the potential for targeted interventions aimed at strengthening these key dimensions to enhance psychological safety and promote voice behavior within nursing teams, ultimately improving team dynamics and organizational outcomes.
