      "abstractText": "The emergence of psychosis in early adulthood necessitates rapid, specialized care to improve outcomes and reduce the duration of untreated psychosis. Early intervention services (EIS) for First Episode Psychosis (FEP) are exemplars of healthcare reform but face challenges in sustaining durable improvements across patients' lifetime illnesses. Learning Health Systems (LHS) present a transformative framework, integrating care delivery with continuous quality improvement and research. In this paper, we detail the development and evolution of the Health Outcomes Network and Education (HONE), a novel informatics platform designed to support an LHS for FEP. HONE facilitates data harmonization, analytics, and visualization to drive quality improvement, leveraging user-centered design to engage clinicians and align with clinical workflows. The platform emphasizes evidence-based outcomes, integrating diverse data sources, including patient-reported outcomes, clinical assessments, and external datasets, within a harmonized repository. By employing a minimalist, question-based approach to data visualization, HONE delivers actionable insights that inform clinical practice while generating research questions to improve care. We discuss key lessons from HONE's development, including the importance of user engagement, iterative refinement, and balancing standardization with site-specific flexibility. HONE has been successfully deployed across multi-site networks, demonstrating its scalability and adaptability to diverse healthcare settings. This paper highlights HONE's contributions to bridging the gap between knowledge and care, fostering bi-directional knowledge translation, and advancing mental health outcomes. Future efforts will focus on expanding HONE's reach, integrating predictive analytics, and evaluating its long-term impact on FEP care within the LHS framework.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Falls are a prevalent and serious health condition among older people in residential aged care facilities, causing significant health and economic burdens. However, the likelihood of future falls can be predicted, and thus, falls can be prevented if appropriate prevention programs are implemented. Current fall prevention programs in residential aged care facilities rely on risk screening tools with suboptimal predictive performance, leading to significant concerns regarding resident safety.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to develop a predictive, dynamic dashboard to identify residents at risk of falls with associated decision support. This paper provides an overview of the technical process, including the challenges faced and the strategies used to overcome them during the development of the dashboard.<h4>Methods</h4>A predictive dashboard was co-designed with a major residential aged care partner in New South Wales, Australia. Data from resident profiles, daily medications, fall incidents, and fall risk assessments were used. A dynamic fall risk prediction model and personalized rule-based fall prevention recommendations were embedded in the dashboard. The data ingestion process into the dashboard was designed to mitigate the impact of underlying data system changes. This approach aims to ensure resilience against alterations in the data systems.<h4>Results</h4>The dashboard was developed using Microsoft Power BI and advanced R programming by linking data silos. It includes dashboard views for those managing facilities and for those caring for residents. Data drill-through functionality was used to navigate through different dashboard views. Resident-level change in daily risk of falling and risk factors and timely evidence-based recommendations were output to prevent falls and enhance prescriptive decision support.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study emphasizes the significance of a sustainable dashboard architecture and how to overcome the challenges faced when developing a dashboard amid underlying data system changes. The development process used an iterative dashboard co-design process, ensuring the successful implementation of knowledge into practice. Future research will focus on the implementation and evaluation of the dashboard's impact on health processes and economic outcomes.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>RR2-https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048657.",

Clinical knee MRI datasets from 36 patients were retrospectively compiled under IRB approval. The dark-fat water-only images were generated and compared with the conventional water-only images from two-point TSE-Dixon MRI. The water-only images from 20 patients were analyzed: (i) qualitatively by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists, for overall image quality, fat suppression, anatomical visualization, and the absence of artifacts, using Wilcoxon rank tests, and (ii) quantitatively using apparent signal-to-noise ratio (aSNR) and apparent contrast-to-noise ratio (aCNR) from regions of interest (ROIs) with paired t-test. In the remaining 16 patients, the number of cruciate ligament tears identified on MRI was tabulated and compared with arthroscopy results. Compared to conventional water-only images, dark-fat water-only images showed improved fat suppression (reader 1, P\u2009< 0.0001; reader 2, P\u2009< 0.05), improved overall image quality by reader 1 (P\u2009< 0.001), and improved visualization of the sciatic nerve for reader 1 (P\u2009< 0.01), while there were no significant differences for the other anatomical structures. aSNR was significantly reduced for bone marrow fat (P\u2009< 0.0001), and aCNR between meniscus and articular cartilage was significantly improved (P\u2009< 0.0001). There were a higher number of posterior cruciate ligament tears identified in MRI compared to arthroscopy. Dark-fat processed water-only images improved fat suppression and tissue contrast visualization, particularly sciatic nerves, compared to conventional water-only images from two-point TSE-Dixon MR imaging.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The Early Psychosis Intervention Network of California project, a learning health care network of California early psychosis intervention (EPI) programs, prioritized incorporation of community partner feedback while designing its eHealth app, Beehive. Though eHealth apps can support learning health care network data collection aims, low user acceptance or adoption can pose barriers to successful implementation. Adopting user-centered design (UCD) approaches, such as incorporation of user feedback, prototyping, iterative design, and continuous evaluation, can mitigate these potential barriers.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to use UCD during development of a data collection and data visualization web-based and tablet app, Beehive, to promote engagement with Beehive as part of standard EPI care across a diverse user-base.<h4>Methods</h4>Our UCD approach included incorporation of user feedback, prototyping, iterative design, and continuous evaluation. This started with user journey mapping to create storyboards, which were then presented in UCD workshops with service users, their support persons, and EPI providers. We incorporated feedback from these workshops into the alpha version of Beehive, which was also presented in a UCD workshop. Feedback was again incorporated into the beta version of Beehive. We provided Beehive training to 4 EPI programs who then piloted Beehive's beta version. During piloting, service users, their support persons, and EPI program providers completed Beehive surveys at enrollment and every 6 months after treatment initiation. To examine preliminary user acceptance and adoption during the piloting phase, we assessed rates of participant enrollment and survey completion, with a particular focus on completion of a prioritized survey: the Modified Colorado Symptom Index.<h4>Results</h4>UCD workshop feedback resulted in the creation of new workflows and interface changes in Beehive to improve the user experience. During piloting, 48 service users, 42 support persons, and 72 EPI program providers enrolled in Beehive. Data were available for 88% (n=42) of service users, including self-reported data for 79% (n=38), collateral-reported data for 42% (n=20), and clinician-entered data for 17% (n=8). The Modified Colorado Symptom Index was completed by 54% (n=26) of service users (total score: mean 24.16, SD 16.81). In addition, 35 service users had a support person who could complete the Modified Colorado Symptom Index, and 56% (n=19) of support persons completed it (mean 26.71, SD 14.43).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Implementing UCD principles while developing the Beehive app resulted in early workflow changes and produced an app that was acceptable and feasible for collection of self-reported clinical outcomes data from service users. Additional support is needed to increase collateral-reported and clinician-entered data.",

      "abstractText": "Breast cancer is the second most deadly malignancy in women, behind lung cancer. Despite significant improvements in medical research, breast cancer is still accurately diagnosed with histological analysis. During this procedure, pathologists examine a physical sample for the presence of mitotic cells, or dividing cells. However, the high resolution of histopathology images and the difficulty of manually detecting tiny mitotic nuclei make it particularly challenging to differentiate mitotic cells from other types of cells. Numerous studies have addressed the detection and classification of mitosis, owing to increasing capacity and developments in automated approaches. The combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques has greatly revolutionized the process of identifying mitotic cells by offering automated, precise, and efficient solutions. In the last ten years, several pioneering methods have been presented, advancing towards practical applications in clinical settings. Unlike other forms of cancer, breast cancer and gliomas are categorized according to the number of mitotic divisions. Numerous papers have been published on techniques for identifying mitosis due to easy access to datasets and open competitions. Convolutional neural networks and other deep learning architectures can precisely identify mitotic cells, significantly decreasing the amount of labor that pathologists must perform. This article examines the techniques used over the past decade to identify and classify mitotic cells in histologically stained breast cancer hematoxylin and eosin images. Furthermore, we examine the benefits of current research techniques and predict forthcoming developments in the investigation of breast cancer mitosis, specifically highlighting machine learning and deep learning.",

      "abstractText": "Cancer seriously threatens the lives and health of people worldwide, and exosomes seem to play an important role in managing cancer effectively, which has attracted extensive attention from researchers in recent years. This study aimed to scientifically visualize exosomes research in cancer (ERC) through bibliometric analysis, reviewing the past, summarizing the present, and predicting the future, with a view to providing valuable insights for scholars and policy makers. Researches search and data collection from Web of Science Core Collection and clinical trial.gov. Calculations and visualizations were performed using Microsoft Excel, VOSviewer, Bibliometrix R-package, and CiteSpace. As of December 1, 2024, and March 8, 2025, we identified 8,001 ERC-related publications and 107 ERC-related clinical trials, with an increasing trend in annual publications. Our findings supported that China, Nanjing Medical University, and International Journal of Molecular Sciences were the most productive countries, institutions, and journals, respectively. Whiteside, Theresa L. had the most publications, while Th\u00e9ry, C was the most co-cited scholar. In addition, Cancer Research was the most co-cited journal. Spatial and temporal distribution of clinical trials was the same as for publications. High-frequency keywords were \"extracellular vesicle,\" \"microRNA\" and \"biomarker.\" Additional, \"surface functionalization,\" \"plant,\" \"machine learning,\" \"nanomaterials,\" \"promotes metastasis,\" \"engineered exosomes,\" and \"macrophage-derived exosomes\" were promising research topics. Our study comprehensively and visually summarized the structure, hotspots, and evolutionary trends of ERC. It would inspire subsequent studies from a macroscopic perspective and provide a basis for rational allocation of resources and identification of collaborations among researchers.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>The fetal origins of adult disease, widely known as Barker's Hypothesis, suggest that adverse fetal environments significantly impact the risk of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, in adulthood. Recent advancements in 4D ultrasound (4D US) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer a promising avenue for improving prenatal diagnostics and validating this hypothesis. These innovations provide detailed insights into fetal behavior and neurodevelopment, linking early developmental markers to long-term health outcomes.<h4>Content</h4>This study synthesizes contemporary developments in AI-enhanced 4D US, focusing on their roles in detecting fetal anomalies, assessing neurodevelopmental markers, and evaluating congenital heart defects. The integration of AI with 4D US allows for real-time, high-resolution visualization of fetal anatomy and behavior, surpassing the diagnostic precision of traditional methods. Despite these advancements, challenges such as algorithmic bias, data diversity, and real-world validation persist and require further exploration.<h4>Summary</h4>Findings demonstrate that AI-driven 4D US improves diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, enabling earlier detection of fetal abnormalities and optimization of clinical workflows. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of fetal programming, these technologies substantiate the links between early-life conditions and adult health outcomes, as proposed by Barker's Hypothesis.<h4>Outlook</h4>The integration of AI and 4D US has the potential to revolutionize prenatal care, paving the way for personalized maternal-fetal healthcare. Future research should focus on addressing current limitations, including ethical concerns and accessibility challenges, to promote equitable implementation. Such advancements could significantly reduce the global burden of chronic diseases and foster healthier generations.",

      "abstractText": "Despite their potential, Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems often lack alignment with clinicians' needs and are underutilised in practice. Pilot implementations can help to improve the fit between systems and local needs by engaging users in real-world testing and refinement. Although pilot implementations of CDS have been reported, limited evidence has explored the factors contributing to pilot success. This study aimed to explore the opportunities and challenges associated with the pilot implementation of a CDS system that ultimately did not progress to full-scale implementation. We conducted interviews with clinicians, health service managers, and vendors involved in the pilot implementation and use of a mobile application-based CDS and a dashboard-based CDS in two departments (Emergency and Patient Flow) of a rural Australian hospital. A semi-structured interview guide was developed using the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Sustainability, Scale-up, and Spread (NASSS) framework. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed. Analysis revealed four major themes: system performance and design, implementation processes, organisational support and resources, and perceived benefits of the CDS. The pilot implementation allowed for greater user input into the iterative design of CDS in practice, particularly in the Emergency Department, where clinicians had both the capacity and willingness to engage. However, technical issues encountered early in the pilot deterred many users who did not re-engage even after issues were resolved. Although some users remained engaged, they became frustrated as organisational resource constraints meant that critical issues impacting the CDS's clinical utility went unresolved. Successful CDS pilots depend on the readiness of organisations, departments, and users to engage in pilot activities. Pilot implementations should be pursued in settings where users have both the capacity and willingness to participate in iterative feedback processes and where organisations have sufficient resources to address emerging needs.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Home blood pressure monitoring with clinical or technological support (Supported HBPM) is an evidence-based intervention recommended by national guidelines for improving hypertension (HTN) control. However, few healthcare systems have implemented Supported HBPM because it remains unclear how best to promote uptake among patients and clinicians, and the real-world effectiveness of Supported HBPM is unknown. The Monitor-BP Trial aims to determine the impact of implementing a flexible Supported HBPM program on practice-level HTN control and to evaluate the reach, adoption, maintenance, and cost-effectiveness of the program in a socioeconomically diverse primary care network.<h4>Methods</h4>The Monitor-BP Trial takes place in 15 primary care practices affiliated with two large academic medical centers in New York City. It is a hybrid 2 effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized pre-post trial testing early implementation of a Supported HBPM program (8 practices) versus usual care (7 practices). Adult patients with diagnosed HTN and their primary care clinicians are eligible for inclusion. The intervention consists of two options: 1. MyCare Hypertension, a low resource intensity option in which patients use their own BP devices to track home BP in the online patient portal with automated triage support for extreme readings and portal-delivered educational modules, and 2. RPM Hypertension, a high resource intensity option in which patients are loaned wireless BP devices that automatically transmit home BP data to the electronic health record (EHR) with telehealth navigator onboarding and nursing support to triage extreme readings. Both options include EHR-integrated ordering and home BP data visualization for clinicians. Key features of the implementation strategy include clinician education and training via presentations, clinician prompts and reminders via e-mails and mailed postcards, detailed instructional materials for patients and clinicians via websites, and at least monthly problem-solving meetings with clinical champions to iteratively tailor implementation to individual practices. The primary effectiveness outcome is practice-level pre- to post-implementation change in the mean 12-month change in office systolic BP among patients with uncontrolled office BP at baseline. The primary implementation outcomes are reach (uptake of the Supported HBPM program by patients) and adoption (uptake of the Supported HBPM program by clinicians). Secondary outcomes include estimating the short- and long-term cost-effectiveness of the program.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Monitor-BP Trial tests a scalable approach to implementing telemonitoring-enabled Supported HBPM interventions into real-world clinical settings. Our findings have the potential to inform how health systems can shift the paradigm of BP assessments from the office to the home.",

This project sought to determine if observation of PPE donning and doffing for detection of protocol violations by a virtual safety officer (VSO) was a feasible option to improve the safety of the workplace. Five healthcare workers with experience serving as safety officers were enrolled in a feasibility study in which they observed actors donning and doffing PPE in-person and noted errors using a curated checklist for documentation. One month later, the same participants viewed recordings of the in-person sessions and again recorded errors for seven trials. Five hundred and twenty-three responses recorded from the SOs across the in-person and virtual trials aligned 88.7% of the time. SOs were more accurate in the virtual setting than in the in-person setting (87.6% <i>vs</i>. 82.4%, respectively). However, Cohen's kappa showed lower inter-rater reliability when observing virtually than in-person, especially in the doffing steps of the protocol. A VSO may be a feasible option when assessing whether participants can correctly follow PPE donning and doffing protocols. Future work includes incorporating real-time observation, 360-degree cameras, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) to increase visualization, thereby increasing inter-rater reliability.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Inefficient patient flow in chemotherapy units is often caused by improper resource allocation, delays, and excessive workloads. Lean healthcare practices offer process visualization and waste reduction, addressing these issues. This project aims to optimize chemotherapy patient flow by improving care coordination, reducing waiting times, and shortening hospital stays.<h4>Methods</h4>The project employed Value Stream Mapping methodology from May 2022 to May 2023. The team mapped the chemotherapy administration process, identified inefficiencies, and evaluated factors influencing patient flow, including delays and resource utilization.<h4>Results</h4>Prior to the intervention, the percentage of value-added time from patient admission to discharge was 47.35%. After applying lean principles, the total hospital stay was reduced by 56.8%, treatment duration decreased by 31.57%, and unscheduled patient visits decreased by 22.93%. The evaluation of test results, chemotherapy drug transfer, and drug preparation processes were identified as the least efficient, with value-added time percentages of 12.87%, 17.12%, and 28.89%, respectively. The longest waiting time was recorded before the start of chemotherapy, averaging 72\u2009minutes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Lean practices were effective in reducing waiting times and hospital stays, improving patient flow. Key improvements included enhanced coordination, streamlined drug preparation, and reduced delays in patient assessments. The project is reinforced with field data, which enhances the applicability of the findings in clinical practice. The success and sustainability of these improvements are dependent on ongoing management support and the adoption of lean practices across the hospital. Implementing lean practices in high-volume units is recommended to further enhance operational efficiency.",

      "abstractText": "The human microbiome exerts tremendous influence on maintaining a balance between human health and disease. High-throughput sequencing has enabled the study of microbial communities at an unprecedented resolution. Generation of massive amounts of sequencing data has also presented novel challenges to analyzing and visualizing data to make biologically relevant interpretations. We have developed an interactive Metagenome Data Analysis and Visualization (MetaDAVis) tool for 16S rRNA as well as the whole genome sequencing data analysis and visualization to address these challenges using an R Shiny application. MetaDAVis can perform six different types of analyses that include: i) Taxonomic abundance distribution; ii) Alpha and beta diversity analyses; iii) Dimension reduction tasks using PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP; iv) Correlation analysis using taxa- or sample-based data; v) Heatmap generation; and vi) Differential abundance analysis. MetaDAVis creates interactive and dynamic figures and tables from multiple methods enabling users to easily understand their data using different variables. Our program is user-friendly and easily customizable allowing those without any programming background to perform comprehensive data analyses using a standalone or web-based interface.",

The secondary objective was to compare the performance of ACE-MBCA with gadobenate dimeglumine.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Three independent readers analyzed MRI examinations from a previously completed randomized crossover clinical trial in a blinded manner in a centralized setting. The study included 20 consecutive adult patients with known or suspected liver metastases, who received both ACE-MBCA and gadobenate dimeglumine. The readers evaluated 6 types of MRI scans (unenhanced, enhanced, and combined MRI for both contrast agents) with lesion visualization [lesion border delineation (LBD) and lesion contrast (LC)] as primary outcome. To maintain the blinded nature of the study, all statistical analyses were performed by an independent statistician who was not involved in the image reading process. Differences in primary outcomes were performed using 1-sided paired t tests at a significance level of 0.025 for both parameters. For secondary outcomes (ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI visualization, lesion detection, size measurements, reader confidence, quantitative parameters, and image quality were compared with that of the other scans), descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate differences between categories in comparative analyses, without formal hypothesis testing for most secondary endpoints.<h4>Results</h4>ACE-MBCA-enhanced MRI demonstrated statistically significant superior scoring over unenhanced MRI for visualizing focal liver lesions, with mean LBD scores improving from 1.8-2.3 to 2.4-2.9 and LC scores ranging from 1.8-2.3 to 2.8-3.3 across all 3 readers (P < 0.001). Compared with unenhanced MRI, ACE-MBCA detected significantly more lesions across all readers (mean differences 0.4-0.8 lesions, 95% CI: 0.04-1.52), particularly for small lesions (<1 cm), where detection improved from 2-6 to 3-12 lesions. Liver-to-lesion contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios were also significantly higher after ACE-MBCA enhancement. All visualization parameters of ACE-MBCA were comparable to those of gadobenate dimeglumine, with no significant differences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared with unenhanced MRI, ACE-MBCA MRI resulted in superior visualization and a greater number of detected liver lesions. ACE-MBCA and gadobenate dimeglumine performed similarly in the visualization and detection of colorectal liver metastases.",

      "abstractText": "The transition to minimally invasive spinal surgery over traditional open procedures requires the development of imaging techniques that meet the size constraints. Due to size restrictions associated with minimally invasive spine surgery, current imaging techniques are largely limited to microscopy, which is only capable of line-of-sight imaging of the tissue surface. A miniature, high-resolution ultrasound imaging endoscope has been developed as a potential alternative imaging method that would enable intra-operative guidance. We have designed and developed a 30 MHz miniature, 64-element, high-resolution imaging endoscope using PIN-PMT-PT single crystal as the piezoelectric substrate. The packaged probe had cross-sectional dimensions of 3.8 mm x 4.2 mm and a length of 14 cm. Two editions of the endoscope were created with a forward-facing and 40\u2070 angle to enable visualization of structures during a medial and lateral approach, respectively. The probe was combined with a custom imaging system that produced real-time images with a field of view ranging between \u00b132\u2070 and an image depth of 15 mm. The two-way axial resolution was measured to be 38 \u03bcm based on the -6 dB width of the pulse envelope. The -6 dB lateral resolution was measured to be 113 \u03bcm, 131 \u03bcm, and 158 \u03bcm at steering angles of 0\u2070, 12\u2070, and 25\u2070 respectively, which were close to the simulated values of 106 \u03bcm, 118 \u03bcm and 144 \u03bcm. Preliminary clinical imaging studies successfully demonstrated the visualization of pertinent spinal anatomy during minimally invasive surgeries. The imaging probe was also able to demonstrate compression and decompression of nerve roots, supporting its potential use as a clinical tool.",

To fill this gap, we have developed PlateletBase, a knowledge base aimed at enhancing the understanding and study of platelets and related diseases. Our team retrieved information from various public databases, specifically extracting and analyzing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 3711 samples across 41 different conditions available on the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI). PlateletBase offers six analytical and visualization tools, enabling users to perform gene similarity analysis, pair correlation, multi-correlation, expression ranking, clinical information association, and gene annotation for platelets. The current version of PlateletBase includes 10,278 genomic entries, 31,758 transcriptomic entries, 4869 proteomic entries, 2614 omics knowledge entries, 1833 drugs, 97 platelet resources, 438 diseases/traits, and six analysis modules. Each entry has been carefully curated and supported by experimental evidence. Additionally, PlateletBase features a user-friendly interface designed for efficient querying, manipulation, browsing, visualization, and analysis of detailed platelet protein and gene information. The case studies on gray platelet syndrome and angina pectoris demonstrate that PlateletBase is a suitable tool for identifying diagnostic biomarkers and exploring disease mechanisms, thereby advancing research in platelet functionality. PlateletBase is accessible at http://plateletbase.clinlabomics.org.cn/.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) can improve survival outcomes for individuals with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer and peritoneal disease (PD). Individuals with GI cancer and PD receiving CRS-HIPEC are at increased risk for malnutrition. Despite the increased risk for malnutrition, there has been limited study of nutritional interventions for individuals receiving CRS-HIPEC.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of Support Through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance (STRONG), a multilevel digital health intervention to improve nutritional management among individuals with GI cancer and PD receiving CRS-HIPEC. We also assessed patient-reported outcomes, including malnutrition risk, health-related quality of life, and weight-related measures.<h4>Methods</h4>STRONG is a 12-week digital intervention in which participants received biweekly nutritional counseling with a dietitian, logged food intake using a Fitbit tracker, and reported nutrition-related outcomes. Dietitians received access to a web-based dashboard and remotely monitored patients' reported food intake and nutrition-impact symptoms. Implementation outcomes were assessed against prespecified benchmarks consistent with benchmarks used in prior studies. Changes in patient-reported outcomes at baseline and follow-up were assessed using linear and ordered logistic regressions.<h4>Results</h4>Participants (N=10) had a median age of 57.5 (IQR 54-69) years. Feasibility benchmarks were achieved for recruitment (10/17, 59% vs benchmark: 50%), study assessment completion (9/10, 90% vs benchmark: 60%), dietitian appointment attendance (7/10, 70% vs benchmark: 60%), daily food intake logging adherence (6/10, 60% vs benchmark: 60%), and participant retention (10/10, 100% vs benchmark: 60%). Most participants rated the intervention as acceptable (8/10, 80% vs benchmark: 70%) and reported a high level of usability for dietitian services (10/10, 100%). The benchmark usability for the Fitbit tracker to log food intake was not met. Compared to baseline, participants saw on average a 6.0 point reduction in malnutrition risk score (P=.01), a 20.5 point improvement in general health-related quality of life score (P=.002), and a 5.6 percentage point increase in 1-month weight change (P=.04) at the end of the study.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The STRONG intervention demonstrated to be feasible, acceptable, and usable among individuals with GI cancer and PD receiving CRS-HIPEC. A fully powered randomized controlled trial is needed to test the effectiveness of STRONG for reducing malnutrition and improving patient outcomes.",

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time.<h4>Purpose</h4>Expanding access to pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing to veterans has been an emphasis in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA); using population dashboard tools (PDTs) may identify additional patients who qualify for testing. Involving pharmacy residents in PGx can help prepare them for precision medicine practice and more efficiently provide PGx care to patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Veterans treated in the outpatient setting at the Lt. Col. Luke Weathers, Jr. Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center from March 2023 to June 2024 were included in this study. Upon creation of a virtual PGx clinic, a PGx PDT was used to identify patients newly prescribed medications on the VA PGx gene testing panel. The clinic was driven by a postgraduate year 2 pharmacy resident with a preceptor overseeing the practice, and patients were contacted for consent and testing. The number and type of PGx gene variants identified were assessed, with results discussed with patients and recommendations made to providers.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 130 patients were screened, of whom 104 had PGx testing, corresponding to an 80% consent rate. Overall, 247 PGx gene variants were identified, including 149 informational and 78 actionable drug-gene variants, 18 variants indicating inheritable conditions, and 17 variants corresponding to phenoconversion. A total of 90 recommendations were made to providers, and patients had an average of 2.3 PGx-impacted medications prescribed. Of the actionable drug-gene variants, the majority were related to use of clopidogrel, statins, sertraline, and proton pump inhibitors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Novel use of a PDT was helpful in identifying patients qualifying for PGx testing. Creation of the resident-driven clinic resulted in PGx interventions for the majority of patients who underwent testing.",

      "abstractText": "This study employs a bibliometric analysis to examine the evolution and future trajectories in epigenetic modifications in neurology from 2004 to 2024. A total of 12,964 publications were scrutinized via the R bibliometrix package and VOSviewer for network visualization, complemented by Scimagp Graphica to elucidate global collaborative networks. Our extensive review reveals a significant growth in the field of epigenetic neurology studies, driven by an increased output of publications and evidenced by an enhanced focus on epigenetic modifications. The USA and McGill University are recognized as central contributors, with Nature leading as the most prolific journal and J. Mill and E.J. Nestler distinguishing themselves as key authors by publication volume and citation impact, respectively. A detailed keyword analysis highlighted \"expression,\" \"DNA methylation,\" \"brain,\" \"gene-expression,\" and \"gene\" as the most recurrent terms, indicating core areas of research concentration. Subsequent manual analysis due to software-detected inaccuracies reaffirmed Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and schizophrenia as predominant neurological diseases associated with epigenetic studies. Pathophysiological processes such as DNA methylation, oxidative stress, and synaptic plasticity have been extensively examined in relation to epigenetic modifications in neurology. Synthesis of the reference literature analysis identifies critical themes such as the role of glucocorticoid receptors, the significance of hydroxymethylcytosine in neural DNA, the implications of epigenetic patterns in mental health, and the impact of BDNF gene on memory consolidation. Emerging technologies and underexplored areas further highlight future directions. These insights into epigenetic research in neurology indicate a sustained and intensifying trajectory, hinting at expanding horizons for future therapeutic approaches and interventions. Our findings underscore an active and progressing interest in neurological epigenetics, suggesting a continued expansion and specialization in the exploration of epigenetic mechanisms and their clinical relevance.",

      "abstractText": "<b>BACKGROUND.</b> The low clinically approved doses of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) do not generate sufficient enhancement on CT for diagnostic purposes. Photon-counting detector (PCD) CT offers improved spectral resolution and could potentially enable visualization of hepatocyte-specific GBCAs, given their associated high gadolinium concentrations within hepatocytes. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of gadoxetate disodium in combination with PCD CT and low-energy virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) reconstructions to achieve an increase in attenuation in a phantom. <b>METHODS.</b> A series of solutions was prepared of diluted gadoxetate disodium (concentrations of 0.250-2.5 \u03bcmol/mL, corresponding with doses of 25-200 \u03bcmol/kg). These solutions, along with deionized water, were evaluated in an anthropomorphic abdominal phantom using a clinical PCD CT scanner; VMI reconstructions at 40, 50, 60, and 70 keV and virtual noncontrast (VNC) imaging reconstructions were generated. Attenuation measurements were obtained; a linear regression model combined these values with previously reported in vivo data to estimate hepatic enhancement and CNR across doses. <b>RESULTS.</b> Attenuation increased with increasing concentration at a given energy level and with decreasing energy level for a given concentration; VNC images had the lowest attenuation. The maximum attenuation reached in the abdominal phantom was 45.2 HU for a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcmol/mL at 40 keV. A concentration of 0.25 \u03bcmol/mL had attenuation at 40 keV of 13.0 HU. The model yielded estimated in vivo hepatic enhancement at 40 keV of 4.9 HU for a dose of 25 \u03bcmol/kg, 19.9 HU for 100 \u03bcmol/kg, and 30.8 HU for 200 \u03bcmol/kg; corresponding CNRs were 0.13, 0.52, and 0.81, respectively. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> The combination of gadoxetate disodium and PCD CT could theoretically allow appreciable hepatic enhancement at a 200-\u03bcmol/kg dose; such effect was not observed for the clinically approved 25-\u03bcmol/kg dose. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> PCD CT achieved attenuation increases for gadoxetate disodium at considerably lower doses than previously documented for CT of GBCAs, albeit at approximately eight times greater than clinical doses, which were thus too high for clinical use. Additional research exploiting PCD CT technology could seek to reduce further doses required for sufficient visualization into a clinically feasible range, to potentially allow CT using a liver-specific agent.",

      "abstractText": "Cerebral ultrasound is the preferred modality for evaluating the infant brain, offering real-time bedside assessment without exposure to ionizing radiation. Microvascular imaging ultrasound (MVI), an advanced Doppler technique, enables the visualization of microvascular slow-flow structures without the need for contrast agents. This innovative approach has the potential to provide valuable insights into the developing brain's vasculature and hemodynamics. The utility of MVI has been investigated in various neurological conditions affecting neonates and infants, demonstrating its promise as a complementary tool to existing imaging modalities. By providing detailed, real-time images of the brain's microvasculature, MVI can aid in the early detection, monitoring, and understanding of cerebral pathologies. In this review, we aim to present a comprehensive atlas of cerebral venous structures as visualized with MVI, serving as a reference for future research in this field and promoting the adoption of this technique in clinical practice for improved diagnosis and management of neurological conditions in the infant population.ABBREVIATIONS: MVI = Microvascular Imaging.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>Exploring the effectiveness of visually managed health education in reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with complete occlusion of chronic coronary arteries.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, 100 patients with chronic total occlusion of coronary arteries and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in cardiovascular medicine were included and divided into a test group and a control group with 50 patients in each group. Patients in the test group received health education based on visualization management, while patients in the control group received conventional health education. Relevant data were collected for further comparison. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and t-test and \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test were used to analyze the differences.<h4>Results</h4>After intervention, there were higher levels of antithrombin III (AT3) and activated partial prothrombin time (APTT), while lower levels of D-dimer (D-D), fibrinogen degradation product (FDP), fibrinogen (FBG), and thrombin time (TT) in the test group than those before intervention. The control group showed decreased AT3 and APTT, while increased D-D, FDP,TT and FBG levels (P\u2009<\u20090.05). After intervention, the levels of AT3 and APTT in the test group were higher than those in the control group, while the levels of D-D, FDP, FBG, and TT were lower than those in the latter control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, both groups of patients showed a decrease in Padua scores and an increase in prevention cognition scores after intervention (P\u2009<\u20090.05). After intervention, the Padua score of the test group was lower than that of the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The test group had higher compliance score (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and satisfaction (P\u2009<\u20090.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Visual management health education can effectively improve the effect of health education, increase patients' awareness, compliance and satisfaction with VTE prevention, reduce the risk of lower limb VTE, and improve the coagulation function of CTO patients during PCI.",

      "abstractText": "Early diagnosis of brain tumors is challenging due to their complexity and delicate structure. Conventional imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET are unable to provide detailed visualization of early-stage brain tumors. Early-stage detection of brain tumors is vital for enhancing patient outcomes and survival rates. So far, several scientists have dedicated their efforts to innovating advanced diagnostic probes to efficiently cross the BBB and selectively target brain tumors for optimal imaging. The integration of these techniques presents a viable pathway for non-invasive, accurate, and early-stage tumor identification. Herein, we provide a timely update on the various imaging probes and potential challenges for the diagnosis of early-stage brain tumors. Furthermore, this review highlights the significance of integrating advanced imaging probes for improving the early detection of brain tumors, ultimately enhancing treatment outcomes. Hopefully, this review will stimulate the interest of researchers to accelerate the development of new imaging probes and even their clinical translation for improving the early diagnosis of brain tumors.",

      "abstractText": "Acupuncture, rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), serves as a complementary and alternative therapeutic modality that involves the insertion of needles into specific body points to stimulate and treat a variety of conditions. Over time, acupuncture has garnered global acceptance, progressively addressing an increasing spectrum of medical disorders. The integration of nanotechnology holds considerable potential to improve drug delivery efficacy and broaden the scope of acupuncture's applications, providing novel opportunities for investigating the underlying principles of meridians and acupoints. A bibliometric analysis of the application of nanotechnology in acupuncture over the past two decades (2004-2024) highlights emerging research trends and focal points in the field. This article provides an overview of the history, biological mechanisms, preparation methods, and clinical research status of nanoacupuncture, with a focus on analyzing the applications of nanoacupuncture technology. Nanotechnology enables the visualization and imaging of meridians and acupoints, facilitating a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms behind acupuncture's therapeutic effects. Modified acupuncture needles incorporating nanotechnology can serve dual purposes: functioning as sensors for real-time monitoring of various physiological parameters, thereby supporting disease diagnosis and enhancing therapeutic efficacy through specialized interventions. Furthermore, nanotechnology-enhanced acupuncture needles can act as platforms for targeted drug delivery working in tandem with responsive nanoparticles for disease treatment. Despite its promising potential and clinical applicability, nanoacupuncture faces inherent limitations and challenges that must be addressed.",

Compared with conventional fusion surgery, transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) using BESS (BESS-TLIF) has the advantages of less bleeding, minimal postoperative pain, and faster recovery. This technical note highlights its application in managing complex conditions such as scar tissue adhesion, altered anatomy, and implant removal, common in reoperations. The method focuses on precise dissection, endoscopic visualization, and careful tissue handling to ensure effective decompression and stabilization. Three representative cases, including reoperations for recurrent disc herniation, adjacent segment disease (ASD) following prior fusion, and ASD with nonunion of the prior fusion site requiring fusion extension, were described. All three cases exhibited clinical improvement following surgery. BESS is an effective and safe method for spinal revision surgery not only in simple decompression surgery but also in cases that required fusion surgery. As BESS is advancing, its role in complex spinal surgeries is expected to expand, potentially setting new standards in minimally invasive spine surgery.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Lactylation is a newly discovered type of post-translational modification, primarily occurring on lysine (K) residues of both histones and non-histones to exert diverse effects on target proteins. Research has shown that lysine lactylation (Kla) modification is ubiquitous in different cells and participates in the determination of cell function and fate, as well as in the initiation and progression of various diseases. Precise identification of Kla sites is fundamental for elucidating their biological functions and uncovering their application potential.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we proposed a novel human Kla site predictor (named PBertKla) through curating a reliable benchmark dataset with proper sample length and sequence identity threshold to train a protein large language model with optimal hyperparameters. Extensive experimental results consistently demonstrated that our model possessed robust human Kla site prediction ability, achieving an AUC (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) value of over 0.880 on the independent validation data. Feature visualization analysis further validated the effectiveness of in feature learning and representation from Kla sequences. Moreover, we benchmarked PBertKla against other cutting-edge models on an independent testing dataset from different sources, highlighting its superiority and transferability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>All results indicated that PBertKla excelled as an automatic predictor of human Kla sites, and it would advance the investigation of lactylation modifications and their significance in health and disease.",

      "abstractText": "Digital Systems for Data Management (DSDM) have become a critical cornerstone in collaborative biomedical research and clinical trials involving multiple investigators, institutions, and populations. DSDM provide unique features that ensure that data meet the standards of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability). We herein present Lesionia, a DSDM designed to support the PEER518 consortium that aimed at developing new cutaneous leishmaniases (CL) diagnostics using samples and data collected from patients suspected of having CL in countries in the MENA region and West Africa. The consortium involved nine institutions across five countries: Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon, Mali, and the USA, and informally Scientists from Algeria and Nigeria. The guidelines on the data to be collected by the clinicians and biologists during the project were used for the development of a Questionnaire that served as a basis for the implementation of a dedicated web-based DSDM.Lesionia was developed and validated for the management and the analysis of clinical and epidemiological data in the diagnosis of CL. It consists of a relational database, a web-based user interface (WUI) and a tool for experimental data handling and analysis of clinical and epidemiological data of CL cases. The platform was deployed and validated during the PEER518 project using data collected across the involved teams. Lesionia is expandable to include further collaborators, partners, and projects. It is designed for data handling from the consented patient interview and sample collection to the samples' storage and investigation. The WUI permits data entry, fetching, visualization and analysis. Rigorous controls on data entry were implemented to reduce discrepancies. It also offers a set of analysis tools that range from descriptive statistics to variable correlation analysis. Lesionia is accessible in a secure manner to all users of the consortium through a web browser.Lesionia will be a valuable tool for collaborative and integrative management of clinical and epidemiological data. It is an open-source software that can broadly serve the scientific community interested in studying, controlling, reporting, and diagnosing CL and similar cutaneous diseases.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Mitochondria are essential organelles for many aspects of cellular homeostasis. They play an indispensable role in the development and progression of diseases, particularly cancer which is a major cause of death worldwide. We analyzed the scientific research output on mitochondria and cancer via PubMed and Web of Science over the period 1990-2023.<h4>Methods</h4>Bibliometric analysis was performed by extracting data linking mitochondria to cancer pathogenesis over the period 1990-2023 from the PubMed database which has a precise and specific search engine. Only articles and reviews were considered. Since PubMed does not support analyses by countries or institutions, we utilized InCites, an analytical tool developed and marketed by Clarivate Analytics. We also used the VOSviewer software developed by the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (Bibliometric Department of Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands), which enables us to graphically represent links between countries, authors or keywords in cluster form. Finally, we used iCite, a tool developed by the NIH (USA) to access a dashboard of bibliometrics for papers associated with a portfolio. This module can therefore be used to measure whether the research carried out is still basic, translational or clinical.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 169,555 publications were identified in PubMed relating to 'mitochondria', of which 34,949 (20.61%) concerned 'mitochondria' and 'dysfunction' and 22,406 (13.21%) regarded 'mitochondria' and 'cancer'. Hence, not all mitochondrial dysfunctions may lead to cancer or enhance its progression. Qualitatively, the disciplines of journals were classified into 166 categories among which cancer specialty accounts for only 4.7% of publications. Quantitatively, our analysis showed that cancer/neoplasms in the liver (2569 articles) were placed in the first position. USA occupied the first position among countries contributing the highest number of publications (5695 articles), whereas Egypt came in the thirty-eight position with 84 publications (0.46%). Importantly, USA is the first-ranked country having both the top 1% and 10% impact indicators with 207 and 1459 articles, respectively. By crossing the query 'liver neoplasms' (155,678) with the query 'mitochondria' (169,555), we identified 1336 articles in PubMed over the study period. Among these publications, research areas were classified into 65 categories with the highest percentage of documents included in biochemistry and molecular biology (28.92%), followed by oncology (23.31%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study underscores the crucial yet underrepresented role of mitochondria in cancer research. Despite their significance in cancer pathogenesis, the proportion of related publications remains relatively low. Our findings highlight the need for further research to deepen our understanding of mitochondrial mechanisms in cancer, which could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies.",

The use of large PEEK cage in lumbar interbody fusion has gained attention owing to their potential biomechanical advantages. Despite the potential benefits of BELIF with large PEEK cages, studies on its effectiveness and safety are lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>Twelve consecutive patients underwent single-level BELIF for lumbar degenerative disease. The technique involves two small portals, one each for endoscopy and instruments. A large PEEK cage was inserted through a posterolateral approach. Clinical outcomes, including a Visual Analog Scale for back and leg pain, the Oswestry Disability Index, and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Fusion status was evaluated using computed tomography (CT) at 12 months.<h4>Results</h4>The mean patient age was 69.1\u00b17.2 years, with operations predominantly at the L4-5 level (83%). The mean operation time was 149.7\u00b137.4 minutes, and the average surgical drainage was 201.4\u00b159.7 mL. All clinical outcome measures showed significant improvement at 12 months (p<0.05). Fusion was achieved in 83.3% of patients. Cage subsidence (>1 mm) occurred in one patient (8.3%). Complications included one case each of incidental durotomy, wrong-site surgery, and wound dehiscence and three cases of asymptomatic hematoma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BELIF using a large PEEK cage demonstrated promising clinical outcomes and fusion rates. The technique offers enhanced visualization and enables direct neural decompression while minimizing tissue trauma. The use of a large PEEK cage may contribute to improved stability and reduced subsidence risk.",

      "abstractText": "Fluorescent dyes are widely applied in clinical diagnosis, detection and treatment of diseases. Several image probes such as ICG, MB, and 5-ALA have been approved by FDA. However, the limited tumor-targeting capability of these dyes hinders their effectiveness in oncological imaging. Currently, various ligand-based targeting probes have been developed to minimize nonspecific background emission. BRAF, especially BRAF V600E, is a common cancer gene and undergoes frequent mutation in melanoma. Small molecular BRAF kinase inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of melanoma patients carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, including Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib and so on. Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as an important fluorescent class has been investigated extensively. Vemurafenib-BODIPY has been reported to visualize BRAF V600E mutated cancer cells. Herein, we report our designed BODIPY-based Vemurafenib derivatives targeting BRAF for cancer cell imaging. The fluorescent probes were characterized and evaluated of photophysical properties, targeted binding and live cell imaging. Compound 1a exhibited promising fluorescence imaging ability. To improve fluorescence quantum yield, structural optimization was performed by incorporating meso N,N'-dialkyl-substituted amides to BODIPY core. Compound 1d showed excellent fluorescence properties and nice binding affinity. It allowed visualization of BRAF V600E mutated cancer cells at low concentrations.",

      "abstractText": "Unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) has revolutionized minimally invasive spinal surgery, offering enhanced visualization and reduced recovery times. However, the steep learning curve and technical complexity require a structured training framework. This narrative review proposes a 10-tier difficulty progression framework for UBE designed to guide novice surgeons through incremental skill acquisition. Each tier corresponds to specific procedures with escalating challenges spanning lumbar, cervical, and thoracic pathologies. The proposed framework begins with foundational lumbar procedures, such as ipsilateral recess decompression and discectomy, and advances to more intricate techniques, such as transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Transitioning to the cervical and thoracic regions requires mastery of earlier tiers, emphasizing precision in handling delicate anatomical structures. These challenges include achieving proficiency in mobilizing nerve roots, minimizing spinal cord manipulation, and mastering advanced decompression techniques. Evidence from learning curve analyses, including cumulative sum methodologies, underscores the importance of tailored training to reduce complications and optimize outcomes. By standardizing the progression of UBE procedures, this framework aims to enhance surgical safety, improve patient outcomes, and facilitate their widespread adoption. Future research should focus on validating this framework by using clinical trials, training feedback, and long-term patient data. Ultimately, this 10-tiered approach provides a roadmap for mastering UBE, addressing the growing demand for minimally invasive spinal surgery with precision and confidence.",

Therefore, analyzing the effectiveness of MSCs in the literature is highly important for building relevant knowledge networks and promoting development in this field.<h4>Methods</h4>The Web of Science database was selected as the source of literature, and all the literature on MSCs in diabetes from January 1, 2000, to October 18, 2023, was selected. After screening, CiteSpace and VOSviewer were imported into bibliometric software to construct the knowledge visualization map. Journal analysis, author analysis, country/region analysis, reference analysis, and keyword analysis were performed.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 2912 articles and reviews were included. The number of articles on the use of MSCs for the treatment of diabetes is increasing annually. These publications originate mainly from 90 countries and 278 institutions, of which China and the United States were the top producers. We identified 15384 authors, with Liu Jiejie having the largest number of articles and Shapiro Amj being the most frequently co-cited. Stem Cell Res Ther was the most studied journal, and Diabetes was the most frequently cited journal. After analysis, the most common keywords were MSCs, diabetes mellitus, expression, transplantation, and differentiation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Research into MSC-based interventions for diabetes is booming. In the future, cooperation and connections between various countries and institutions should be strengthened. MSCinduced differentiation into insulin-producing cells, MSCs homing in vivo, the therapeutic effect of MSCs on diabetic nephropathy, and the therapeutic effect of exosomes secreted by MSCs constitute the current research hotspots and development trends for future research.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>A significant challenge in precision medicine is confidently identifying mutations detected in sequencing processes that play roles in disease treatment or diagnosis. Furthermore, the lack of representativeness of single nucleotide variants in public databases and low sequencing rates in underrepresented populations pose defies, with many pathogenic mutations still awaiting discovery. Mutational pathogenicity predictors have gained relevance as supportive tools in medical decision-making. However, significant disagreement among different tools regarding pathogenicity identification is rooted, necessitating manual verification to confirm mutation effects accurately.<h4>Results</h4>This article presents a cross-platform mobile application, DTreePred, an online visualization tool for assessing the pathogenicity of nucleotide variants. DTreePred utilizes a machine learning-based pathogenicity model, including a decision tree algorithm and 15 machine learning classifiers alongside classical predictors. Connecting public databases with diverse prediction algorithms streamlines variant analysis, whereas the decision tree algorithm enhances the accuracy and reliability of variant pathogenicity data. This integration of information from various sources and prediction techniques aims to serve as a functional guide for decision-making in clinical practice. In addition, we tested DTreePred in a case study involving a cohort from Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. By categorizing nucleotide variants from the list of oncogenes and suppressor genes classified in ClinVar as inexact data, DTreePred successfully revealed the pathogenicity of more than 95% of the nucleotide variants. Furthermore, an integrity test with 200 known mutations yielded an accuracy of 97%, surpassing rates expected from previous models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DTreePred offers a robust solution for reducing uncertainty in clinical decision-making regarding pathogenic variants. Improving the accuracy of pathogenicity assessments has the potential to significantly increase the precision of medical diagnoses and treatments, particularly for underrepresented populations.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background and purpose</h4>To establish predictive models for radiation-induced hypoglossal neuropathy (RIHN) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Data from 423 NPC patients receiving IMRT-based treatment were retrospectively reviewed. They were randomly (3:2) divided into a training set (n\u202f=\u202f256) and a testing set (n\u202f=\u202f167). Dosimetric variables were selected by penalized regression and machine learning, with area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) calculated. Clinical variables were selected by the competitive risk analysis. A competitive risk model including clinical and dosimetric variables was performed, and a nomogram was generated as a visualization of the model to predict the incidence of RIHN.<h4>Results</h4>During a median follow-up of 102\u202fmonths (IQR: 89.5 to 112.9\u202fmonths), the cumulative incidence of RIHN at 3, 5, and 8 years were 2.1\u202f%, 5.4\u202f%, and 10.5\u202f%, respectively. D<sub>1cc</sub> and aV<sub>75</sub> were the most predictive dosimetric variables. The dose-effect curve plotted with D<sub>1cc</sub> indicated the tolerance dose for a 5\u202f% probability of developing RIHN in 8\u202fyears (TD5/8) was 77.3\u202fGy (EQD<sub>2</sub>). The restricted cubic spline between aV<sub>75</sub> and RIHN indicated a volume threshold of 0.81\u202fcm<sup>3</sup>. A competitive risk model including hypoglossal canal involvement, concurrent chemotherapy, D<sub>1cc</sub>, and aV<sub>75</sub> was established, with the C-index of the training set and testing set being 0.726 and 0.691, respectively. The nomogram-defined high-risk group had the higher RIHN incidences in the training and testing sets.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identified the most critical dosimetric predictors, which is expected to become a feasible dose constraint for hypoglossal nerves in radiation plan. Combining dosimetric and clinical predictors, we further proposed and validated the first nomogram model to quantify the risk of RIHN, contributing to identifying high-risk patients and early intervention. Further multicenter studies are needed to validate or complement our findings.",

Patients were scanned on a dual-source PCD-CT using standard acquisition mode with collimation of 144\u2009\u00d7\u20090.4\u00a0mm or ultra-high-resolution (UHR) mode with collimation of 120\u2009\u00d7\u20090.2\u00a0mm. Tube voltages were set at 120 or 140\u00a0kV. Scans were reconstructed using a standard kernel (Bv48), with UHR scans also reconstructed using a sharper kernel (Bv56).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 25 patients were included in the study, of whom 80% were male, with a mean age of 68\u2009\u00b1\u20098 years (IQR 64.8-75.3). UHR mode, particularly with Bv56 kernels, provided significantly thinner vessel walls and reduced beam hardening artifacts compared to standard mode and Bv48 kernel, especially at lower tube voltages. Noise levels varied, with generally lower noise in UHR scans.<h4>Conclusion</h4>UHR mode with Bv56 kernels improves artifact reduction and vessel visualization in coronary stents, offering advantages over standard CCTA protocols. These findings may enhance the clinical diagnosis of ISR, leading to better patient outcomes through improved treatment planning.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>To investigate whether spindle visualization using polarized light microscopy (PLM) can assist in identifying unfertilized oocytes prior to early rescue intracytoplasmic sperm injection (R-ICSI).<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study included 356 early R-ICSI cycles, of which 24 were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 332 cycles were divided into study group and control group based on whether spindle observation had been performed before early R-ICSI. The fertilization rate, embryo development, and clinical outcome were compared between the two groups.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 356 participants included, 332 completed follow-up analysis. The study group demonstrated a significantly higher normal fertilization rate (82.55% vs. 71.49%, P\u2009< 0.01) and a lower 3PN rate (3.17% vs. 8.89%, P\u2009< 0.01) after following R-ICSI. For oocytes without visible spindles in the study group or those with fragmented polar bodies in the control group, in vitro fertilization (IVF) was performed, resulting in a higher normal fertilization rate in the study group (53.37% vs. 36.43%, P\u2009< 0.01). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of embryo development and implantation potential. In the high-age subgroup (over 35 years old), the normal cleavage rate was significantly higher in the spindle examination group compared to the non-observation group (38.60% vs. 22.47%, P\u2009< 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Utilizing PLM for spindle observation can effectively identify oocytes suitable for early R-ICSI to improve fertilization outcomes and optimize embryo development in women over 35 years old.",

      "abstractText": "Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds great promise for applications in cancer treatment, it has limited effectiveness against deep hypoxic tumors. Moreover, the lack of visualization guidance for precision theranostics poses additional challenges, hindering its broader clinical adoption. By combining NIR-IIc (1800\u00a0nm) imaging guidance with internally and externally activatable dual-modality PDT and hypoxia-triggered chemotherapy, this study proposes a conceptual framework to overcome these limitations. This approach involves the use of photoswitchable lanthanide-doped nanoparticles featuring Tm<sup>3+</sup>-activated upconversion/downshifting emissions coupled with carboxyl-terminated Ir(III) complex-based Type I/II photosensitizer to form a nanophotosensitizer. The findings demonstrate that this system enabled NIR-IIc imaging guidance upon 808/980\u00a0nm excitation while selectively activating external PDT under 980\u00a0nm irradiation, thereby ensuring accurate therapy and minimizing phototoxicity risk. The Ir(III) complex conjugates with luminol to form a self-illuminating Type I/II photosensitizer, which can respond to the elevated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in the tumor microenvironment, effectively catalyzing chemiluminescence-assisted PDT. Moreover, PDT aggravates tumor hypoxia, which in turn activates the hypoxia-activatable prodrugs like tirapazamine, resulting in a synergistic antitumor effect. With NIR-IIc imaging-guided dual-modality PDT, this study introduces a groundbreaking approach that unites Type I/II PDT with chemotherapy, significantly advancing the precise and effective treatment of deep hypoxic tumors.",

      "abstractText": "Despite significant efforts, undernutrition remains a critical public health issue, particularly in developing countries like Ethiopia. Anthropometric failure, which indicates inadequate child growth and development, has severe consequences. Analyzing the spatial distribution and determinants of anthropometric failure is crucial for evaluating and improving nutritional programs. Understanding these spatial patterns can enhance targeted resource allocation, thereby accelerating progress toward optimal child growth. This study utilized a spatial analysis of anthropometric failure using data from the EMDHS 2019, focusing on a weighted sample of 3,659 children under five. The survey was conducted from March 21, 2019, to June 28, 2019, following a two-stage stratified sampling. Non-spatial analysis was conducted using STATA version 17, while ArcGIS Pro and SatScan version 9.6 were used for spatial visualization. Multiscale geographically weighted regression analysis identified significant determinants, with statistical significance set at a p-value of less than 0.05. The prevalence of anthropometric failure among the sampled children was 36.79% (95% CI 35.22%-38.37%). A clustered distribution was observed (Moran's I\u2009=\u20090.249, p\u2009<\u20090.001), with significant clustering in the Amhara, Tigray, Afar, and Somali regions. Children in these clusters were twice as likely to experience anthropometric failure (RR\u2009=\u20092.01, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Key determinants of spatial variation included mothers with no formal education (Mean\u2009=\u20090.1402, p\u2009<\u20090.001), low household wealth (Mean\u2009=\u20090.1651, p\u2009=\u20090.002), short birth intervals (Mean\u2009=\u20090.1165, p\u2009=\u20090.014), and insufficient postnatal care (Mean\u2009=\u20090.0589, p\u2009=\u20090.004). With a prevalence of 36.79%, anthropometric failure among children under five in Ethiopia is a major concern. The observed clustering highlights the need for targeted interventions, including improving maternal education, increasing household wealth, and enhancing access to family planning and postnatal care. Special emphasis should be placed on hotspot areas to effectively address and reduce undernutrition.",

      "abstractText": "Children generally face a higher incidence of airway management complications, intubation difficulties, and the risk of failed intubation. Currently, there is sufficient evidence in clinical practice for the use of videolaryngoscopes in pediatric airway management. However, there are a number of standard-blade videolaryngoscopes available for children. In addition, there is no clear recommendation on which videolaryngoscope is superior. The primary objective of this study is to compare the first pass success rate and the Percentage of Glottic Opening (POGO) scores with Cormack-Lehane (CML) scores obtained through direct and indirect laryngoscopy with HugeMed and McGrath Mac videolaryngoscopes in pediatric patients with an unanticipated, difficult airway. Following the Ethics Committee approval and written parental consents, a total of 40 elective surgical patients, aged 3 and under, with ASA 1-3 risk classification, and undergoing general anesthesia, were included in the study. After induction of general anesthesia, the first group of patients (Group McGrath, n = 20) was intubated with the McGrath Mac videolaryngoscope, and the second group (Group HugeMed, n = 20) with the HugeMed videolaryngoscope. Before intubation, CML and POGO scores were recorded for both groups using direct and indirect laryngoscopy with videolaryngoscopes. Intubation time, number of attempts, need for cricoid pressure, optimization maneuver requirement, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded for both groups. There was no significant difference between groups in demographic data including age, gender, body mass index, ASA, and hemodynamic parameters. A significant improvement was observed in CML and POGO scores using indirect laryngoscopy (p < 0.001). CML scores obtained with the McGrath Mac were significantly lower than the HugeMed Group (p = 0.0034). The mean POGO value calculated with indirect laryngoscopy was significantly higher in the McGrath Group compared to the HugeMed Group (92.63 \u00b1 6.09 vs. 88.75 \u00b1 4.44, respectively). Videolaryngoscopes improved laryngeal visualization in children under 3 years old. Compared to HugeMed, in indirect laryngoscopy, the McGrath Mac videolaryngoscope was found to be superior, with better CML and POGO scores. However, number of tracheal intubation attempts, success rate, complication risk, and hemodynamic parameters did not show any significant difference between the groups. Clinical trial registration number was NCT06484517.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Magnetic resonance (MR) images have been applied in diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine to improve the visualization and characterization of soft tissues and tumors. However, the physical density (\u03c1) and elemental composition of human tissues required for dosimetric calculation cannot be directly converted from MR images, obstructing MR-based personalized internal dosimetry. In this study, we proposed a method to derive physical densities from Dixon MR images for voxel-based internal dose calculation.<h4>Methods</h4>The proposed method defined human tissues as composed of four basic tissues. The physical densities of the human tissues were calculated using the standard tissue composition of the basic tissues and the volume fraction maps calculated from Dixon images. The derived \u03c1 map was applied to calculate the whole-body internal dosimetry using a multiple voxel S-value (MSV) approach. The accuracy of the proposed method in deriving \u03c1 and calculating the internal dose of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging was evaluated by comparing with those obtained from computed tomography (CT) images of the same patient and was compared with those obtained using generative adversarial networks (GANs).<h4>Results</h4>The proposed method was superior to the GANs in deriving \u03c1 from Dixon MR images and the following internal dose calculation. On average of a validation set, the mean absolute percent errors (MAPEs) of the whole-body \u03c1 derivation and internal dose calculation using the proposed method were 14.28\u2009\u00b1\u200911.11% and 3.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69%, respectively. The MAPEs were respectively reduced to 5.97\u2009\u00b1\u20092.51 and 2.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69% after excluding the intestinal gas with different locations in the Dixon MR and CT images.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed method could be applied for accurate and efficient personalized internal dosimetry evaluation in MR-integrated nuclear medicine clinical applications.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>At the time of its origination, endoscopic spine surgery (ESS) was introduced to advance minimally invasive spine surgical (MISS) techniques, aiming to reduce tissue traumatization and improve clinical outcomes. Initially, ESS was primarily applied to transforaminal diskectomies for treating low back pain and radiculopathy caused by lateral or posterolateral disc herniations. Early challenges included limited visualization, suboptimal camera systems, and restricted maneuverability of rigid endoscopes. Technological advancements, such as angled endoscopes and interlaminar approaches, have led to a broader adoption of ESS, particularly in Asian countries. As ESS gains traction in the United States, its potential applications continue to expand. This systematic review evaluates the safety and efficacy of ESS in the treatment of spinal column tumors.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic search across three databases following PRISMA guidelines to identify studies describing the use of spinal endoscopy for procedural or diagnostic management (e.g., biopsy) of spinal and vertebral column tumors, including both primary neoplasms and metastatic lesions. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and relevant data were extracted for qualitative synthesis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 24 studies, encompassing 147 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The most commonly treated tumor types included schwannomas (37.4\u00a0%), spinal metastases (15.0\u00a0%), meningiomas (7.5\u00a0%), and osteoid osteomas (6.8\u00a0%). Tumors were most frequently located in the lumbar spine (38.8\u00a0%), followed by the thoracic (29.9\u00a0%), cervical (12.9\u00a0%), craniospinal junction (6.8\u00a0%), and sacral regions (6.1\u00a0%). Surgical outcomes demonstrated a high rate of neurological improvement (100\u00a0%) across all cases. Among studies reporting pain scores, postoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores showed consistent improvement. The mean follow-up duration was 13.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1\u00a0months. Complication rates were low (6.8\u00a0%), with transient radiculopathy, pseudomeningocele, and postoperative hematoma among the reported adverse events. The overall mortality rate was 10.9\u00a0%, primarily reflecting patients with metastatic disease rather than procedure-related deaths.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ESS has demonstrated its utility as a viable and effective option for managing select spinal metastases and intradural-extramedullary tumors of the spinal column. The technique offers minimally invasive access to tumors with low complication rates and meaningful clinical benefits, particularly for frail patients requiring palliative treatment. Future studies with larger cohorts and comparative analyses are needed to further validate ESS as a mainstream approach in spinal oncology.",

We hypothesized that in acute heart failure (AHF), diuretic efficacy is associated with peripheral lymph flow.<h4>Methods and results</h4>We prospectively studied AHF patients who received protocolized diuretics followed by assessment of lower limb flow using indocyanine green lymphangiography (a validated method for visualization of lymphatic drainage). The lymph flow was defined as 'present' when it reached the ankle and 'significant' when it reached >10\u2009cm within 10\u2009min of dye injection, respectively. Based on diuretic efficacy (defined as cumulative diuresis and weight loss), patients were classified as diuretic responders vs. non-responders. Overall, 65 patients (mean age: 67\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, median [Q1-Q3] N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide: 6901 [4478-12\u2009723] pg/ml) were examined. There were 43 (66%) diuretic responders and 22 (34%) non-responders who did not differ in baseline clinical/laboratory characteristics. Among the responders, there were more patients with lymph flow either 'present' or 'significant' (95% vs. 73% and 88% vs. 45% vs non-responders, respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Responders had significantly longer median distance lymph reached within 10\u2009min (50 [24-75] vs. 10 [3-38] cm; p\u2009<\u20090.0005). There was a significant association between lymph flow and 6-h diuresis with \u03b2 (standard error) of 0.45 (0.13) (p\u2009<\u20090.005). In the multivariable analyses, lymph flow distance (odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.03) independently predicted diuretic efficacy (p\u2009<\u20090.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>For the first time, faster lower limb lymph flow was linked with better diuretic efficacy in AHF. Studies are needed to determine whether the lymphatic system can become a therapeutic target for decongestion.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Study design</h4>Expanding upon established surgical simulation methods, we developed a fused deposition modeling three-dimensional (3D)-printed model of the C1-T1 vertebra for posterior cervical foraminotomy training that features silicone-based neural elements, polyurethane foam-based ligaments, and polyethylene terephthalate glycol vertebrae.<h4>Purpose</h4>This study evaluated the effectiveness of a cost-efficient 3D-printed training model designed to help neurosurgical residents acquire fundamental skills in endoscopic posterior cervical foraminotomy while addressing the technique's challenging learning curve and limited training resources.<h4>Overview of literature</h4>Only a few studies have investigated the efficacy of such a model.<h4>Methods</h4>Eight neurosurgery residents each with over 2 years of training completed four training sessions on two randomly assigned cervical spine levels using the newly developed 3D-printed model. A simple plumbing endoscope was used for real-time surgical visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 64 completed surgical levels, left-sided procedures showed significantly higher insufficient decompression rates than did right-sided procedures (25.0% vs. 3.6%, p=0.002). However, no significant difference in overall complication rates was observed between sides (p=0.073). Surgical parameters remained consistent across sides, with no significant differences in operative duration. Brunner-Langer analysis revealed substantial improvements in operative duration (mean duration decrease from 21:42\u00b12:15 to 6:33\u00b10:42 minutes, p=0.004) and total complications (mean decrease from 2.1\u00b10.8 to 0.4\u00b10.5, p=0.007) across sessions. Although fluoroscopy timing showed marginal improvement (mean duration decrease from 2:12\u00b11:15 to 0:55\u00b10:23 minutes, p=0.057), the number of fluoroscopic images tended to decrease.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings suggest that this novel 3D-printed cervical spine model could be a viable, low-cost option for neurosurgical training programs aiming to help residents develop essential endoscopic skills in a controlled setting. Facilitating early proficiency in posterior cervical foraminotomy can serve as a valuable intermediate step before transitioning to cadaveric models and clinical practice.",

However, differentiating benign and malignant lesions remains challenging, particularly for foci. Studies evaluating other lesion types have identified ultrafast MRI (UFMRI) parameters associated with malignancy. <b>OBJECTIVE</b> - The purpose of this study was to determine if kinetic features of UFMRI can differentiate malignant and nonmalignant foci. <b>METHODS</b> - In this single-center retrospective study, consecutive UFMRI examinations performed from July 2019 to April 2023 with subsequent MRI-guided biopsy of a focus were selected. Patient characteristics and lesion features were collected from the EMR, imaging reports, and imaging review. Focus and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) time to enhancement (TTE), and the difference between them was calculated. Associations with malignancy were assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression. <b>RESULTS</b> - A total of 124 patients (mean age, 53 years old; range, 29-78 years old) underwent biopsy of 124 foci. Sixty-four (51.6%) were postmenopausal, 71 (57.3%) had a personal history of breast cancer, 81 (65.3%) had a family history of breast cancer, and 33/94 (35.3%) had genetic mutations. Most examinations were performed for extent of disease evaluation (47.6%; 59/124), followed by screening (41.9%; 52/124). Patients predominantly had heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue (58.1%; 72/124) and mild BPE (57.3%; 71/124). Of 124 lesions, 21 (16.9%) were malignant, 16 were invasive, and five were ductal carcinoma in situ. Odds of malignancy increased 5% with each 1-second increase in the difference of lesion TTE and BPE TTE (95% CI: 2-9%, p = .006). Older age and lower BPE were associated with increased likelihood of malignancy (p = .005 and p = .02, respectively). Odds of malignancy for patients with minimal or mild BPE were 11.69 times the odds of those with moderate or marked BPE (95% CI: 1.51-90.67). No other demographic or lesion characteristics were predictive of malignancy. <b>CONCLUSION</b> - Earlier visualization of a focus relative to BPE on UFMRI was associated with increased likelihood of malignancy; morphologic features showed no association with malignancy. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT</b> - The difference of TTE of a focus compared with that of BPE may be a useful parameter for assessing malignancy, which could help reduce unnecessary biopsies.",

Participants were pathologically confirmed as HER2-low (immunohistochemistry score of 1\u2009+\u2009or 2\u2009+\u2009without HER2 gene amplification on in situ hybridization). PET/CT images were acquired 3.5\u00a0h after injection of 200 MBq of Al<sup>18</sup>F-NOTA-HER2-BCH. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and target-to-background ratios (TBR) were used to quantify tracer uptake.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-two participants with HER2-low breast cancer (mean age, 53.0\u2009\u00b1\u200911.0; 52 females) underwent Al<sup>18</sup>F-NOTA-HER2-BCH and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT with paired tumor biopsies. No adverse events occurred. The median SUVmax and TBR of 52 HER2-low biopsy lesions on Al<sup>18</sup>F-NOTA-HER2-BCH PET/CT were lower than that on <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT (6.6 vs. 10.5, P\u2009<.001; 8.0 vs. 10.6, P\u2009=.009). A total of 269 suspicious lesions were detected, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT depicted more suspected HER2-low positive lesions in breast (100% vs. 100%), chest wall (100% vs. 100%), lymph node (83.9% vs. 77.7%), bone (100% vs. 93.2%), liver (66.7% vs. 52.4%) and lung (86.7% vs. 75.0%) than Al<sup>18</sup>F-NOTA-HER2-BCH PET/CT. Additionally, clear interindividual and intraindividual differences on Al<sup>18</sup>F-NOTA-HER2-BCH tracer uptake was noted between participants, between different metastases in the same participants, even within different organ systems.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The visualization of HER2-low breast cancer with Al<sup>18</sup>F-NOTA-HER2-BCH PET/CT was feasible and safe. The observed intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity in the uptake of Al<sup>18</sup>F-NOTA-HER2-BCH indicates its potential use as a noninvasive tool for assessing disease heterogeneity and identifying patients who may derive clinical benefit from HER2-targeted therapies.",

      "abstractText": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is used for stroke prevention in AF, but it also increases bleeding risk. Clinical guidelines do not definitively recommend for or against OAC for patients with borderline stroke risk. Decision-making may benefit from values clarification exercises to communicate risk trade-offs. This study aimed to evaluate if a visual with a values clarification alters the understanding of the trade-offs of anticoagulation in AF. Participants aged 45-64 years were recruited across the United States via an online survey. While answering the survey, they were asked to imagine they were newly diagnosed with AF with a CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure; hypertension; age \u226575 years [doubled]; type 2 diabetes; previous stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism [doubled]; vascular disease; age 65 to 75 years; and sex category) score of 1 for men and 2 for women. Eligibility criteria included no diagnosis of AF and no prior OAC use. Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: (1) standard text-based information only (n=255), (2) visual aids showing stroke-risk probabilities (n=218), or (3) visual aids plus a values clarification exercise (visual+VC; n=200). Participants were subrandomized within the 2 visual-based groups to view either a gauge display or an icon array representing stroke risk. All participants read a hypothetical scenario of being newly diagnosed with AF and hypertension. The primary outcome was decision confidence as measured by the SURE (Sure of Myself; Understand Information; Risk-Benefit Ratio; Encouragement) test. Secondary measures included participants' perceived stroke risk reduction, worry about stroke or bleeding, and likelihood to choose OAC. A total of 673 participants completed the survey. The overall SURE test was 61.2% (156/255) for the standard, 66.5% (145/218) for the visual, and 67% (134/200) for the visual+VC group (visual vs standard P=.23; visual+VC vs standard P=.20). Participants were less likely to choose OAC in the visual groups (standard: mean 58.3, SD 30; visual: mean 51.4, SD 32; visual+VC: 51.9, SD 28; P=.03). Participants felt the reduction in stroke risk from an OAC was less in the visual groups (standard: mean 63.8, SD 22; visual: mean 54.2, SD 28; visual+VC: mean 58.6, SD 25; P<.001). Visualization methods (gauge vs icon array) showed no significant differences in overall SURE test results. Participants were less likely to choose OAC and perceived a smaller stroke risk reduction with gauge than icon array (OAC choice: gauge 48.8, icon array 55.4; P=.03; stroke risk reduction: gauge 52.1, icon array 60.4; P=.001). Visual aids can modestly affect decision confidence and perceptions regarding the benefits of OAC but do not significantly alter decision certainty in a scenario where the guidelines do not recommend for or against OAC. Future work should determine the role of a gauge versus icon array visual for decision-making in stroke prevention in AF.",
