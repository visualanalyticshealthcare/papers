      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Digital dashboards are widely employed across healthcare settings to present data, supporting timely risk identification and enhancing clinical decision-making. Incorporating feedback from end-users into dashboard design supports their uptake and utilisation. The current study aimed to: (a) understand how healthcare professionals working in residential aged care gather, interpret, transfer and communicate clinical information especially for falls management; and (b) utilise co-design methods to determine healthcare professionals' preferences for presentation, content and functionality of a digital falls dashboard to support delivery of care in residential aged care.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants were recruited via aged care provider and primary health network contacts. Individual interviews with general practitioners (GPs) (n\u2009=\u20093) explored end-user needs including information needs for falls management, decision-making processes, and dashboard preferences. Dashboard prototypes were developed using the interview findings and published guidelines. Prototypes were then presented for feedback in eight workshops (n\u2009=\u200920 participants; residential aged care staff, GPs, and geriatricians) completed via videoconferencing or in-person to gain feedback. Interview and workshop transcripts were analysed using template analysis.<h4>Results</h4>During interviews, GPs discussed difficulties in accessing aged care resident information, clinical decision-making in residential aged care, and use of decision support. During workshops, healthcare professionals shared feedback on the design, content, and functionality of dashboard prototypes. Healthcare professionals also discussed themes of human-technology interaction. This included mistrust of new digital tools and barriers to their use in residential aged care. The current study found that healthcare professionals want a dashboard that displays relevant resident data, such as medications, includes features for benchmarking, and provides detailed insights to support decision making. They expressed a need for evidence-based decision support but advocated for minimal alerts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Healthcare professionals were receptive to using a dashboard in residential aged care to minimise resident falls. They shared their design ideas in co-design interviews and workshops for a prospective dashboard. Findings informed the initial development and subsequent revisions of the dashboard to align with end-user preferences.",

The Miljacka river, flowing through Sarajevo, has been significantly impacted by industrial and urban wastewater discharges.ObjectiveThis study aims to develop a 3D digital model of the Miljacka river, built on topographic and satellite data, to support improved pollution assessment and inform water quality management strategies.MethodA 3D model of the river was created using integrated hydrological, topographic and satellite data. Initial 2D schematics were developed in AutoCAD and visualizations were produced in SketchUp, Revit and Twinmotion to simulate river flow dynamics and pollutant dispersion. Areas of interest were identified to assess the spatial distribution of contaminants.ResultsThe model enabled the visualization of pollutant movement and the identification of potentially high-risk zones along the river's course. Analysis of the available data suggests possible impacts of pollution on public health, particularly in relation to chemical contaminants and microbial loads, although further studies are needed for a more precise assessment of health risks.ConclusionThis research highlights the importance of integrating advanced digital technologies in environmental health assessment.",

Ultrasound-based technologies deliver energy to the dermis which causes neocollagenesis and neoelastogenesis to rejuvenate the skin.<h4>Objective</h4>This study evaluates and compares the efficacy of a high-intensity, parallel beam ultrasound-based skin tightening (HIUS) device with microfocused ultrasound with visualization (MFU-V) for improvement of upper arm skin laxity and crepiness.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A prospective, single-center, blinded, split-body, randomized clinical study investigated HIUS and MFU-V for improvement of upper arm skin laxity and crepiness. Subjects received a single treatment to the upper arms.<h4>Results</h4>Fourteen female subjects completed the study. Assessments compared Day 30 and Day 90 follow-up visits with baseline. HIUS was as effective as MFU-V in improving arm laxity and crepiness. Investigators and subjects rated improved arm laxity/crepiness at Day 90. Most subjects were satisfied with the improvement of arm laxity/crepiness. There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores observed between the HIUS and MFU-V. The MFU-V treatment took more time to perform than the HIUS treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>High-intensity, parallel beam ultrasound-based skin tightening was effective and delivered results with high patient satisfaction for improving upper arm skin laxity/crepiness.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Planning for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) necessitates advanced spatial visualization skills and consideration of multiple factors, including the depth of coronary arteries within the subepicardium, calcification levels, and pericardial adhesions.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to address these requirements by reconstructing a dynamic cardiovascular model, displaying it as a naked-eye hologram, and evaluating the clinical utility of this innovative visualization tool for preoperative CABG planning.<h4>Methods</h4>We used preoperative 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography (4D-CCTA) data from 14 patients scheduled for CABG to develop a semiautomated workflow. This workflow enabled time-resolved segmentation of the heart chambers, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and coronary arteries, complete with calcium scoring. Methods for segmenting cardiac structures, quantifying coronary calcification, visualizing coronary depth within EAT, and assessing pericardial adhesions via motion analysis were incorporated. These dynamic reconstructions captured spatial relationships, coronary stenosis, calcification, and depth in EAT, as well as pericardial adhesions. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were then generated and displayed using the Looking Glass platform (Looking Glass Factory Inc). Thirteen cardiac surgeons assessed the utility of the holographic visualization tool on a Likert scale. In addition, a surgeon visually scored pericardial adhesions using the holograms of all 21 patients (including 7 undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) and compared these scores with actual intraoperative findings.<h4>Results</h4>Cardiac surgeons highly rated the visualization tool for its utility in preoperative planning, with a mean Likert score of 4.57/5.0 (SD 0.5). The hologram-based scoring of pericardial adhesions showed a strong correlation with intraoperative findings (correlation coefficient r=0.786; P<.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study delineates the structural framework of a visualization tool specifically designed for preoperative CABG planning. It produces high-quality, clinically relevant, dynamic holograms from patient-specific volumetric data, with clinical feedback confirming its practicality and effectiveness for preoperative surgical planning.",

Here we present an approach to computing the anatomy of patients with congenital heart disease based on the whole of their diagnostic and surgical codes.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>All diagnostic and procedure codes for patients cared for between 1981 and 2020 at Boston Children's Hospital were extracted from a database containing diagnostic codes from echocardiograms, and procedural codes from surgical and catheterization procedures. The pipeline sequentially (1) mapped each of the 7500 native codes to algorithm codes; (2) computed the parent anatomy for each study using a pre-defined hierarchy; (3) computed the parent anatomy for the patient, based on highest ranking parent anatomy; and (4) computed the subcategories and mandatory co-variate findings for each patient. Thereafter, diagnostic accuracy of 500 unseen patients was adjudicated against clinical documentation by clinical experts.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 514\u00a0541 echocardiograms on 161\u00a0735 patients were available for this study. Phenotypes of congenital cardiac diseases were assigned in 84\u00a0285 patients (52%), and the remainder were computed to have normal anatomy. Clinicians agreed with algorithm assignments in 96.4% (482 of 500 patients), with disagreements most often representing definitional differences. An interactive dashboard enabled by the output of this algorithm is presented.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The computation of detailed congenital heart defect phenotypes from raw diagnostic and procedure codes is possible with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency. This framework may enable tools to support interactive outcomes reporting and clinical decision support.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Virtual dissection tables (VDTs) have emerged as innovative tools in anatomy education, offering interactive, three-dimensional visualization of anatomical structures. However, their performance in conjunction with traditional teaching methods needs to be further analyzed and synthesized. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, student satisfaction and perceived utility of VDTs compared to cadaveric dissection, lectures, and textbook-based learning.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search of literature identified 22 eligible studies involving students in medicine and related healthcare professions. Studies were analyzed in terms of design, cohort characteristics, educational outcomes, and anatomical content coverage. VDTs evaluated included commercial platforms such as Anatomage, Spectra, VH Dissector, and institutional in-house systems.<h4>Results</h4>VDT use was associated with improved academic performance in 86% of studies, with score increases ranging from 8 to 31% over traditional teaching methods. The greatest improvements were observed in musculoskeletal And neuroanatomy modules. Student satisfaction ranged from 64 to 95%, with the majority citing improved spatial understanding, engagement, And repeatability. However, preference for VDT-exclusive learning remained low, reported by only 2.4-30.2% of students. Most participants favored a hybrid approach combining VDTs with cadaver-based instruction. Despite these benefits, limitations included high implementation costs (up to $200,000 USD), limited access due to device scarcity, lack of tactile feedback, and significant variation in assessment methods and anatomical content. Additionally, no study conducted a direct comparison between various VDT platforms, nor between commercial and in-house systems.<h4>Conclusion</h4>VDTs represent a valuable complement to traditional anatomy education, enhancing learning outcomes and student engagement across a range of healthcare disciplines. However, their full potential is best realized when used as part of a multimodal curriculum that retains cadaveric dissection. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes, clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness, and to compare different VDT systems.",

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of an AR-HMD navigation system for facet joint injections in comparison with the conventional C-arm-guided approach.<h4>Methods</h4>In this prospective controlled study, 5 cadavers underwent computed tomography to generate 3D spine models. An AR application developed in Unity with Vuforia Engine was deployed on the HoloLens 2 headset for navigation. A neurosurgeon performed 216 facet joint needle placements (108 AR-assisted, 108 C-arm-guided). Postprocedural computed tomography validated placement accuracy. An independent blinded radiologist evaluated all placements.<h4>Results</h4>Of 216 total needle placements, 74 (34.3%) were rated excellent, 109 (50.5%) acceptable, and 33 (15.3%) failed. No significant difference in overall success rates was found between AR-guided and C-arm-guided approaches, \u03c72(2, 216) = 2.96, P = .23. However, lumbar region placements showed significantly higher success in the AR group compared with the control group, \u03c72(2, 120) = 7.09, P = .03.<h4>Conclusion</h4>AR-guided facet joint needle placement demonstrates accuracy and safety comparable to conventional C-arm-guided techniques. The AR-HMD system enhances 3D anatomic visualization and may reduce radiation exposure for healthcare personnel. These findings support further exploration of AR technology in spinal interventions.",

      "abstractText": "Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) has rapidly expanded into abdominal wall procedures, including inguinal and umbilical hernia repair. It offers improved ergonomics, three-dimensional visualization, and enhanced dexterity. However, its role in routine hernia surgery remains debatable, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness and patient outcomes. A narrative review of recently published systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized trials, and economic evaluations (2020-2025) was conducted. Evidence was synthesized to compare the clinical outcomes, perioperative metrics, and costs of the robotic, laparoscopic, and open techniques. RAS is associated with higher procedural costs, adding approximately USD 3000-5000 per inguinal hernia repair compared to laparoscopy, and total costs of USD 8000-12,000 for umbilical hernia repair. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios often exceed commonly accepted thresholds in current healthcare settings. Clinical outcomes reveal modest advantages, such as small reductions in early postoperative pain and a slightly earlier return to work, while complication and recurrence rates remain comparable to those of laparoscopy. Prolonged operative times, particularly during the learning curve, further increase the perioperative costs. Cost savings appear achievable only in high-volume centers with optimized team training. RAS represents a technological advance in hernia surgery, supported by structured educational programs and emerging innovations such as AI and augmented reality. In routine uncomplicated hernias, current evidence suggests only limited incremental benefits relative to the additional costs. Caution and selective adoption in anatomically complex or recurrent cases have been proposed, but require further validation through high-quality studies. Ongoing research, technological refinement, and reduction of system costs may progressively enhance the role of robotics in abdominal wall surgery.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The integration of digital tools into psychotherapy has gained increasing attention, particularly for practices such as routine outcome monitoring (ROM), which involves the regular collection of patient-reported data to inform treatment decisions. However, despite the potential benefits, the adoption of digital platforms remains limited, partly due to usability concerns and workflow misalignment.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to assess the usability of a digital platform, Mindy, designed to support psychotherapists in implementing ROM and to explore broader challenges associated with the integration of digital tools into psychotherapeutic practice.<h4>Methods</h4>This study adopted a qualitative, 2-stage approach. Sixteen psychotherapists participated in semistructured interviews, which included task-based usability testing and reflective discussions. Participants interacted with Mindy by performing typical clinical tasks, such as creating patient profiles, managing session data, and sending questionnaires. The first stage of analysis used a deductive thematic approach focused on predefined platform functionalities. The second stage followed an inductive methodology to identify broader themes related to the integration of digital tools in psychotherapy.<h4>Results</h4>The usability assessment identified strengths in the platform's appointment scheduling, questionnaire delivery, and dashboard functionalities, which were perceived as intuitive and supportive of ROM practices. However, limitations were reported in areas such as documentation flexibility, interoperability with other systems, and control over information sharing with patients. Broader thematic analysis revealed three main challenges: (1) the tension between standardized documentation and the need for narrative and implicit information; (2) difficulties in embedding digital platforms into existing therapeutic workflows, especially for clinicians less familiar with technology; and (3) concerns about confidentiality and the potential for misinterpretation when sharing therapeutic notes with patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings underscore the importance of considering both technical and contextual dimensions when developing and implementing digital platforms in mental health care. Tailoring digital tools to the needs and practices of psychotherapists may improve adoption and ultimately enhance the quality of care.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Research related to pediatric bone age has gained substantial scholarly attention over recent decades, given its critical importance in monitoring growth and guiding clinical decision-making in children. This study aims to identify research hotspots and forecast future trends in the field of bone age assessment through bibliometric and visualization analyses.<h4>Method</h4>A comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection to retrieve publications related to pediatric bone age from 1965 to 2024. Visualization analyses were performed utilizing VOSviewer (version 1.6.20), CiteSpace (version 6.3.R1), and the R package \"bibliometrix.\"<h4>Results</h4>A total of 4,652 publications on pediatric bone age were subjected for analysis, with an annual growth rate of 8.09%. The United States emerged as the leading contributor, accounting for 27.7% of the total publications, followed by China and Italy. Harvard University was identified as the most productive institution, with 328 publications, and the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism was the most influential journal in the field. The top three frequently occurring keywords included \"growth,\" \"age,\" and \"therapy.\" Keyword bursts revealed emerging keywords such as \"deep learning\" and \"artificial intelligence.\"<h4>Conclusion</h4>This bibliometric analysis identified that the future research within this area is expected to focus on integrating deep learning and artificial intelligence to improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical applications.<h4>Clinical trial number</h4>Not applicable.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the feasibility and safety of unilateral biportal endoscopic dorsal lumbosacral decompression in dogs.<h4>Methods</h4>13 canine cadavers were acquired. Three dogs were used in a pilot study to refine the technique. The remaining 10 were randomly assigned to left- or right-sided procedures. The main study was conducted from November 27 to November 30, 2024, following a pilot study performed 1 month earlier. Preoperative CT aided anatomical assessment and planning. Portal sites were based on the medial pedicle line, connecting the medial borders of the seventh lumbar vertebra and first sacral vertebra pedicles, as identified on dorsoventral radiographs. Unilateral biportal endoscopic dorsal lumbosacral decompression, including dorsal laminectomy, discectomy, and nerve root exploration, was performed. Portal sites, procedural times, and intraoperative complications were recorded. Postoperative CT assessed decompression and facet preservation. A 4-point scoring system (Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor) was used to evaluate visualization and facet joint preservation.<h4>Results</h4>All 10 cadavers were Beagles. All procedures were completed successfully through planned portals. Mean surgery time was 56.3 \u00b1 11.4 minutes. Visualization and facet joint preservation were all rated Excellent. Laminectomy and nerve root exploration times were longer ipsilaterally (17.4 \u00b1 7.2 minutes) than contralaterally (9.6 \u00b1 4.2 minutes), with a mean difference of 7.8 minutes. The mean laminectomy area was significantly larger ipsilaterally (17.6 \u00b1 6.7 mm2) versus contralaterally (10.5 \u00b1 7.3 mm2), with a mean difference of 7.1 mm2. No intraoperative complications occurred.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Unilateral biportal endoscopic dorsal lumbosacral decompression was feasible, safe, and provided excellent visualization in canine cadavers.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Unilateral biportal endoscopic dorsal lumbosacral decompression may represent a viable minimally invasive technique for degenerative lumbosacral stenosis in dogs and warrants further clinical investigation.",

      "abstractText": "Mass spectrometry-based lipidomics and metabolomics generate extensive data sets that, along with metadata such as clinical parameters, require specific data exploration skills to identify and visualize statistically significant trends and biologically relevant differences. Besides tailored methods developed by individual labs, a solid core of freely accessible tools exists for exploratory data analysis and visualization, which we have compiled here, including preparation of descriptive statistics, annotated box plots, hypothesis testing, volcano plots, lipid maps and fatty acyl chain plots, unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction, dendrograms, and heat maps. This review is intended for those who would like to develop their skills in data analysis and visualization using freely available R or Python solutions. Beginners are guided through a selection of R and Python libraries for producing publication-ready graphics without being overwhelmed by the code complexity. This manuscript, along with associated GitBook code repository containing step-by-step instructions, offers readers a comprehensive guide, encouraging the application of R and Python for robust and reproducible chemometric analysis of omics data.",

      "abstractText": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is affecting over 529 million adults and anticipated to impact 1.3 billion by 2050. This disease often coexists with multiple comorbidities, which can complicate its management. These comorbidities not only increase morbidity and mortality but also challenge the effectiveness of interventions designed to manage diabetes and improve patient outcomes. We analysed imbalanced data of 25.065 patients deriving from the Clinical Centre of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. The aim of the study was to explore the prevalence and temporal patterns of comorbidities before and after the diagnosis of T2DM using Association Rule Mining (ARM) and network visualization. The initial five years following T2DM diagnosis mark a spike in newly emerging health conditions. Hypertension frequently occurs at an earlier stage, while pneumonia, eye-related disorders, and ischemic heart disease consistently appear throughout the progression of the disease. The ARM analysis showed that both acute and chronic kidney diseases, as well as respiratory disorders are common after T2DM diagnosis. Certain gender-specific trends, such as higher instances of heart failure and acute kidney injury in males, are also notable. The study highlights how ARM techniques reveal complex patterns in chronic disease management, suggesting potential pathways for targeted treatments.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Antimicrobial resistance caused by inappropriate antibiotic use has become a global public health crisis. The majority of antibiotics are prescribed at primary care settings which often lack sufficient capacity and surveillance. This study aimed at identifying and testing pragmatic measures and models derived from routinely collected electronic records of primary care encounters to inform continuous antibiotics stewardship.<h4>Methods</h4>We first extracted a total of 7.097\u00a0million records of primary care visits over 25 months from Anhui, China, through stratified random cluster sampling and a minimum set of data about related communities. We then identified pragmatic measures and models for examining antibiotic prescribing at primary care settings through repeated cycles of measure/model identification and relevance analysis. The 'identification' used multidisciplinary group meetings while the analysis adopted hybrid methodologies, including descriptive analysis, random forest classification modeling, and data visualization.<h4>Results</h4>The study revealed that: (a) antibiotic prescribing rates ranged from 36.82 to 86.25% for the 7 categories of diagnoses studied, including respiratory diseases (RD), digestive diseases (DD), urogenital diseases (UD), skin infections (SI), injuries (IJ), eye infections (EI), and oral and dental diseases (OD); (b) although overall antibiotic prescribing decreased from 67.80 to 47.11% over the study period, the proportion of broad-spectrum added up to 78.96%; (c) the top 10% and 20% clinicians prescribed 59.9% and 80.0% of all the antibiotic prescriptions; (d) 50.8% of the antibiotic recipients received 2 or more antibiotic prescriptions within the 25-months; (e) the AUC of models of antibiotic prescribing ranged from 0.92 to 0.97 for the 7-category- diagnoses, in which the patient, clinician and spatiotemporal variables contributed 0.08\u2009~\u20090.27, 0.30\u2009~\u20090.70 and 0.16\u2009~\u20090.62 respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The measures and models derived out of routinely collected electronic records of primary healthcare encounters in this study are both feasible and useful.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Analyses in oncology frequently include Cox proportional hazards models for survival outcomes, but reported results typically only include hazard ratios and respective inference. Cox model predictions of survival functions may help to provide a greater clinical meaning from fitted Cox models for precision oncology research.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We created a publicly available software library, shinyCox, that can generate user-friendly interactive applications to visualize survival outcome predictions of fitted Cox models. To illustrate the benefits of this software, we analyzed data from AML02 and AML08, randomized clinical trials for pediatric patients with AML. Building on a recent article, we assessed how baseline factors and a pharmacogenomics score (ACS10) can affect the predicted overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) between patients assigned to induction regimens of clofarabine plus cytarabine or daunorubicin and etoposide combined with low-dose cytarabine or high-dose cytarabine.<h4>Results</h4>Our model outcome prediction visualization application highlights previously reported associations of ACS10 with EFS and OS, while also providing a better understanding of how other prognostic factors amplify or mitigate prognostic implications of ACS10. It is informative to better understand the practical clinical outcomes in terms of predicted survival probabilities to complement the insights gained from hazard ratio tables.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using shinyCox, we generated visualization applications that let us identify complex relationships between the ACS10 score, age, and the predicted OS and EFS probabilities after AML therapy. This article shows how shinyCox will facilitate model interpretation and accelerate the development of personalized therapies in oncology.",

      "abstractText": "<i>Spirulina</i> (<i>Arthrospira platensis</i>) is a valuable cyanobacterium used for various applications, including health supplements, cosmetics, biofertilizers, carbon capture, and biofuels. Efficient monitoring of microalgae growth in photobioreactors is crucial for optimizing yields in large-scale culturing. Existing monitoring systems take samples from the bioreactor at different intervals and perform the visualization and quantification of algae growth parameters. In this work, a microfluidic platform is mounted on a tubular photobioreactor, and the system continuously monitors the growth behavior of <i>Spirulina</i> over several days, with algal development captured on demand. Furthermore, the microfluidic sensor is fabricated using a novel xurography-based approach on photopolymer sheets. It captures real-time micrographs of algae continuously for 5 days (over 120 hours) under two different conditions: open-loop and closed-loop. In the open-loop configuration, the sensor hydrostatically taps the algal medium from the bioreactor at regular intervals. In contrast, the closed-loop sensor continuously (24/7) circulates the culture medium through the microchip for visualization without the use of any driving mechanism. From the micrographs, algal cell density, cell count, and trichome length are estimated continuously, and all parameters exhibited an increasing trend over time. Importantly, the cell density obtained from the microfluidic sensor closely matches with the conventional benchmark glass slide method, with an error of less than 3.3%. The microfluidic monitoring platform is found to be low-cost, accurate, fast, and efficient compared to existing systems, and moreover, it is easily amenable to automation.",

      "abstractText": "Recently, technology has evolved significantly in the rehabilitation process for neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, as a fundamental base of brain rehabilitation, is the change in the output of neural circuits in response to the stimulus of the input activity. The physiological and anatomical changes that occur following a brain insult compel the brain to rewire for the sake of reacquiring lost functions or behaviors in a driven form of neural plasticity called neurorehabilitation. One of the main challenges in neuroscience research is the accurate visualization of the brain structure and brain connectivity related to behaviors and memory. Building machine learning predictive models for brain disorders associated with neural circuits and brain plasticity defects is a promising early detection tool for some mental health disorders. Machine learning is becoming more impactful in neuroimaging because it can discern intricate patterns in multidimensional and multimodal data. This technology may then be utilized to generate data-driven classifications and predictions for specific patients. In this review, we discuss main ideologies of neuroplasticity concepts as well as the concept of neuroplasticity induction and neural circuit defects associated with neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to discussing some applications of artificial intelligence of machine learning (ML) models for the future vision of early mental health detection in low- and middle-income countries. This review considers how the health system stratifies rehabilitation and utilizes large data sets for strengthening health systems.",

The optimized parameters were implemented on a clinical 3\u202fT scanner and tested in four subjects. Quantitative measures included blood-muscle contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) for lumen-wall and lumen-IPH. Imaging was performed in 21 patients with carotid artery disease, two MPRAGE acquisitions were performed per patient: (1) at the magnet isocenter with the standard IR pulse, and (2) at a 50-mm shifted position toward the heart with the wideband IR pulse. Qualitative image quality was evaluated independently by two neuroradiologists using a predefined 4-point scale (1\u202f=\u202fpoor, 4\u202f=\u202fexcellent) for blood suppression, vessel wall clarity, motion artifacts, and IPH visualization, in addition to quantitative SNR and CNR measurements.<h4>Results</h4>The optimized MPRAGE sequence demonstrated significantly improved blood suppression, with blood-muscle contrast increasing from 0.42\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08 to 0.61\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.07 (p\u202f=\u202f0.002). Lumen-wall CNR increased from 15.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.4 to 22.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.1 (p\u202f=\u202f0.01), and lumen-IPH CNR increased from 18.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.2 to 26.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.0 (p\u202f=\u202f0.004). These improvements enhanced vessel wall delineation and IPH conspicuity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Optimization of MPRAGE parameters enhances blood suppression and contrast, providing improved visualization of the carotid vessel wall and more reliable detection of IPH. This approach may increase the diagnostic accuracy of carotid plaque imaging.",

      "abstractText": "Robotic surgery has now been widely applied in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), driving significant growth in related research activities. This study aims to reveal the research hotspots, emerging frontiers, and future research trends in the field of robotic CRC surgery through bibliometrics and visualization methods. Literature related to robotic CRC surgery from 2001 to 2024 was systematically retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The Citespace software was used to perform bibliometric and visualization analysis. A total of 2086 publications were finally included in this study. The USA and China ranked the top two in terms of publication output. Yonsei University and its affiliated health system took the leading position in both paper output and citation count. The early- and mid-term research primarily focused on \"learning curve\", \"initial experience\", \"short-term outcome\", \"pathological outcome\", \"quality of life\", and \"anastomotic leakage\". In recent years, research directions, such as \"deep learning\", \"artificial intelligence (AI)\", and \"functional outcomes\", have gained prominence. This study identifies that research hotspots in robotic CRC surgery include comparative investigations of robotic versus laparoscopic approaches, functional preservation, complication management, and multimodal therapy integration for liver metastases. Emerging trends highlight the integration of AI and deep learning, alongside a shift toward prioritizing functional protection and quality of life. Future efforts should focus on long-term outcome data in complex cases, advancing AI-driven personalized strategies, standardizing training protocols, and conducting cost-effectiveness analysis. These efforts will enhance the safety, efficacy, and global accessibility of robotic techniques.",

      "abstractText": "Systematic Evidence Maps (SEMs) are a form of evidence synthesis offering structured approaches to categorizing and organizing scientific evidence by identifying trends and gaps. SEMs support researchers and policymakers in navigating complex evidence landscapes. By synthesizing evidence, they lay the foundation for targeted systematic reviews and primary research, supporting evidence-informed decision-making. These outputs can be hosted on websites, providing an interactive tool. In environmental health, SEMs are systematically used to categorize evidence on topics such as pollution control measures, climate change impacts, and health disparities. The methodological framework for conducting SEMs involves defining the research scope, employing a systematic search strategy, screening studies systematically, optionally conducting critical appraisal (risk of bias assessment) when studies are categorized by effect direction or intended to inform subsequent syntheses, and coding data for synthesis and visualization. Narrative synthesis, heatmaps and network diagrams enhance SEMs usability. However, challenges remain, including methodological inconsistencies and the need for standardization. Advances in automation, machine learning, and stakeholder engagement can further refine SEMs methodologies. This commentary situates SEMs within the broader family of evidence synthesis, emphasizing their role in environmental health science. By enhancing methodological clarity and leveraging innovative tools, SEMs can support researchers and decision-makers in navigating complex evidence ecosystems and implementing evidence-based solutions for environmental scientists.",

The consequences of crowding are well documented with negative impacts on patient outcomes, patient/family satisfaction, staff stress, and medical errors. This study describes the implementation of the Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale in 2 emergency departments, a 45-bed and a 22-bed, within a large pediatric academic medical center. Initial work revealed the scale worked well at a 45-bed emergency department but significantly underreported crowding at the 22-bed emergency department. A bed capacity correction factor was developed and incorporated in the Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale formula, thus standardizing the view of crowding in each emergency department. The modified Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale provided real-time visualization of crowding in both emergency departments and health care system capacity management systems. The modified Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale was shared with a pediatric emergency department within another large academic pediatric medical center. Implementation of the bed capacity correction factor into their system resulted in a similarly improved demonstration of emergency department crowding through the Pediatric Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Aim</h4>The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the extent of tooth structure preservation, efficacy of canal orifice identification, and procedural time during access cavity preparation in primary molars indicated for pulpectomy using three different visualization techniques: the naked eye, surgical loupes, and the dental operating microscope (DOM).<h4>Methods</h4>Forty-five children aged 5-8 years who required pulpectomy and met the inclusion criteria (CTRI/2023/05/067642) were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 15 each) based on the visualization modality employed. Standardized access cavity preparations were performed under different magnifications. Postoperative images of the access cavities were obtained using a DOM and analyzed using ImageJ\u00ae software to quantify the conservation of the tooth structure. The number of canal orifices identified and the total treatment time were documented for each case. Statistical analyses were conducted using one way analysis of variance, Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference, and Chi square tests.<h4>Results</h4>Access cavity preparations performed under DOM demonstrated significantly greater conservation of tooth structure (P = 0.002) and the highest canal orifice detection rate. However, procedures performed under surgical loupes required the least amount of time (mean: 352.7 seconds). Conventional visualization is associated with more substantial structural loss and lower diagnostic precision.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Magnification-assisted endodontics significantly improves the precision of access cavity preparation. While the DOM offers optimal dentin conservation and enhanced canal orifice detection, surgical loupes strike a balance between improved visualization and procedural efficiency. The integration of magnification tools in pediatric endodontics will surely enhance clinical outcomes, although practical considerations such as cost, training, and operator adaptability must be acknowledged.",

This study systematically reviews the research progress in the field of EMR-neurological interactions during 2013-2024, revealing its research hotspots and future trends. Based on WOS database, this study adopts bibliometric method combined with visualization technology for multidimensional analysis. The construction of visual maps of countries, institutions, authors, keywords and other elements is realized through CiteSpace and VOSviewer software, which systematically reveals the developmental lineage and knowledge structure of the research field. The study reveals that the field has been growing continuously, with China, Iran and the United States as the core research countries, the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences and other organizations contributing prominently, and Environment International leading the list with an impact factor of 21.90. High-frequency keywords include \"adolescents,\"hippocampus\" and \"synaptic plasticity\", reflecting the focus of research on neurodevelopmental and functional impairments. The study points out that although the mechanism of the neurological effects of electromagnetic radiation has been achieved, its molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions still need to be further explored. This study provides a systematic reference for scholars around the world, helps to promote the development of the field of neural effects of electromagnetic radiation, and provides a scientific basis for public health protection.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Health disparities, particularly among racial and ethnic minority populations, were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factors like social determinants of health, vaccine hesitancy, and pre-existing health conditions. Local government leaders within an urban city received federal funds to address these disparities by improving health literacy and engaging in culturally responsive outreach and education among Black and Latinx communities within a mid-sized city in the southeastern United States.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify facilitators and barriers to implementing public health strategies aimed at addressing COVID-19 health disparities in a community guided by the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework.<h4>Design</h4>The research team conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews via telephone, Zoom, or in person between March 20th and April 12th, 2024.<h4>Participants/setting</h4>Fifteen participants, including local governmental health office staff (e.g., nurse navigators, administrative staff) and employees from community center partner sites, were included in the study.<h4>Analysis</h4>Two coders applied both a priori codes guided by the RE-AIM framework and data-driven inductive codes to transcripts in NVivo 14. A final interrater reliability measurement, Cohen's kappa coefficient (k\u00a0=\u00a00.74), was calculated, indicating a moderate level of agreement between coders. NVivo 14 data visualization tools (e.g., coding matrices) were used to inform thematic content analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Themes were identified within each RE-AIM dimension, highlighting various facilitators and barriers to implementing the selected public health strategies. Working in synergy with community center staff and other community partners to create tailored services and resources was vital for successful implementation. Transparency and timely communication, additional full-time program implementers (i.e., nurse navigators), and sustainable funding sources were identified as key elements to enhance effective implementation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Insights from the local governmental health office and community center staff's experiences in this study highlight recommendations for effective implementation of locally tailored public health strategies to address COVID-19 health disparities in similar community-based settings. Future research should capture the perceptions and experiences of community members to better understand acceptability, accessibility, and utilization in similar initiatives.",

To develop a diagnostic radiotracer for nectin4, a nanobody-based PET tracer was selected from several candidate sequences and prepared via [<sup>18</sup>F]AlF radiolabeling. The radiochemical quality was assessed, and tracer uptake was evaluated in cell lines and tumor models with varying nectin4 expression levels. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies showed that the tracer exhibited a specific affinity for nectin4, with a binding affinity (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>) of 6.77 nM in cell lines. The tracer enabled clear visualization of nectin4-expressing lesions, and its uptake profile and pharmacokinetic behavior were characterized using dynamic PET imaging and kinetic analysis. A correlation between PET signal intensity and histological nectin4 expression was also observed in tumor models. Thus, it may have the potential to become a nectin4 tracer for clinical applications.",

Although odontomas have been referenced as occurring in dogs and cats, there are no publications pertaining to odontomas in cats. This case series of nine odontomas in eight cats includes description of clinical presentations, diagnostic imaging findings, histopathologic characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Common clinical presentations in this study include missing teeth, tooth displacement, presence of a fluctuant mass, and alveolar bone expansion. Diagnostic imaging reveals a mixed radiodense central opacity containing radiopaque tooth-like structures and a variably thick radiolucent rim, consistent with compound odontomas. However, one mature odontoma in an older patient had fusion of the denticles that complicated visualization of discrete denticles radiographically. Three lesions contained unerupted teeth and two had unilocular radiolucencies consistent with cyst formation. Although radiographic findings are often highly diagnostic for odontomas, it is recommended to send an oral biopsy of the lesion to a histopathologist who has a focus on oral and maxillofacial pathology for confirmation of the diagnosis. Common treatments include either surgical en bloc resection or enucleation and curettage. In this study, both treatment types were curative and there was no documented recurrence in the cats for whom follow-up was available.",

      "abstractText": "The rectus abdominis (RA) muscle is a key muscle in the anterior abdominal wall, contributing to motion of trunk flexion, assisting with stabilization of the pelvis, and maintaining intra-abdominal pressure. Its integrity is essential for posture, respiration, and functional movement, and it is frequently implicated in clinical conditions such as abdominal wall hernias, rectus diastasis, muscle strains, and postoperative complications. Accurate evaluation of the RA is therefore critical for both diagnostic and rehabilitative purposes. Musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSKUS) has emerged as a valuable imaging modality for assessing the structure and function of the RA muscle. Offering real-time, dynamic visualization without ionizing radiation, MSKUS enables clinicians and researchers to examine muscle morphology, thickness, echogenicity, and contractile behavior with high precision. Compared with other imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, MSKUS is more accessible, cost-effective, and well-suited for repeated assessments in both clinical and research settings. Recent advances in MSKUS have expanded its role in evaluating abdominal wall musculature, particularly in populations ranging from athletes and postoperative patients to postpartum women. By providing detailed, noninvasive insights into the RA muscle, MSKUS contributes to improved diagnosis, monitoring of rehabilitation progress, and the development of targeted interventions.",

In April 2023, Japan approved this system, and as the world's first clinical institution to implement OQrimo<sup>\u00ae</sup>, we aimed to evaluate its safety and clinical utility.<h4>Research design</h4>Retrospective case series METHODS: The study analyzed all vitreoretinal surgery utilizing OQrimo<sup>\u00ae</sup> at Kyushu University Hospital between December 1, 2023 and November 31, 2024. Data collection included patient demographics, preoperative diagnoses, surgical procedures, equipment used, surgical records, and perioperative complications. We analyzed OQrimo's safety profile and patterns of clinical use based on these data.<h4>Results</h4>Eight eyes from eight patients were included. Preoperative diagnoses included proliferative vitreoretinopathy, panuveitis, acute retinal necrosis, macular hole, and secondary glaucoma due to uveitis. The purpose of pars plana vitrectomy included silicone oil removal, vitreous biopsy, internal limiting membrane peeling, and Ahmed valve implantation via pars plana. OQrimo<sup>\u00ae</sup> maintained stable endoscope positioning in all cases, enabling observation of the peripheral retina without scleral indentation. In seven cases, OQrimo's endoscopic visualization and a wide-viewing system were used simultaneously. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed in any case.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We confirmed the safety of OQrimo<sup>\u00ae</sup> during its initial clinical application. The system facilitated the observation of the peripheral retina using an intraocular endoscope without scleral indentation.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific syndrome that poses serious risks to both maternal and fetal health globally. Despite the accumulation of multi-omics datasets from various studies, a unified platform that integrates these resources for comprehensive analysis remains unavailable.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed CPMOAD (Comprehensive Preeclampsia Multi-Omics Analysis Database), an online platform designed to integrate RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and literature-curated data related to PE. All datasets were uniformly processed to generate differential expression profiles, methylation data, and curated molecular interaction records. The database is equipped with interactive visualization tools and customizable analysis modules.<h4>Results</h4>CPMOAD offers access to a broad spectrum of PE-relevant data, including gene expression and methylation profiles. Users can perform differential expression analysis, methylation analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis directly through the web interface. The platform also enables the exploration of validated molecular signatures associated with PE.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CPMOAD serves as a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for integrated multi-omics analysis in preeclampsia research. By consolidating diverse datasets and providing powerful analytical tools, CPMOAD aims to accelerate the discovery of molecular mechanisms and potential biomarkers for PE. The database is freely accessible at http://nscc.zzu.edu.cn/CPMOAD/ .",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Cancer remains a leading global cause of mortality, demanding robust surveillance systems to inform public health strategies. Current cancer surveillance systems, particularly in low-resource settings, often lack on-demand analytics, spatial visualization, and predictive modeling, limiting their utility in addressing disparities and guiding targeted interventions. This study aimed to design, develop, and evaluate a GIS-integrated cancer surveillance systems tailored to the epidemiological and geographical context of Iran.<h4>Methods</h4>Employing a three-phase approach, the study began with a systematic review of cancer surveillance indicators, followed by the design and development of the system using a modular architecture supported by Django and Vue.js frameworks. The system integrates multi-level data standardization, GIS-based spatial analysis, and predictive analytics for on-demand insights. Usability evaluation was conducted using Nielsen's Heuristic Assessment, incorporating feedback from medical informatics specialists, pathologists, and health managers.<h4>Results</h4>The Cancer Surveillance System incorporated critical data elements validated with CVR (>\u20090.51) and Cronbach's alpha (0.849). Phase two developed a GIS-integrated, scalable system handling 20\u00a0million records, enabling on-demand monitoring, spatial analysis, and risk factor evaluation. Predictive modeling tools forecast cancer trends over 5-, 10-, and 20-year horizons, adhering to WHO standards. Usability evaluation resolved 85% of identified issues, enhancing functionality, user satisfaction, and scalability for precision cancer surveillance.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study presents a scalable and adaptable CSS framework that bridges traditional surveillance limitations and modern analytical demands. Its integration of advanced technologies provides a model for global adaptation, supporting equitable resource distribution and evidence-based cancer control strategies.",

      "abstractText": "Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD), also known as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), is a prevalent hormonal and metabolic condition primarily affecting women of reproductive age worldwide. It is typically marked by disrupted ovulation, an increase in circulating androgen hormones, and the presence of multiple small ovarian follicles, which collectively result in menstrual irregularities, infertility challenges, and associated metabolic disturbances. This study presents an automated diagnostic framework for PCOD detection from transvaginal ultrasound images, leveraging an Enhanced [Formula: see text] convolutional neural network architecture. The model incorporates attention mechanisms, batch normalization, and dropout regularization to improve feature learning and generalization. Bayesian Optimization was employed to fine-tune critical hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate, ensuring optimal model performance. The proposed system was trained and validated on a curated ovarian ultrasound image dataset, applying data augmentation and SMOTE techniques to address class imbalance. Experimental evaluation demonstrated that the Enhanced [Formula: see text] model achieved a classification accuracy of 94.8%, sensitivity of 93.2%, specificity of 95.5%, precision of 94.0%, and an F1-score of 93.6% on the independent test set. Interpretability was enhanced through Grad-CAM visualization, which effectively localized diagnostically significant regions within the ultrasound images, corroborating clinical findings. These results highlight the potential of the proposed deep learning-based framework to serve as a reliable, scalable, and interpretable decision-support tool for PCOD diagnosis, offering improved diagnostic consistency and reducing operator dependency in clinical workflows.",

      "abstractText": "Inflammatory bowel disease is classified into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis involves only the colon, whereas CD is characterized by small bowel involvement, which is a hallmark feature. However, the small bowel is the final frontier of endoscopic evaluation; therefore, small bowel involvement is considered a significant medical challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CD. Endoscopic visualization and biopsy sampling of the small bowel are crucial for accurate diagnosis, effective monitoring, and management of complications of CD. Small bowel endoscopy enables the early detection of mucosal lesions, facilitates timely intervention for complications such as strictures or bleeding, and plays a critical role in reducing the need for surgical resection. Moreover, it enables targeted tissue acquisition and objective assessment of disease activity, both of which are crucial for optimal treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic responses. Given these clinical advantages, small bowel endoscopy has become an indispensable tool in the comprehensive management of CD. This review summarizes the current role and evolving advances in small bowel endoscopy, with particular emphasis on its therapeutic applications-including enteroscopic balloon dilation, endoscopic hemostasis, and foreign body retrieval-and discusses future directions based on recent evidence and expert guidelines.",

      "abstractText": "The integrity of herbal products is frequently undermined by both intentional and unintentional adulteration, leading to substantial health risks and economic losses. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a DNA-based molecular technique, has emerged as a formidable solution due to its simplicity, specificity, sensitivity, and ability to operate under isothermal conditions. The review critically evaluates the application of LAMP in authenticating herbal materials, showcasing its enhanced efficiency and user-friendliness compared to conventional techniques. The LAMP technique employs four to six primers that target six to eight distinct regions of the target DNA, ensuring unparalleled specificity. The amplification at a constant temperature negates the need for thermal cyclers, thus rendering it highly suitable for point-of-care applications and field-based authentication. The article presents case studies that illustrate LAMP's efficacy in detecting adulteration across traditional medicines, dietary supplements, and crude drug materials. Visualization methods in LAMP, such as turbidity, colorimetry, and fluorescence, greatly enhance its accessibility and ease of use, making it well-suited for both laboratory and field applications. Although there are limitations, such as primer design complexity and contamination risks, recent innovations, including the use of lyophilized reagents, multiplexing capabilities, and integration with mobile detection platforms, are significantly advancing the practicality of LAMP assays. This review underscores the potential of LAMP in both regulatory and commercial contexts, promoting the authenticity, safety, and quality of herbal products, thereby making a vital contribution to consumer protection and the sustainability of the herbal medicine trade.",

      "abstractText": "A three-dimensional retinal shape was reconstructed by refractive topography (RT).<h4>Methods</h4>The personalized optical models of the human eye were reconstructed based on geometric parameters from clinical measurements. The expected refraction distribution on the fundus was calculated for each model. Subsequently, the refraction-position conversion function (RPF) was derived by fitting the data sets, which included the field of view (FOV), vitreous thickness (VT), and refraction. Additionally, the coordinates on the fundus of the human eye were calculated from RT data through the RPF. Ultimately, a three-dimensional retinal shape was reconstructed.<h4>Results</h4>The expected refraction was calculated on 6 subjects. The results demonstrate that the expected refraction decreased as the VT increased. However, when the FOV was greater than 8\u00b0, the expected refraction increased with increasing FOV. A polynomial was applied to fit the 656 data points, resulting in the formation of the RPF. The fitting results demonstrated that the relationship tended to be similar in general for different human eyes, but there were individual differences. This reconstructed method provided good agreement between the reconstructed three-dimensional retina shape and the OCT measurements.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The reconstructed three-dimensional retinal shape from RT data enables new imaging protocols that improve visualization of retinal shape.",

      "abstractText": "Accurate characterization of brain tumor heterogeneities and microvascular dynamics remains an unmet need in cancer research driving the development of innovative imaging methods. Here, laser ultrasound super-resolution imaging (LUSSI) is introduced, a hybrid modality combining laser-generated ultrasound with optoacoustic (OA) contrast to enable functional volumetric (3D) super-resolution imaging of vascular structures in vivo. The system integrates a laser ultrasound (LUS) emitter and a spherical array transducer to localize microbubble responses in 3D, further enabling concurrent acquisition of multi-spectral (multi-wavelength) OA data. The capabilities of LUSSI to assess tumor heterogeneities are demonstrated in a murine glioblastoma model, including visualization of intra-tumoral vasculature, identification of compressed vessels, and detection of functional abnormalities such as hemorrhages and hypoxic regions. OA imaging further enables resolving oxygenated and deoxygenated forms of hemoglobin, revealing heterogeneous perfusion within the tumor core. LUSSI is further shown to resolve whole-brain vascular networks with \u224835\u00a0\u00b5m resolution and quantify microvascular blood flow and oxygenation, supporting applications in neuroscience. With its non-invasive, multi-parametric capabilities and proven compatibility with clinical imaging components, LUSSI offers a promising platform for studying vascular pathology, monitoring therapy, and advancing translational imaging strategies.",

      "abstractText": "To assess the value of contrast-enhanced lumbar MRI in guiding the selection of surgical approaches for recurrent lumbar disc herniation (RLDH) treated with full-endoscopic surgery. Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed from 237 patients with RLDH who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced lumbar MRI. Surgical approaches were selected based on the location and degree of nucleus pulposus extrusion observed on MRI. The disc levels involved were as follows: L2/3 (1 case), L3/4 (11 cases), L4/5 (111 cases), and L5/S1 (114 cases). Surgical duration, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stays, and surgical complications were recorded. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for low back and leg pain. All patients successfully underwent full-endoscopic discectomy. At one month postoperatively and at the final follow-up, VAS and ODI scores showed significant improvement compared to preoperative values (final follow-up vs. preoperative: lower back pain VAS [0.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50 vs. 2.54\u2009\u00b1\u20091.82], leg pain VAS [0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29 vs. 5.53\u2009\u00b1\u20091.65], and ODI [0.51\u2009\u00b1\u20090.98 vs. 66.08\u2009\u00b1\u200947.14]). According to the modified MacNab criteria, outcomes were rated as excellent in 195 cases, good in 35, fair in 5, and poor in 2, yielding an excellent-to-good rate of 97.0%. No serious intraoperative, postoperative, or follow-up complications were observed. Contrast-enhanced lumbar MRI provides clear visualization of intraspinal anatomical structures in patients with RLDH, facilitating accurate preoperative determination of decompression boundaries. By assessing the spatial relationship between the reherniated nucleus pulposus and the pedicle, and incorporating iliac crest height and surgical history, the optimal surgical approach can be selected. This enables safe and effective removal of herniated disc material, adequate nerve root decompression, and favorable clinical outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies of the digestive system and is characterized by an extremely low five-year survival rate. The perineural invasion (PNI) status in patients with pancreatic cancer is positively correlated with adverse prognoses, including overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Emerging radiomic methods can reveal subtle variations in tumor structure by analyzing preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) imaging data. Therefore, we propose the development of a preoperative CECT-based radiomic model to predict the risk of PNI in patients with pancreatic cancer.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This study enrolled patients with pancreatic malignancies who underwent radical resection. Computerized tools were employed to extract radiomic features from tumor regions of interest (ROIs). The optimal radiomic features associated with PNI were selected to construct a radiomic score (RadScore). The model's reliability was comprehensively evaluated by integrating clinical and follow-up information, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based visualization to interpret the decision-making processes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 167 patients with pancreatic malignancies were included. From the CECT images, 851 radiomic features were extracted, 22 of which were identified as most strongly correlated with PNI. These 22 features were evaluated using seven machine learning methods. We ultimately selected the Gaussian naive Bayes model, which demonstrated robust predictive performance in both the training and validation cohorts, and achieved area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.899 and 0.813, respectively. Among the clinical features, maximum tumor diameter, CA-199 level, blood glucose concentration, and lymph node metastasis were found to be independent risk factors for PNI. The integrated model yielded AUCs of 0.945 (training cohort) and 0.881 (validation cohort). Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the ensemble model to predict perineural invasion.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The combined model integrating clinical and radiomic features exhibited excellent performance in predicting the probability of perineural invasion in patients with pancreatic cancer. This approach has significant potential to optimize therapeutic decision-making and prognostic evaluation in patients with PNI.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>Due to limitations in current imaging technologies detecting subtle cardiac microstructural changes that can lead to sudden cardiac death is a significant clinical challenge. To address this problem, we developed a forward-viewing optical coherence tomography (OCT) endoscope for the detection of relevant cardiac microstructures in the subendocardium, including Purkinje fibers, scar tissue, surviving myocytes, and adipose tissue.<h4>Methods</h4>An endoscopic probe based on the scanning fiber principle was developed for OCT measurements in contact. The probe was evaluated in freshly excised ovine hearts exhibiting chronic myocardial infarction. Relevant regions within the cardiac chamber were measured, and distinctive microstructures were identified, characterized, and subsequently corroborated using Masson's trichrome staining. The volumetric imaging data were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect Purkinje fibers, enabling the reconstruction of their 3D morphology.<h4>Results</h4>We were able to distinguish between healthy myocardium, fibrotic remodeling, and critical elements of the cardiac conduction system. Our findings demonstrate the capability of this technology to provide detailed images of cardiac microstructures in large mammal hearts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A novel application of forward-viewing endoscopic OCT in cardiology is demonstrated by visualizing cardiac microstructures within the subendocardium at depths accessible by optical imaging modalities.<h4>Significance</h4>By enhancing visualization at the cellular level, this method may contribute to a better understanding of cardiac physiology and pathology, potentially extending future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstractText": "The development of fluorescent probes that target the tumor stroma to help surgeons detect and remove malignant lesions using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)-guided surgery is advancing rapidly. Such advancements show promise for a range of malignancies, expanding the eligibility of patients for surgical intervention and offering improved surgical outcomes. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), is highly upregulated within the tumor stroma of nearly all solid tumors. It is a promising tumor target for NIRF-guided surgery, especially in solid tumors with dense tumor stroma, such as pancreatic cancer. In this study, we aimed to develop FAP-targeting fluorescent probes with enhanced pharmacokinetics for the NIRF-guided surgery of pancreatic cancer. Three novel FAP-targeted probes (eFAPs) based on a (4-quinolinoyl)-glycyl-2-cyanopyrrolidine (QCP) structure equipped with the NIRF dye IRDye800CW were designed and synthesized. All of the probes displayed excellent inhibition potency and selectivity to FAP. The probes consistently exhibited strong inhibition and specific uptake in FAP-expressing U87 glioblastoma cells. In in vivo optical imaging studies, eFAP-24 showed a tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) of 3.1 \u00b1 0.6 at 24 h postinjection, enabling the clear delineation of tumors using the clinical Quest Spectrum NIRF imaging system. A strong fluorescence signal in the tumor and a negligible uptake in nontarget tissues were confirmed by biodistribution analyses. The successful development and validation of FAP-targeting fluorescent probes, especially eFAP-24, offers promising prospects for enhancing the visualization of FAP-rich stromal compartments improving surgical outcomes through NIRF-guided surgery, particularly in solid tumors with dense stroma such as pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Amputation level in diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is most determined based on surgeon visualization of macroscopic criteria, leading to subjective variability. Wide variance in methods of bone histological analysis and culture are utilized to determine the presence of residual infection. We therefore conducted a systematic, qualitative review to evaluate the current available data on objective measures to delineate the appropriate level of resection in diabetic toe and forefoot amputations, as well as the accuracy of different methods to assess for persistent infection.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a systematic review of studies from 1990 to 2023 performed on methods to determine margins in toe and forefoot amputations for DFO following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Data were summarized to discuss the study main objectives, methods utilized to determine amputation level, and techniques used to assess margins for persistent deep infection.<h4>Results</h4>568 articles were identified, and 18 articles met the final inclusion criteria after review. All studies used plain radiographs for preoperative assessment. 13 used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of their algorithm to determine general amputation level and 3 used MRI to determine exact depth of resection. 15 studies used microbiological cultures and 13 used histopathological margins intraoperatively to assess margins for deep infection. Of those, 7 studies found that those with positive margins had higher rates of treatment failure.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Overall, majority of studies used combination of plain radiographs of MRI to determine amputation level. Patients who ultimately had positive margins correlated with longer antibiotic duration and higher rates of continued infection, impaired wound healing, reoperation, or readmission. Elucidating the optimal method of evaluating clean surgical margins is critical to lessen the burden on health care systems and improve patient care.<b>Level of Evidence:</b> Level III: Qualitative Review.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The introduction of BPaL and BPaLM regimens has revolutionized drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, offering superior efficacy, shorter duration, and better tolerability than conventional therapies. Despite their rapid WHO guideline incorporation, no prior bibliometric analysis has been conducted on this topic. This study addresses this gap by mapping global knowledge production, collaborations, and thematic trends to inform future research and implementation strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed Scopus-indexed publications using controlled vocabulary for BPaL/BPaLM regimens. From 551 initial records, 120 met inclusion criteria after screening. Bibliometrix and VOS Viewer software evaluated publication trends, authorship, institutional/geographical contributions, citations, and keyword networks. Visualization tools mapped collaborations and thematic clusters, while statistical methods assessed growth rates and citation impacts.<h4>Results</h4>The study identified 1,081 authors, with publications growing at 11.61% annually and peaking in 2024 (n\u2009=\u200956). International collaborations featured in 53.33% of studies, led by the US (n\u2009=\u200956), UK (n\u2009=\u200925), and South Africa (n\u2009=\u200920). Johns Hopkins University was the top institution (n\u2009=\u200956), and Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy the leading journal (n\u2009=\u200915). Landmark 2019 publications had the highest citation rate (13.05/year). Thematic analysis revealed categorization into three domains: pathogen and drug resistance, treatment regimens and efficacy, and demographics and clinical studies. Strong collaborations linked high-income and high-burden countries, notably the US and South Africa.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This first bibliometric assessment of BPaL/BPaLM research highlights progress in evidence generation but reveals gaps in implementation science and equitable knowledge production. Future work should address operational challenges, special populations, and resistance monitoring. These insights can guide researchers, policymakers, and funders to optimize TB control programs and advance global elimination goals.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Ultrasound-guided vascular access (USGVA) is an essential clinical skill, but novice learners often face difficulties in interpreting ultrasound images and achieving spatial alignment during procedures. To address this challenge, we hypothesized that using a reversed screen orientation could facilitate the learning process. Reversed screen orientation refers to an ultrasound image flipped in the transverse plane, producing a top-to-bottom mirror image by activating the \"reverse\" function on the ultrasound (US) device. We assumed that this configuration might help align the visual trajectory of the needle with the user's hand movements, potentially easing spatial perception during the early stages of learning.<h4>Metods</h4>The study was conducted in the Anatomy Laboratory of Ordu University Medical Faculty with 60 final-year medical students with no prior US experience. Participants were randomly divided into two groups (A and B), who performed femoral vein needle punctures on cadavers under US guidance with standard (Group A) and reverse (Group B) screen. Each group used both screen orientations across two attempts. Before the procedure, students received theoretical training. Data collected included demographic information, needle visibility, procedure duration, success rates, and complications. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and significance was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed no significant differences in age or sex distribution between groups. In the first attempt, 83.3% of participants with posterior wall penetration were in Group A (standard screen orientation). Needle visualibity score was higher in Group B (reversed screen orientation). The perceived ease of the procedure showed a significant difference in favor of Group B in the second attempt. Overall, while the success rates and time taken were similar between groups, Group B exhibited improved needle visualization and fewer complications related to posterior wall penetration.<h4>Discussion</h4>The findings indicate that reversed screen orientation may facilitate learning and enhance procedural outcomes in USGVA. This orientation aligns better with the spatial perception of needle movement, potentially improving hand-eye coordination. The study supports the integration of reversed screen techniques in US training to improve skill acquisition and reduce complication rates in vascular access procedures. However, limitations include the study being conducted at a single center and using only one cadaver, which may affect the generalizability of results. Future research should explore long-term effects and further validate these findings in diverse clinical settings.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Surgical process modeling (SPM) presents a rigorous ontology and useful means of understanding complex surgical workflows. Early-stage understanding of the potential benefit of emerging technologies can be gained with such an approach- for example, in image-guided spine surgery.<h4>Purpose</h4>This work extends SPM ontology to a statistical framework for computational modeling and simulation, analyzing the effect of new technologies on quantitative outcomes. Two example use cases are detailed in spine surgery-target localization with long-length imaging and pedicle screw placement with intraoperative CT and navigation.<h4>Methods</h4>The SPM ontology of phase, step, and activity was mapped to a directed graph depiction of workflow in which activities were described by statistical distributions in outcomes, parameterized and validated via retrospective and/or prospective studies, and structured within an SPM table and object-oriented computational framework. The approach was applied to quantify the influence of two example technologies in spine surgery: (1) long-length radiographic imaging for target localization (compared to conventional fluoroscopic level-counting); and (2) intraoperative CT and 3D navigation for pedicle screw placement (compared to conventional fluoroscopic guidance). Distributions in cycle time, radiation dose, and geometric accuracy were investigated, with clear depiction of median and outlier performance provided by 3D visualization.<h4>Results</h4>Statistical SPMs yielded insight on complex workflows and the potential benefits of emerging technologies. For target localization, intraoperative long-length imaging reduced median cycle time from 15.5\u00a0min (for fluoroscopic level-counting) to 13.4\u00a0min and eliminated outliers associated with visibility of markers or human error. For pedicle screw placement, 3D navigation introduced an additional median\u2009~\u200915\u00a0min procedural overhead in planning and registration but reduced median procedure time from 229\u00a0min (for fluoroscopy guidance) to 180\u00a0min. 3D navigation also quantifiably improved the geometric accuracy of screw placement and reduced the frequency of pedicle screw breach (Grade C or worse).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Statistical SPMs provide a valuable methodology to evaluate and communicate complex interventional workflows and the potential benefit of emerging technologies. Two SPM use cases were developed in the context of spine surgery and provided a basis for investigating the potential performance of emerging technologies, such as intraoperative imaging, navigation, robotic assistance, and augmented reality systems. As a framework for virtual clinical trials, statistical SPMs can provide insight on outcome measures that are difficult to evaluate in the laboratory and expensive / time-consuming to measure in prospective clinical studies.",

      "abstractText": "The adrenal glands are small but vital endocrine organs responsible for hormone production, which is essential for stress response, fluid balance, and blood pressure regulation. Adrenalectomy, the surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands, is indicated in various benign and malignant conditions such as pheochromocytomas, aldosterone-producing adenomas, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Historically performed via open surgery, adrenalectomy has evolved significantly with the introduction of laparoscopic adrenalectomy in the 1990s and more recently, robotic adrenalectomy. Robotic adrenalectomy enhances surgical precision through 3D visualization, articulated instruments, and improved ergonomics, thereby addressing the limitations inherent to laparoscopic adrenalectomy. This narrative review synthesises the findings from pivotal studies that compare the perioperative outcomes of robotic adrenalectomy and laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Robotic adrenalectomy demonstrates favourable outcomes in terms of operative precision, reduced estimated blood loss, and comparable or shorter hospital stay, especially in complex scenarios involving obesity, large tumours, or altered anatomy. Complication rates remain low, and R0 resection rates exceed 95% in well-selected malignancies, supporting the oncological adequacy of robotic adrenalectomies. While robotic adrenalectomy offers superior surgeon ergonomics and a relatively short learning curve, its high initial costs and lack of tactile feedback present notable limitations. Technological advancements, including high-definition 3D optics, fluorescence imaging, and artificial intelligence integration, have further refined the potential of robotic adrenalectomies. However, the evidence remains largely retrospective, with limited prospective randomised trials evaluating long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Robotic adrenalectomy appears to be particularly advantageous in complex adrenal cases, offering a safe, minimally invasive option with the potential for improved recovery and surgical outcomes. Future research should focus on the long-term oncologic efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and economic sustainability of robotic adrenalectomy in diverse clinical settings. Robotic adrenalectomy represents a significant milestone in adrenal surgery, with growing evidence supporting its selective use as a preferred approach in experienced centres and in appropriately chosen patients.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Decision-making for maxillary sinus floor elevation (MSFE) surgery in patients with low residual bone height (<4 mm) presents significant challenges, particularly in selecting surgical approaches and predicting intraoperative mucosal perforation. Traditional methods rely heavily on physician experience, lack standardization and objectivity, and often fail to meet the demands of precision medicine. This study aims to build an intelligent decision-making system based on deep learning to optimize surgical selection and predict the risk of mucosal perforation, providing clinicians with a reliable auxiliary tool.<h4>Methods</h4>This study retrospectively analysed the cone-beam computed tomography imaging data of 79 patients who underwent MSFE and constructed a three-dimensional (3D) deep-learning model based on the overall CT data of the patients for surgical procedure selection and prediction of mucosal perforation. The model innovatively introduced the Convolutional Block Attention Module mechanism and depthwise separable convolution technology to enhance the model's ability to capture spatial features and computational efficiency. The model was rigorously trained and validated on multiple datasets, with visualization achieved through attention heatmaps to improve interpretability.<h4>Results</h4>The modified EfficientNet model achieved an F1 score of 0.6 in the procedure decision task of MSFE. For predicting mucosal perforation, the improved ResNet model achieved an accuracy of 0.8485 and an F1-score of 0.7273 on the mixed dataset. In the experimental group, the improved ResNet model achieved an accuracy of 0.8235, a recall of 0.7619, and an F1-score of 0.7302. In the control group, the model also maintained stable performance, with an F1-score of 0.6483. Overall, the 3D convolutional model enhanced the accuracy and stability of mucosal perforation prediction by leveraging the spatial features of cone-beam computed tomography imaging, demonstrating a certain degree of generalization capability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study is the first to construct a deep learning-based 3D intelligent decision-making model for MSFE. These findings confirm the model's effectiveness in surgical decision-making and in predicting the risk of mucosal perforation. The system provides an objective decision-making basis for clinicians, improves the standardization level of complex case management, and demonstrates potential for clinical application.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Robotic gastrectomy has emerged as a potential advancement over laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer, offering enhanced precision through three-dimensional visualization and articulated instrumentation. However, its clinical superiority remains controversial.<h4>Methods</h4>This review was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database (ID: CRD420251133133). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing robotic gastrectomy (RG) with laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) for gastric adenocarcinoma. Literature searches across six databases identified eligible RCTs until January 2025. The primary outcomes included operative time, postoperative complications, blood loss, and lymph node harvest. The secondary outcomes included recovery parameters and hospital stay. Evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE methodology.<h4>Results</h4>Four RCTs encompassing 919 patients (480 RG, 439 LG) met the inclusion criteria. RG significantly reduced overall postoperative complications (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.93, P\u2009=\u20090.03), shortened hospital stay (MD -\u00a00.88\u00a0days, 95% CI -\u00a01.21 to -\u00a00.55, P\u2009<\u20090.00001), and accelerated bowel function recovery (MD -\u00a00.52\u00a0days, 95% CI -\u00a01.00 to -\u00a00.05, P\u2009=\u20090.03) and oral intake (MD -\u00a00.52\u00a0days, 95% CI -\u00a01.01 to -\u00a00.03, P\u2009=\u20090.04). However, operative time was significantly longer (MD\u2009+\u200916.95\u00a0min, 95% CI 10.93-22.98, P\u2009<\u20090.00001). Severe complications, anastomotic leakage, reoperation rates, blood loss, and lymph node yield were comparable between the approaches. GRADE assessment revealed moderate certainty for hospital stay reduction and low-to-very-low certainty for other outcomes due to heterogeneity and methodological limitations of the studies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Across four RCTs conducted in high-volume East Asian centers, robotic gastrectomy demonstrates superior perioperative recovery with reduced overall complications and accelerated rehabilitation compared with laparoscopic surgery, despite longer operative times. Oncological adequacy remains equivalent across approaches. Generalizability to Western case-mix and perioperative pathways remains uncertain.",

      "abstractText": "This study aims to investigate the association between lung function and various types of sensory impairments (specifically visual and hearing impairments) in the elderly population in the middle-aged and older adults in China. This study utilizes data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from the 2011 and 2015 waves of interviews. Participants aged 45 and older with complete data were included in the study. Lung function was assessed using peak expiratory flow (PEF). Multivariable logistic regression and trend regression models analyzed the cross-sectional relationships between PEF, predicted PEF values, and various sensory impairments (SI) The study also examined the prospective relationship between baseline PEF and sensory impairment deterioration using restricted cubic splines for visualization. Finally, subgroup analyses were performed to validate the results' stability. The cross-sectional analysis, after adjusting for confounders, revealed that higher baseline and predicted PEF values were associated with a lower prevalence of SI. This inverse relationship was consistent across various types of impairments, including visual impairment, distance vision impairment, near vision impairment, and hearing impairment. The trend ORs were as follows: (Baseline PEF: 0.894 [0.846, 0.945], 0.881 [0.839, 0.926], 0.922 [0.878, 0.969], and 0.916 [0.873, 0.961]; Predicted PEF %: 0.829 [0.786, 0.874], 0.755 [0.719, 0.791], 0.872 [0.831, 0.914], and 0.770 [0.735, 0.806]). In the combined analysis of sensory impairment types, including single sensory impairment (SSI) and dual sensory impairment (DSI), higher PEF values were also linked to lower prevalence rates. The trend ORs for baseline PEF were 0.924 [0.862, 0.990] and 0.884 [0.826, 0.945], and for predicted PEF % values, the trend ORs were 0.915[0.853, 0.981] and 0.775 [0.725, 0.829]. During follow-up, baseline PEF was significantly associated with the deterioration of Non-SI to DSI. Specifically, the adjusted OR for Q4 relative to Q1 was 0.609 [0.397, 0.933], with a trend OR of 0.862 [0.751, 0.988]. Changes in PEF and predicted PEF percentage values during follow-up were not significantly associated with worsening SI. Subgroup analyses indicated that the inverse relationship between PEF and sensory impairments was significant across various age groups, genders, smoking statuses, and lung disease backgrounds, though the correlation was weaker in non-smokers and individuals with lung diseases. Higher PEF values are associated with a lower prevalence of various sensory impairments and a reduced risk of worsening these impairments in middle-aged and older adults. This study supports the effective screening of SI, particularly in identifying high-risk individuals who may experience the progression of DSI.",

      "abstractText": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent cancer globally with a poor prognosis. Nanomedicine applications are expected to enhance early detection, improve cytotoxic drug utilization, and improve HCC prognosis. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research on nanomedicines in HCC, focusing on current hotspots and exploring future development directions. By searching Web of Science, we collected 4,372 English-language articles from January 1, 2012 to October 31, 2022. China emerged as the leading contributor with 2,473 publications (55.6%), followed by the US (299, 6.8%) and India (284, 6.5%). Sun Yat-sen University had the highest number of publications. The most cited journal was the INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE, and BIOMATERIALS was the most influential based on H/g/m indices. Key research areas included NANOPARTICLES (11% of keyword occurrences), HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA (8% ), and DRUG-DELIVERY (6%). in-vitro drug-delivery research remains a potential area. This study reveals that nanomedicines have significant potential in improving HCC early detection, drug-use efficiency, and prognosis. Encapsulating cytotoxic drugs in nanoparticles is a predominant research hotspot, while nanoparticle toxicity's impact on human systems may be a promising future direction. These findings provide valuable insights for guiding future research and clinical translation in HCC nanomedicine.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Context</h4>Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease endemic to over 100 countries, poses a serious health risk to people living in tropical regions. The viral non-structural proteins NS3 (helicase) and NS5 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) are critical targets for antiviral drug development. Several natural and synthetic compounds have been tried against this for the screening of antiviral inhibitor(s) but so far limited success has been achieved. In this study, we have investigated how natural products interact with and destabilize NS3 and NS5. We used in silico methods to screen new potential NS3 and NS5 inhibitors from various anti-cancer flavonoid compounds that previously showed anti-cancer properties in vitro. A virtual screening was conducted on 329 anti-cancer flavonoid compounds, selecting 190 compounds based on Lipinski's rule of five, the Muegge filter, the Ghose filter, and the Veber filter. Molecular docking techniques allowed us to identify Artobiloxanthone (PubChem CID: 46887866) as the most effective binder for NS3, while Glabridin (PubChem CID: 124052) emerged as the most effective binder for NS5. These leading candidates demonstrated favorable ADMET profiles. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of up to 1000-ns showcased stable protein-ligand interactions, with convergence achieved at 200\u00a0ns for NS3 and 470\u00a0ns for NS5. The structural stability of the complexes was validated by analyzing root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding). Binding affinity between the ligand and target proteins was further validated by binding free energy calculations using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) approach, providing a robust estimation of interaction stability. These findings highlight the potential of Artobiloxanthone and Glabridin as promising inhibitors of dengue virus replication.<h4>Methods</h4>The Chimera v1.11.2 program was employed for protein optimization, while PyRx 0.8 served for molecular docking. Protein structures were converted into.pdbqt format, and ligands were energy-minimized using the MMFF94 force field and conjugate gradient optimization. Visualization was conducted using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer and PyMOL. The ADMET properties of the top hits were predicted using the pkCSM and ProTox-II platforms. To address missing residues in the crystal structures, AlphaFold2 was used to predict full-length protein models. MD simulations were performed with the GROMACS 2024.5 package, utilizing the AMBER-f99SB-ILDN force field, the TIP3P water model, and a 120\u00a0mM NaCl concentration. Equilibration was achieved through V-rescale and C-rescale thermostats, followed by Parrinello-Rahman barostat production runs. Analysis of the MD trajectories included RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, H-bonding, and MM-PBSA utilizing GROMACS tools, gmx_MMPBSA, VMD, and MDAnalysis.",

      "abstractText": "As a total ankle replacement (TAR) prosthesis has been developed and improved in terms of design and surgical technique, it could be expected to lead to a successful functional outcome in the ankle joint. However, several complications of the TAR procedure may be often caused by an incomplete understanding of the abnormal biomechanics of the ankle joint and the prosthesis design of the TAR. This study was performed to suggest a novel approach to determine the TAR prosthesis size by using an orthopedic digital templating software based on a comparison between X-ray and CT images. This study was examined in a novel approach to determine the prosthesis size by using an orthopedic digital templating software (Orthoview\u2122, Florida, USA) based on the comparison between X-ray and CT images. A total 6 types of clinical foot and ankle images were obtained from x-ray and CT of 55 subjects in the coronal and sagittal plane. The x-ray images magnified as 100% and 115% based on the CT images. All subjects were diagnosed to the ankle osteoarthritis with stage 2-4 according to Takakura's ankle OA classification. To predict the appropriate component sizes of the TAR prosthesis, the same TAR prosthesis (HINTEGRA, Newdeal, France) was chosen, and the tibial and the the talar component sizes were selected until by adapting to the osteotomized range of the tibia and talus. The unskilled surgeons predicted the sizes of the TAR components before procedure by using the orthopedic digital templating software. These predicted sizes were then compared with the selected sizes by the specialist surgeon during the procedure. The Cohen's Kappa correlation coefficient was applied to statistically analyze the agreement between the predicted and selected sizes of the TAR components for unskilled and specialist surgeons, respectively. On the CT images, the average agreement rate was relatively higher than on the x-ray images at over 77%. Especially, highest agreement rate was shown at the tibial component in the coronal plane with almost 80%, followed by over 75% in the sagittal plane. In the talar part, the agreement rate was shown to be over 76% in the coronal and sagittal plane, respectively. Overall, the predicted size from the CT image was more consistent with the size selected by the specialist surgeon than the X-ray image. In conclusion, the application of the orthopedic digital templating software based on CT images may expect to provide more complete and detailed visualization to predict the appropriate size of the TAR components than conventional X-ray images which would be limited by relatively lower sensitivity and specificity as well as overlapping the adjacent bones.",
