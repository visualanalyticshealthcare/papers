      "abstractText": "The presence of Hg<sup>2+</sup> causes substantial stress to plants, adversely affecting growth and health by disrupting cell cycle divisions, photosynthesis, and ionic homeostasis. Accurate visualization of the spatiotemporal distribution of Hg<sup>2+</sup> in plant tissues is crucial for the management of Hg pollution; however, the related research is still at its early stage. Herein, a small-molecule amphiphilic fluorescent probe (termed <b>LJTP2</b>) was developed for the specific detection of Hg<sup>2+</sup> with a high sensitivity (~16 nM). Fluorescent imaging applications with <b>LJTP2</b> not only detected the dynamic distribution of Hg<sup>2+</sup> within plant cells at the subcellular level but also enabled the understanding of cell membrane health under Hg<sup>2+</sup> stress. This study introduces a valuable imaging tool for elucidating the molecular mechanism of Hg<sup>2+</sup> stress in plants, demonstrating the potential of the application of small-molecule fluorescent probes in plant science.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background and importance</h4>Superior oblique myokymia (SOM) is a rare, acquired aberration of the innervation of the superior oblique, resulting in episodic monocular contraction of the superior oblique muscle characterized by intermittent rotatory eye movement causing diplopia and oscillopsia. Several treatment modalities have been described to treat SOM, including medication and surgical interventions. There is a paucity of reports describing microvascular decompression (MVD) of the trochlear nerve near the root entry zone for the treatment of a neurovascular conflict. The authors describe a case report of a patient who presented with SOM by a supracerebellar infratentorial approach using microscopic and endoscopic visualization.<h4>Clinical presentation</h4>A 40-year-old woman presented with an 8-month history of rhythmic contractions of her right orbit with worsening double vision and occasional balance issues. Neuro-ophthalmological evaluation which revealed a right-sided SOM. MRI evaluation demonstrated a potential vascular compression by the superior cerebellar artery near the origin of the trochlear nerve. She underwent MVD by a supracerebellar infratentorial approach using microscopic and endoscopic visualization. The patient experienced resolution of her SOM in the immediate postoperative period and a Trochlear nerve palsy that resolved within 6 months.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The endoscopic supracerebellar infratentorial approach for MVD of the trochlear nerve is a safe and efficacious approach that provides superior visualization of the trochlear nerve at its origin and in the setting of SOM. This approach shows outcomes comparable with those used in previously described cases.",

Interview transcripts were analyzed using generative AI (ChatGPT-4o) and human researchers for thematic, emotional, and subjectivity analysis. A comparison between AI and human analysis was performed, and data visualization techniques, including keyword co-occurrence networks and cluster analysis, were employed to identify patterns and relationships.<h4>Results</h4>Key themes such as patient care, surgical safety, and nursing skills were identified through thematic analysis. Emotional analysis revealed a range of tones, with AI providing an efficient overview and human researchers capturing nuanced emotional insights. High subjectivity scores indicated deeply personal reflections. Keyword co-occurrence networks and cluster analysis highlighted connections between themes and distinct emotional experiences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Combining generative AI with human expertise offered nuanced insights into the emotions of operating room nurses. The findings emphasize the importance of emotional support, effective communication, and safety protocols in improving nurse well-being and job satisfaction. This hybrid approach can help address emotional challenges, reduce burnout, and enhance retention rates. Future research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to validate these findings and explore the broader applications of AI in healthcare.",

      "abstractText": "Data-driven models of neurons and circuits are important for understanding how the properties of membrane conductances, synapses, dendrites, and the anatomical connectivity between neurons generate the complex dynamical behaviors of brain circuits in health and disease. However, the inherent complexity of these biological processes makes the construction and reuse of biologically detailed models challenging. A wide range of tools have been developed to aid their construction and simulation, but differences in design and internal representation act as technical barriers to those who wish to use data-driven models in their research workflows. NeuroML, a model description language for computational neuroscience, was developed to address this fragmentation in modeling tools. Since its inception, NeuroML has evolved into a mature community standard that encompasses a wide range of model types and approaches in computational neuroscience. It has enabled the development of a large ecosystem of interoperable open-source software tools for the creation, visualization, validation, and simulation of data-driven models. Here, we describe how the NeuroML ecosystem can be incorporated into research workflows to simplify the construction, testing, and analysis of standardized models of neural systems, and supports the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, thus promoting open, transparent and reproducible science.",

      "abstractText": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play pivotal roles in regulating cellular signaling, fine-tuning protein function, and orchestrating complex biological processes. Despite their importance, the lack of comprehensive tools for studying PTMs from a pathway-centric perspective has limited our ability to understand how PTMs modulate cellular pathways on a molecular level. Here, we present PTMNavigator, a tool integrated into the ProteomicsDB platform that offers an interactive interface for researchers to overlay experimental PTM data with pathway diagrams. PTMNavigator provides ~3000 canonical pathways from manually curated databases, enabling users to modify and create custom diagrams tailored to their data. Additionally, PTMNavigator automatically runs kinase and pathway enrichment algorithms whose results are directly integrated into the visualization. This offers a comprehensive view of the intricate relationship between PTMs and signaling pathways. We demonstrate the utility of PTMNavigator by applying it to two phosphoproteomics datasets, showing how it can enhance pathway enrichment analysis, visualize how drug treatments result in a discernable flow of PTM-driven signaling, and aid in proposing extensions to existing pathways. By enhancing our understanding of cellular signaling dynamics and facilitating the discovery of PTM-pathway interactions, PTMNavigator advances our knowledge of PTM biology and its implications in health and disease.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Social media is used as a tool for information exchange, entertainment, education, and intervention. Intervention efforts attempt to engage users in skin health.<h4>Objective</h4>This review aimed to collect and summarize research assessing the impact of social media on skin health promotion activities undertaken by social media users.<h4>Methods</h4>In accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, the following scientific databases were searched: Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate (via EBSCO), Academic Research Source eJournals (via EBSCO), ERIC (via EBSCO), Health Source: Consumer Edition (via EBSCO), and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition (via EBSCO). Using ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, OpenGrey, Grey Literature Report, and MedNar, the search was supplemented with gray literature. Articles on skin care, skin health, skin diseases, skin protection, and educational activities promoting healthy skin on social media were selected for review (search date: February 6, 2023). The following qualification criteria were used: original research; research conducted on social media; and research topics regarding educational activities in skin health promotion, skin care, skin health, skin diseases, and skin protection. To assess the risk of bias, the following tools were used: the Cochrane Collaboration tool for risk-of-bias assessment (randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies) and the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine checklist (cross-sectional studies).<h4>Results</h4>Altogether, 1558 works were considered, of which 23 (1.48%) qualified, with 3 (13%) studies on acne and 20 (87%) on skin cancer, sunscreen, and tanning. Social media interventions were dealt with in 65% (15/23) of the studies. The review made it possible to investigate cognitive and cognitive-behavioral interventions. In both observational and interventional studies, the most frequently discussed topics were skin exposure and protection against UV radiation and skin cancer. The analyzed research showed that social media is a source of information. Visualization has a strong impact on users. The involvement of social media users is measured through the amount of content shared and contributes to changing attitudes and behaviors regarding skin health.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This review outlined the impact of social media, despite its heterogeneity, on users' skin health behaviors, attitudes, and actions. It identified strategies for digital interventions to promote skin health. In health sciences, a standardized tool is needed to assess the quality of social media digital interventions. This review has several limitations: only articles written in English were considered; ongoing studies were omitted; and there was a small number of interventional studies on acne and a lack of research on daily skin care, education, and antiaging activities on social media. Another limitation, resulting from the topic being too broad, was a failure to perform quantitative data analysis, resulting in the studies that qualified for the review being heterogeneous.",

      "abstractText": "Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, is linked to cancer progression in estrogen-responsive tissues, but its role in promoting colorectal cancer (CRC) progression in the context of obesity remains underexplored. This study examines BPA's influence on CRC in obese Sprague-Dawley rats using network toxicology and experimental models. Computational analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery identified pathways such as \"CRC\" and \"chemical carcinogenesis-receptor activation\", implicating the PI3K-AKT pathway in IL-1 beta upregulation and BPA's role in CRC during obesity. Thirty male rats were grouped (n\u202f=\u202f6) as follows: N (normal diet), NC (normal diet + CRC), HC (high-fat diet + CRC), NCB (normal diet + CRC\u202f+\u202fBPA), and HCB (high-fat diet + CRC\u202f+\u202fBPA). CRC was induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (40\u202fmg/kg), and BPA (25\u202fmg/kg) was administered for 19\u202fweeks. Although BPA exposure did not affect body weight or biochemical parameters, the HCB group exhibited significant histopathological changes in the colon, including lymphoid hyperplasia, liver damage, and increased IL-1\u03b2 levels. Furthermore, diet influenced adipocyte size, exacerbating BPA's effects on CRC progression. Findings suggest BPA may worsen CRC progression in obese rats through identified pathways, promoting multi-organ pathology and underscoring the need for stricter regulations, especially for vulnerable populations. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: Bisphenol A (BPA), a widespread environmental contaminant, is increasingly linked to serious health issues, including cancer, in susceptible populations. Our study highlights BPA's role in promoting obesity-driven colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, demonstrating its carcinogenic potential in high-risk contexts. These findings emphasize the urgent need for regulatory scrutiny of BPA exposure, particularly in obese individuals, and support the development of safer alternatives. Addressing BPA's impact can contribute to preventive health strategies and inform policies aimed at reducing environmental and public health risks associated with endocrine-disrupting chemicals.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Elderly individuals living alone represent a vulnerable group with limited family support, making them more susceptible to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. This study aims to construct a network model of depression and anxiety symptoms among older adults living alone, exploring the correlations and centrality of different symptoms. The goal is to identify core and bridging symptoms to inform clinical interventions.<h4>Methods</h4>Using data from the 2018 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), this study constructed a network model of depression and anxiety symptoms among elderly individuals living alone. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-10 (CESD-10) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), respectively. A Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) was employed to build the symptom network, and the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm was used for visualization, with the thickness and color of the edges representing partial correlations between symptoms. To minimize spurious correlations, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method was applied for regularization, and the optimal regularization parameters were selected using the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC). We further calculated Expected Influence (EI) and Bridge Expected Influence (Bridge EI) to evaluate the importance of symptoms. Non-parametric bootstrap methods were used to assess the stability and accuracy of the network.<h4>Results</h4>The Network centrality analysis revealed that GAD2 (Uncontrollable worry) and GAD4 (Trouble relaxing) exhibited the highest strength centrality (1.128 and 1.102, respectively), indicating their significant direct associations with other symptoms and their roles as core nodes in the anxiety symptom network. Other highly central nodes, such as GAD1 (Nervousness or anxiety) and GAD3 (Generalized worry), further underscore the dominance of anxiety symptoms in the overall network. Betweenness centrality results highlighted GAD1 (Nervousness or anxiety) and GAD2 (Uncontrollable worry) as critical bridge nodes facilitating information flow between different symptoms, while CESD3 (Feeling depressed) demonstrated a bridging role across modules. Weighted analyses further confirmed the central importance of GAD2 (Uncontrollable worry) and GAD4 (Trouble relaxing). Additionally, the analysis showed gender differences in the depression-anxiety networks of elderly individuals living alone.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study, through network analysis, uncovered the complex relationships between depression and anxiety symptoms among elderly individuals living alone, identifying GAD2 (Uncontrollable worry) and GAD4 (Trouble relaxing) as core symptoms. These findings provide essential insights for targeted interventions. Future research should explore intervention strategies for these symptoms to improve the mental health of elderly individuals living alone.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Current scapular free flap (SFF) harvest in mandibular reconstruction often requires repositioning, hindering simultaneous harvest and resection and potentially increasing ischemic time. This study evaluated the efficacy of the pull-through technique (PTT) for SFF harvest, aiming to reduce ischemic time during mandibular segmental resection.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective analysis was conducted on 24 patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction using SFF at two maxillofacial surgery departments between January 2015 and May 2022. In total, 13 patients received PTT, while the remaining 11 underwent non-PTT. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including age, sex, diagnosis, resected mandibular segments, operative time, and ischemic time. Statistical analysis was performed to compare these variables between the PTT and non-PTT groups.<h4>Results</h4>The study found no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, sex, diagnosis, number of resected segments, or total operative time. However, ischemic time was significantly shorter in the PTT group than in the non-PTT group. PTT also allowed for minimal position changes during surgery compared with non-PTT.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study investigated the impact of the PTT on SFF reconstruction during mandibular segmental resection. We found that utilizing PTT-SFF significantly reduced ischemic time compared with the traditional method. This technique offers a potential advantage by facilitating stable blood flow visualization and potentially improving flap viability.<h4>Clinical trial number</h4>Not applicable.",

      "abstractText": "<i>Objective</i>. Brain-computer interface(BCI) is leveraged by artificial intelligence in EEG signal decoding, which makes it possible to become a new means of human-machine interaction. However, the performance of current EEG decoding methods is still insufficient for clinical applications because of inadequate EEG information extraction and limited computational resources in hospitals. This paper introduces a hybrid network that employs a transformer with modified locally linear embedding and sliding window convolution for EEG decoding.<i>Approach</i>. This network separately extracts channel and temporal features from EEG signals, subsequently fusing these features using a cross-attention mechanism. Simultaneously, manifold learning is employed to lower the computational burden of the model by mapping the high-dimensional EEG data to a low-dimensional space by its dimension reduction function.<i>Main results</i>. The proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 84.44%, 94.96%, and 82.79% on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a, high gamma dataset, and a self-constructed motor imagery (MI) dataset from the left and right hand fist-clenching tests respectively. The results indicate our model outperforms the baseline models by EEG-channel transformer with dimension-reduced EEG data and window attention with sliding window convolution. Additionally, to enhance the interpretability of the model, features preceding the temporal feature extraction network were visualized. This visualization promotes the understanding of how the model prefers task-related channels.<i>Significance</i>. The transformer-based method makes the MI-EEG decoding more practical for further clinical applications.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Noma is a severe orofacial disease with high mortality and morbidity. Although severity scales exist, they fail to fully capture the extent of damage caused by the disease.<h4>Methods</h4>This study analysed 404 photos of 260 noma cases from Facing Africa (n=228) and Project Harar (n=32) to create a new severity classification system. Photos were displayed on a large screen for better visualization. Tissue damage was assessed in terms of width, depth and surface area using the American Burn Association's grading system. A mathematical formula was also developed to quantify the extent of noma-induced orofacial damage.<h4>Results</h4>Fifteen orofacial anatomical units vulnerable to noma were identified, leading to the development of a new severity classification system that enhances the assessment of noma. This system evaluates tissue damage qualitatively as minor, moderate or major and quantitatively using a purpose-built mathematical formula.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Current classification systems inadequately capture noma severity due to vague definitions and limited consideration of the affected anatomical units. The new approach addresses these gaps by considering all tissue damage, including dentition, and allows for precise qualitative and quantitative assessment of disease severity. Continued research and validation are essential to refine this method, improving its clinical and research applications and enhancing outcomes for noma patients worldwide.",

      "abstractText": "We have developed a 3-D acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) prostate imaging system to identify regions suspicious for cancer and guide a targeted prostate biopsy in a single visit. The system uses a side-fire transrectal probe and an automated rotation stage to acquire ARFI and B-mode image volumes, combined with 3-D visualization and targeting software to enable biopsy target identification and guide a transperineal (TP) biopsy. The system was tested in the first clinical trial of its kind, with subjects serially undergoing ARFI-guided targeted TP biopsy, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-ultrasound fusion TP biopsy, and systematic sampling TP biopsy. The findings indicate that the ARFI system is feasible for guiding a targeted biopsy. For lower-grade cancer (grade groups [GG] 1-2), ARFI underperformed mpMRI and systematic sampling, detecting cancer in 54% of GG 2 subjects. However, ARFI performance improved with increasing cancer grade; for higher-grade cancer (GG 3-5), ARFI performed comparably to the other biopsy approaches, and detected cancer in all GG 4 and 5 subjects. The findings also suggest the benefit of using 2-D ARFI imaging to confirm target location during live B-mode imaging, which could improve existing ultrasonic fusion biopsy workflows.

      "abstractText": "The global burden of cancer continues to grow, posing a significant public health challenge. Although cancer immunotherapy has shown significant efficacy, the response rate is not high. Therefore, the objective of our research was to identify the latest research trends and hotspots on biomarkers from 1993 to 2023. Data were collected from the database Web of Science core collection. Bibliometric analysis and visualization were conducted with CiteSpace(6.3.1), VOSviewer (v1.6.20), R-bibliometrix(v4.3.3), and Microsoft Excel(2019). A total of 2686 literatures were retrieved. The sheer annual volume of publications has shown a rapid upward trend since 2015. The United States has generated the most publications and Harvard University ranked as a leading institution. The global biomarker research on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) revealed regional differences and in-depth explorations should be promoted in developing countries. Although China has become the second largest country in terms of publication, the average citation per paper and the total link strength were both lower than the other countries. The research on biomarkers mainly concentrated upon the following aspects: PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4, gene expression, adverse events, total mutational burden (TMB), body mass index (BMI), gut microbiota, cd8(+)/cd4(+) t-cells, and blood-related biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), cytokines. Furthermore, \"artificial intelligence\" and \"machine learning\" have become the most important research hotspot over the last 2 y, which will help us to identify useful biomarkers from complex big data and provide a basis for precise medicine for malignant tumors.",

The cervical neck angulation of the operating surgeon was recorded in real-time with an inertia measurement unit system (Mbient, San Francisco, USA) and experiences of the surgeon and assistant were prospectively evaluated with 5-point Likert scales.National Health Service, England.Eleven patients were recruited in whom 12 procedures were performed. Two main surgeons, 3 assistant surgeons, and 3 scrub nurses were recruited into the study.Four procedures were performed with the VITOM<sup>\u00ae</sup> 3D exoscope, and as the comparison groups, 5 procedures were performed with normal loupes, 3 with prism loupes, and 2 were done in combination with a microscope and analyzed separately.Neck angle measurements and feedback from surgeons, assistants, and scrub nurses.The VITOM<sup>\u00ae</sup> system improved surgeon ergonomics with reduced procedure time in cervical flexion when compared to the other visualization methods (versus loupes, <i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.01, and prism, <i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.01). The VITOM<sup>\u00ae</sup> system also scored favorably in terms of image-related fields, ergonomics, and ease of use.Use of the 3D exoscope in cleft surgery yielded improved experiences for both surgeons, assistants, and nurses in comparison with loupes and microscopes without increasing operating time.",

      "abstractText": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising agents for treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Although discovering novel AMPs is crucial for combating multidrug-resistant bacteria and biofilm-related infections, their clinical potential relies on precise, real-time evaluation of efficacy, toxicity, and mechanisms. Optical diffraction tomography (ODT), a label-free imaging technology, enables real-time visualization of bacterial morphological changes, membrane damage, and biofilm formation over time. Here, a computational analysis of the leech transcriptome using an advanced AI-based peptide screening strategy with ODT to identify potential AMPs is employed. Among the 19 potential AMPs identified, hirunipin 2 demonstrates potent antibacterial activity, low mammalian cytotoxicity, and minimal hemolytic effects. It demonstrates efficacy comparable to melittin, resistance to physiological salts and human serum, and a low likelihood of inducing bacterial resistance. Microscopy and 3D-ODT confirm its disruption of bacterial membranes and intracellular aggregation, leading to cell death. Notably, hirunipin 2 effectively inhibits biofilm formation, eradicates preformed biofilms, and synergizes with antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) by enhancing membrane permeability. Additionally, hirunipin 2 significantly suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages, highlighting its anti-inflammatory properties. These findings highlight hirunipin 2 as a strong candidate for developing novel antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antibiofilm therapies, particularly against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.",

      "abstractText": "Accurate prediction of drug-drug interaction (DDI) is essential to improve clinical efficacy, avoid adverse effects of drug combination therapy, and enhance drug safety. Recently researchers have developed several computer-aided methods for DDI prediction. However, these methods lack the substructural features that are critical to drug interactions and are not effective in generalizing across domains and different distribution data. In this work, we present SAGAN, a domain adaptive interpretable substructure-aware graph attention network for DDI prediction. Based on attention mechanism and unsupervised clustering algorithm, we propose a new substructure segmentation method, which segments the drug molecule into multiple substructures, learns the mechanism of drug interaction from the perspective of interaction, and identifies important interaction regions between drugs. To enhance the generalization ability of the model, we improve and apply a conditional domain adversarial network to achieve cross-domain generalization by alternately optimizing the cross-entropy loss on the source domain and the adversarial loss of the domain discriminator. We evaluate and compare SAGAN with the state-of-the-art DDI prediction model on four real-world datasets for both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and show that SAGAN achieves the best overall performance. Moreover, the visualization results of the model show that SAGAN has achieved pharmacologically significant substructure extraction, which can help drug developers screen for some undiscovered local interaction sites, and provide important information for further drug structure optimization. The codes and datasets are available online at https://github.com/wyx2012/SAGAN .",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>An all-inside endoscopic flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon transfer is indicated for the treatment of chronic, full-thickness Achilles tendon defects. The aim of this procedure is to restore function of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex while avoiding the wound complications associated with open procedures.<h4>Description</h4>This procedure can be performed through 2 endoscopic portals, a posteromedial portal (the working portal) and a posterolateral portal (the visualization portal). The FHL tendon is identified, and the joint capsule is debrided to identify the subtalar joint. A shaver is utilized to circumferentially debride the FHL at the level of the subtalar joint, allowing for full visualization of the tendon. Care is taken to avoid the posteromedial neurovascular bundle by keeping the shaver against the tendon. An endoscopic suture-passing device is utilized to pierce the FHL tendon and shuttle a nonabsorbable suture through the tendon; this step is done 2 times. The tendon is then cut at its distal-most aspect (adjacent to the subtalar joint) with an endoscopic cutter. The tendon is then brought through the posteromedial portal and prepared for transosseous passage with nonabsorbable suture. Next, the anterior insertion of the Achilles tendon is endoscopically identified and debrided. With use of needle endoscopy-targeted pin placement, a Beath pin is placed at the anterior footprint of the Achilles via the posteromedial portal. The pin is advanced dorsal to plantar and out the bottom of the foot and is confirmed on fluoroscopy. With use of an appropriately sized reamer, the Beath pin is loaded with the 2 grasping sutures and shuttled plantarly. The needle endoscope is then placed in the posterolateral portal to visualize the FHL tendon, advancing into the tunnel with the foot held in 15\u00b0 of plantar flexion. An appropriately sized interference screw is then placed in the tunnel, using direct endoscopic visualization to confirm placement and depth of the screw.<h4>Alternatives</h4>Chronic Achilles tendon ruptures with symptomatic weakness often necessitate operative treatment; however, high-risk patients may be better managed nonoperatively with an ankle-foot orthosis. These patients often demonstrate improved gait and function with this orthosis<sup>1</sup>. The choice of operative technique for the treatment of chronic Achilles tendon defects is primarily based on tendon gap length; options include end-to-end repair, fascial advancement, and turn-down procedures with or without transferring the FHL, peroneus brevis, or flexor digitorum longus tendons. These techniques require substantial incisions and violation of the posterior compartments and Achilles paratenon, creating substantial postoperative scarring.<h4>Rationale</h4>Chronic Achilles tendon ruptures with defects or gaps leave the patient with weakness and biomechanical loss of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex. The gold standard algorithm in which the gap length determines the type of fascial advancement requires lengthy incisions and violation of the posterior compartments and paratenon. These reconstruction procedures do restore gastrocnemius-soleus complex tension, but also result in diminished gliding and substantial scarring and thickening. These incisions are also prone to wound complications, sural nerve injury, and painful scarring. An all-inside endoscopic FHL tendon transfer has several advantages over the standard approach. The all-inside approach prevents violation of the compartments and the Achilles, avoiding painful scars and hypertrophic tissue changes. The use of an FHL tendon transfer is advantageous as it is an in-phase transfer that maximizes neuromuscular control. The anatomic position of the flexor hallucis longus muscle also creates optimal force vectors allowing for optimal gait propulsion. The FHL also has a robust muscle belly that can hypertrophy and strengthen over time. The endoscopic approach allows for immediate weight-bearing as part of an accelerated rehabilitation, which helps to reduce muscle wasting, deep vein thrombosis, and wound complications, and facilitates an earlier return to work<sup>3</sup>.<h4>Expected outcomes</h4>This procedure provides excellent clinical outcomes with decreased complication rates, as compared with open treatment. In a study of 22 patients with chronic Achilles tendon rupture with a large tendon gap who underwent endoscopic FHL tendon transfer, the mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score improved from 55 preoperatively to 91 at the time of final follow-up<sup>4</sup>. All patients in this cohort returned to daily activities. In another study, a total of 42 patients with chronic Achilles tendon rupture underwent either endoscopic (18 patients) or open treatment (24 patients). Patients in the endoscopic cohort demonstrated better functional outcomes and decreased complication rates compared with the open treatment cohort<sup>3</sup>. Patients undergoing the endoscopic procedure also had a significant increase in American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scores postoperatively and a lower rate of complications. One patient in the open treatment cohort had a wound dehiscence. There were no wound-healing complications in the endoscopic group.<h4>Important tips</h4>Utilize a low-flow straight-forward viewing endoscope.Utilize an endoscopic suture passer to avoid iatrogenic injury.Visualize the bone tunnel prior to passing the tendon in order to confirm that the wall is intact.Plantar flex the ankle and great toe when performing the tenotomy to allow for adequate tendon length for transfer.If a low-lying FHL muscle belly is present, it can be taken back to the level of the tibial talar joint. We have found that cutting the FHL at the level of the subtalar joint is optimal for transfer.Inadequate visualization of the tendon of the subtalar joint can prevent tenotomy from being distal enough for transfer.Avoid soft-tissue bridging by minimizing utilization of the posteromedial portal and by passing a looped grasper down the suture to confirm that no soft-tissue bridges are present.Failure to utilize both endoscopy and fluoroscopy can lead to inadequate tunnel placement.<h4>Acronyms and abbreviations</h4>FHL = flexor hallucis longusHPI = history of present illnessPMH = past medical historyNSAIDs = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsPT = physical therapySH = social historyPE = physical examinationMRI = magnetic resonance imagingCAM = controlled ankle motionAOFAS = American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society.",

The aim of the study was to investigate air contamination with respiratory viruses in a dialysis unit at a quaternary hospital using molecular detection techniques and to analyze airflow dynamics through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for a comprehensive assessment of air transmission risks.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted dialysis unit air sampling using AerosolSense\u2122 samplers. Air and clinical sampling occurred during three periods in 2022: winter, early, and late fall. A technical team maintained the dialysis unit's ventilation system during mid fall. Ventilation system capacity and airflow rates were measured. CFD simulations were used to evaluate airflow dynamics.<h4>Results</h4>The investigation collected 144 air samples, revealing heterogeneous virus detection rates across locations and study periods. Virus positivity correlated with the presence of patients and the effectiveness of the ventilation system. The ratio of virus air positivity to virus patient positivity was 1.84 and 3.35 during the first and the second periods, respectively, and collapsed to 0.64 after maintenance. Airflow rate measurements highlighted a ninefold discrepancy between actual and theoretical airflow (393 m<sup>3</sup>/h <i>vs.</i> 3530 m<sup>3</sup>/h), which was rectified by maintenance actions. Airflow dynamics and particle dispersion visualization through CFD simulations contributed to a better understanding of transmission risks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Detection of viruses in the air, combined with CFD, revealed deficiencies in air renewal. Maintenance interventions significantly improved airflow dynamics and particle dispersion, reducing airborne virus spread.",

      "abstractText": "Predicting the biological behavior and time to recurrence (TTR) of high-grade diffuse gliomas (HGG) after maximum safe neurosurgical resection and combined radiation and chemotherapy plays a pivotal role in planning clinical follow-up, selecting potentially necessary second-line treatment and improving the quality of life for patients diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. The current standard-of-care (SoC) for HGG includes follow-up neuroradiological imaging to detect recurrence as early as possible and relies on several clinical, neuropathological, and radiological prognostic factors, which have limited accuracy in predicting TTR. In this study, using an in-silico analysis, we aim to improve predictive power for TTR by considering the role of (i) prognostically relevant information available through diagnostics used in the current SoC, (ii) advanced image-based information not currently part of the standard diagnostic workup, such as tumor-normal tissue interface (edge) features and quantitative data specific to biopsy positions within the tumor, and (iii) information on tumor-associated macrophages. In particular, we introduced a state-of-the-art spatio-temporal model of tumor-immune interactions, emphasizing the interplay between macrophages and glioma cells. This model serves as a synthetic reality for assessing the predictive value of various features. We generated a cohort of virtual patients based on our mathematical model. Each patient's dataset includes simulated T1Gd and Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI volumes. T1-weighted imaging highlights anatomical structures with high contrast, providing clear detail on brain morphology, whereas FLAIR suppresses fluid signals, improving the visualization of lesions near fluid-filled spaces, which is particularly helpful for identifying peritumoral edema. Additionally, we simulated results on macrophage density and proliferative activity, either in a specified part of the tumor, namely the tumor core or edge (\"localized\"), or unspecified (\"non-localized\"). To enhance the realism of our synthetic data, we imposed different levels of noise. Our findings reveal that macrophage density at the tumor edge contributed to a high predictive value of feature importance for the selected regression model. Moreover, there are lower MSE values for the \"localized\" biopsy in prediction accuracy toward recurrence post-resection compared with \"non-localized\" specimens in the noisy data. In conclusion, the results show that localized biopsies provided more information about tumor behavior, especially at the interface of tumor and normal tissue (Edge).",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background and purpose</h4>This study investigates the practicality and utility of the \"outline sign,\" which refers to the thin curvilinear hyperenhancing line that may be seen along the margin of a meningioma on a spin-echo postcontrast T1-weighted image. For cases in which the differential diagnosis may include other tumors, visualization of the outline sign may help to increase the diagnostic confidence for a meningioma. Therefore, in the temporal bone region such as the cerebellopontine angle or jugular foramen, where differential considerations may include a schwannoma or paraganglioma, we additionally investigated whether the outline sign may be observed in these nonmeningioma lesions.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A total of 39 clinical MRIs of meningiomas, schwannomas, and paragangliomas with confirmed histopathologic data were studied retrospectively. Two experienced head and neck radiologists independently assessed for the presence or absence of an outline sign and subsequently formed a consensus opinion while blinded to patient information and histopathologic data. Interreader reliability was assessed by Cohen \u03ba statistics. Simple bivariate comparisons were performed on the consensus opinions to assess for statistical differences in presence of the sign in meningiomas versus schwannomas and paragangliomas. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the sign with respect to identifying an underlying meningioma were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>Both readers displayed identical opinions in assessment of the outline sign in 34 of the 39 cases (87%), including 13 of the 14 meningiomas (93%), with substantial agreement (Cohen \u03ba of 0.74). The outline sign was present in 12 of 14 meningiomas (86%), which was significantly greater in frequency compared with schwannomas (3 of 22, 14%) and paragangliomas (1 of 3, 33%). The outline sign demonstrated high sensitivity (86%), specificity (84%), and accuracy (85%) in identifying an underlying meningioma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The outline sign can serve as a useful tool for diagnosing meningiomas. It may help distinguish meningiomas from other enhancing tumors, for example schwannomas and paragangliomas in the temporal bone region.",

      "abstractText": "The land use transition plays an important role for terrestrial environmental services, which had a mixed impact of positive and negative on the groundwater and terrestrial water resource. The health of ecological systems and groundwater depends on the mapping and management of land use. The Ganga basin is one of the most densely populated and agriculture-intensive river systems in the South Asia and the world. The multi-temporal spatial database includes land use (ESA-CCI), satellite-based gravity anomaly (GRACE/GRACE-FO), and well log (CGWB) adopted in this study for assessment of the impact of land use transition on groundwater depth, groundwater drought, and terrestrial water storage. The methodology includes the computation of land use transition, trend magnitude by Sen's slope, Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) for graphical visualization, clustering techniques employ to identify pattern & structure, and finally space-time transformation was assessed based on multi-dimensional scaling using Alternating Least Squares Scaling (ALSCAL). The land use transition over two decades shows an increase in forest (2.23%), wetland (2.2%), settlement (208.4%), bare area (3.18%), water (5.18%), and a decrease in agriculture (-1.16%), grassland (-4.5%), & vegetation (-2.8%). The non-parametric climatological trend of groundwater depth, drought, and terrestrial water loss was maximally observed during the post-monsoon season in the Ganga basin. The seasonal climatological trend statistics shows that, the upper Ganga and northern (left) of the Ganga basin shows an alarming rate of groundwater depletion, with increased in the severity of groundwater drought in near future with the loss in terrestrial water storage. The ITA shows the monotonic decreasing trend depicting loss of groundwater and terrestrial water resources. Bi-dimensional regression, ALSCAL shows that the model is efficient based on the input data having stress value and RSQ (proportion of variance) of 0.09 and 0.97 with excellent linear fit. The impact assessment of land use transition was obtained in low dimensional space showing that the conversion from sparse vegetation, agriculture, grassland, wetland and forest to settlement has the maximum impact on groundwater and TWSA loss, although the persistent settlement area is also responsible. The results are extremely useful for the policymakers, scientists, concern Govt. section, and local communities must work together to manage groundwater sustainably. Water resource management can also help to lessen the effects of climate change on groundwater and terrestrial water loss by focusing on the environmental, economic, social, and institutional dimensions of UN-SDG.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The integration of advanced technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) into surgical procedures has garnered significant attention. However, the introduction of these innovations requires thorough evaluation in the context of human-machine interaction. Despite their potential benefits, new technologies can complicate surgical tasks and increase the cognitive load on surgeons, potentially offsetting their intended advantages. It is crucial to evaluate these technologies not only for their functional improvements but also for their impact on the surgeon's workload in clinical settings. A surgical team today must increasingly navigate advanced technologies such as AR and VR, aiming to reduce surgical trauma and enhance patient safety. However, each innovation needs to be evaluated in terms of human-machine interaction. Even if an innovation appears to bring advancements to the field it is applied in, it may complicate the work and increase the surgeon's workload rather than benefiting the surgeon.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to establish a method for objectively determining the additional workload generated using AR or VR glasses in a clinical context for the first time.<h4>Methods</h4>Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded using a passive auditory oddball paradigm while 9 participants performed surgical planning for liver resection across 3 different conditions: (1) using AR glasses, (2) VR glasses, and (3) the conventional planning software on a computer.<h4>Results</h4>The electrophysiological results, that is, the potentials evoked by the auditory stimulus, were compared with the subjectively perceived stress of the participants, as determined by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire. The AR condition had the highest scores for mental demand (median 75, IQR 70-85), effort (median 55, IQR 30-65), and frustration (median 40, IQR 15-75) compared with the VR and PC conditions. The analysis of the EEG revealed a trend toward a lower amplitude of the N1 component as well as for the P3 component at the central electrodes in the AR condition, suggesting a higher workload for participants when using AR glasses. In addition, EEG components in the VR condition did not reveal any noticeable differences compared with the EEG components in the conventional planning condition. For the P1 component, the VR condition elicited significantly earlier latencies at the Fz electrode (mean 75.3 ms, SD 25.8 ms) compared with the PC condition (mean 99.4 ms, SD 28.6 ms).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results suggest a lower stress level when using VR glasses compared with AR glasses, likely due to the 3D visualization of the liver model. Additionally, the alignment between subjectively determined results and objectively determined results confirms the validity of the study design applied in this research.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Artificial sweeteners (AS) have been widely utilized in the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries for decades. While numerous publications have suggested a potential link between AS and diseases, particularly cancer, controversy still surrounds this issue. This study aims to investigate the association between AS consumption and cancer risk.<h4>Methods</h4>Targets associated with commonly used AS were screened and validated using databases such as CTD, STITCH, Super-PRED, Swiss Target Prediction, SEA, PharmMapper, and GalaxySagittarius. Cancer-related targets were sourced from GeneCards, OMIM, and TTD databases. AS-cancer targets were identified through the intersection of these datasets. A network visualization ('AS-targets-cancer') was constructed using Cytoscape 3.9.0. Protein-protein interaction analysis was conducted using the STRING database to identify significant AS-cancer targets. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID database. Core targets were identified from significant targets and genes involved in the 'Pathways in cancer' (map05200). Molecular docking and dynamics simulations were employed to verify interactions between AS and target proteins. Pan-cancer and univariate Cox regression analyses of core targets across 33 cancer types were conducted using GEPIA 2 and SangerBox, respectively. Gene chip datasets (GSE53757 for KIRC, GSE21354 for LGG, GSE42568 for BRCA, and GSE46602 for PRAD) were retrieved from the GEO database, while transcriptome and overall survival data were obtained from TCGA. Data normalization and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed on these datasets using R (version 4.3.2). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was employed to identify critical pathways in the gene expression profiles between normal and cancer groups. A cancer risk prognostic model was constructed for key targets to further elucidate their significance in cancer initiation and progression. Finally, the HPA database was utilized to investigate variations in the expression of key AS-cancer target proteins across KIRC, LGG, BRCA, PRAD, and normal tissues.<h4>Results</h4>Seven commonly used AS (Aspartame, Acesulfame, Sucralose, NHDC, Cyclamate, Neotame, and Saccharin) were selected for study. A total of 368 AS-cancer intersection targets were identified, with 48 notable AS-cancer targets, including TP53, EGFR, SRC, PIK3R1, and EP300, retrieved. GO biological process analysis indicated that these targets are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, gene expression, and cell proliferation. Thirty-five core targets were identified from the intersection of the 48 significant AS-cancer targets and genes in the 'Pathways in cancer' (map05200). KEGG enrichment analysis of these core targets revealed associations with several cancer types and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations confirmed interactions between AS and these core targets. HSP90AA1 was found to be highly expressed across the 33 cancer types, while EGF showed the opposite trend. Univariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated strong associations of core targets with KIRC, LGG, BRCA, and PRAD. DEGs of AS-cancer core targets across these four cancers were analyzed. GSEA revealed upregulated and downregulated pathways enriched in KIRC, LGG, BRCA, and PRAD. Cancer risk prognostic models were constructed to elucidate the significant roles of key targets in cancer initiation and progression. Finally, the HPA database confirmed the crucial function of these targets in KIRC, LGG, BRCA, and PRAD.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study integrated data mining, machine learning, network toxicology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and clinical sample analysis to demonstrate that AS increases the risk of kidney cancer, low-grade glioma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer through multiple targets and signaling pathways. This paper provides a valuable reference for the safety assessment and cancer risk evaluation of food additives. It urges food safety regulatory agencies to strengthen oversight and encourages the public to reduce consumption of foods and beverages containing artificial sweeteners and other additives.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type (IDH<sub>wt</sub>) glioblastomas (GB) are more aggressive and have a poorer prognosis than IDH mutant (IDH<sub>mt</sub>) tumors, emphasizing the need for accurate preoperative differentiation. However, a distinct imaging biomarker for differentiation mostly lacking. Intratumoral thrombosis has been reported as a histopathological biomarker for GB.<h4>Purpose</h4>To evaluate the fragmented intratumoral thrombosed microvasculature (FTV) signs on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for distinguishing IDH<sub>wt</sub> and IDH<sub>mt</sub> tumors.<h4>Study type</h4>Retrospective.<h4>Subjects</h4>Ninety-seven treatment-na\u00efve patients with histopathologically confirmed IDH<sub>wt</sub> GB (54 males, 26 females) and IDH<sub>mt</sub> grade 4 astrocytoma (13 males, 4 females).<h4>Field strength/sequence</h4>3-T, SWI, fluid-attenuated-inversion-recovery (FLAIR), T<sub>1</sub>-weighted, T<sub>2</sub>-weighted, PD-weighted, post-contrast T<sub>1</sub>-weighted and dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI.<h4>Assessment</h4>SWI data were evaluated by three experienced neuroradiologists (S.S., 11\u2009years; J.S., 15\u2009years; R.K.G., 40\u2009years of experience), who assessed FTV presence in necrotic and peri-necrotic regions. FTV was identified as intratumoral susceptibility signal having minimal or no interslice connections. Quantitative DCE-MRI parameters were derived using first-pass-analysis and extended Tofts model. FLAIR abnormal, contrast-enhancing, and necrotic regions were segmented using in-house developed U-Net architecture.<h4>Statistical tests</h4>Fleiss' Kappa, Cohen's Kappa, Shapiro-Wilk test, t tests or Mann-Whitney U test, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, confusion matrix. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>Fleiss' kappa test provided 91% inter-rater agreement, and Cohen's kappa provided intrarater agreement ranged from 81% to 97%. The raters' accuracy in distinguishing IDH<sub>wt</sub> from IDH<sub>mt</sub> ranged from 92% to 94%. Some of the quantitative DCE-MRI parameters (CBV, Ve, and K<sup>trans</sup>) provided statistically significant differences in differentiating IDH<sub>wt</sub> and IDH<sub>mt</sub>. K<sup>trans</sup> demonstrated 80.3% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity, with ROC analysis showing an AUC of 0.77.<h4>Data conclusion</h4>FTV signs in necrotic and peri-necrotic regions on SWI demonstrated a high accuracy in distinguishing IDH<sub>wt</sub> from IDH<sub>mt</sub>. Qualitative assessment of FTV signs showed almost perfect inter-rater and intrarater agreement. Quantitative DCE-MRI metrics also showed statistically significant differentiation of IDH<sub>wt</sub> and IDH<sub>mt</sub>.<h4>Plain language summary</h4>This study demonstrates that preoperative imaging, particularly the visualization of the fragmented thrombosed vasculature (FTV) sign on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), effectively differentiates isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type (IDH<sub>wt</sub>) glioblastoma (GB) from IDH mutant (IDH<sub>mt</sub>) grade 4 astrocytomas. Over 90% of IDH<sub>wt</sub> GB patients displayed the FTV sign, a specific imaging biomarker absent in IDH<sub>mt</sub> cases. Perfusion parameters such as cerebral blood volume, Ve, and K<sup>trans</sup> were elevated in IDH<sub>wt</sub> gliomas, reflecting distinct vascular profiles. SWI offers a noninvasive and accurate diagnostic method, overcoming limitations of histopathology. Despite limitations like unequal sample sizes and retrospective analysis, this study underscores the clinical potential of SWI in improving glioma characterization and aiding treatment planning.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.",
