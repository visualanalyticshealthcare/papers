By employing data sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection, we identified a total of 3,600 articles. Our analysis reveals a declining trend in annual publications. Active countries, institutions, journals, and authors were identified, with China, the Pasteur Network, the <i>Vaccine</i> Journal, and David B Weiner being the most prolific contributors. Keywords cluster analysis distinguished four major research directions: infectious disease and immunity, viral challenge and vaccine development, optimization of DNA vaccine delivery systems, and cancer and immunotherapy research. The literature co-citation analysis revealed four major research hotspots, including DNA vaccines for Zika virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), and COVID-19, as well as safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity studies of DNA vaccines. Concurrently, the burst citation analysis identified emerging themes, including the development of DNA vaccines for COVID-19, Ebola, and MERS-CoV, as well as innovations in antigen design and delivery technologies. This study offers valuable insights into the evolution and future directions of DNA vaccine research, emphasizing its importance for global public health and the potential to address current and future health challenges.",

Operational issues increase the risk of service failures. Improving the patient experience after service failures may lead to better outcomes for both patients and hospitals.<h4>Critical theoretical analysis</h4>Drawing support from service failure recovery and quality management paradigms, we suggest that hospitals could periodically obtain deidentified patient feedback data drawn from multiple sources-including social media-to build a comprehensive patient experience dashboard that can be used to improve health care quality.<h4>Insight/advance</h4>We offer an overarching conceptual framework to support organizational learning and make hospitals more adaptive to patient feedback. Staff members and leaders could examine patient feedback data to identify service failures and take appropriate action to prevent their recurrence in hospitals. A patient experience dashboard can be developed to document and visualize remedial actions taken by hospitals against each past service failure and shared with all stakeholders.<h4>Practice implications</h4>Reorienting health care as a service where hospitals immediately listen to patients and promptly address their questions and concerns may help to strengthen the continuity of health care services offered by hospitals as well as improve their financial position, quality of care, and the overall patient experience.",

Orthohantavirus hantanense (HTNV), the causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), represents a significant global public health concern. Here, we introduce a localized Nextstrain platform for HTNV, offering a comprehensive resource for facilitating spatiotemporal genomic surveillance and the study of evolutionary dynamics of viral genomes. Nextstrain enables web-based visualization and simple sharing of graphic and numeric data through unique web addresses. The Nextstrain build for HTNV stands out for its user-friendly interface and is readily accessible online at https://nextstrain.org/community/KU-MV/Hantavirus. This study provides valuable insights into genomic surveillance, viral phylodynamics, and the evolutionary history of orthohantaviruses for the development of public health policies against endemic HFRS outbreaks.",

      "abstractText": "Traditional in-clinic methods of collecting self-reported information are costly, time-consuming, subjective, and often limited in the quality and quantity of observation. However, smartphone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) provide complementary information to in-clinic visits by collecting real-time, frequent, and longitudinal data that are ecologically valid. While these methods are promising, they are often prone to various technical obstacles. However, despite the potential of smartphone-based EMAs, they face technical obstacles that impact adaptability, availability, and interoperability across devices and operating systems. Deficiencies in these areas can contribute to selection bias by excluding participants with unsupported devices or limited digital literacy, increase development and maintenance costs, and extend deployment timelines. Moreover, these limitations not only impede the configurability of existing solutions but also hinder their adoption for addressing diverse clinical challenges. The primary aim of this research was to develop a cross-platform EMA app that ensures a uniform user experience and core features across various operating systems. Emphasis was placed on maximizing the integration and adaptability to various study designs, all while maintaining strict adherence to security and privacy protocols. JTrack-EMA+ was designed and implemented per the FAIR (findable, accessible, interpretable, and reusable) principles in both its architecture and data management layers, thereby reducing the burden of integration for clinicians and researchers. JTrack-EMA+ was built using the Flutter framework, enabling it to run seamlessly across different platforms. This platform comprises two main components. JDash (Research Centre J\u00fclich, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Brain and Behaviour [INM-7]) is an online management tool created using Python (Python Software Foundation) with the Django (Django Software Foundation) framework. This online dashboard offers comprehensive study management tools, including assessment design, user administration, data quality control, and a reminder casting center. The JTrack-EMA+ app supports a wide range of question types, allowing flexibility in assessment design. It also has configurable assessment logic and the ability to include supplementary materials for a richer user experience. It strongly commits to security and privacy and complies with the General Data Protection Regulations to safeguard user data and ensure confidentiality. We investigated our platform in a pilot study with 480 days of follow-up to assess participants' compliance. The 6-month average compliance was 49.3%, significantly declining (P=.004) from 66.7% in the first month to 42% in the sixth month. The JTrack-EMA+ platform prioritizes platform-independent architecture, providing an easy entry point for clinical researchers to deploy EMA in their respective clinical studies. Remote and home-based assessments of EMA using this platform can provide valuable insights into patients' daily lives, particularly in a population with limited mobility or inconsistent access to health care services.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Mental health remains among the top 10 leading causes of disease burden globally, and there is a significant treatment gap due to limited resources, stigma, limited accessibility, and low perceived need for treatment. Problem Management Plus, a World Health Organization-endorsed brief psychological intervention for mental health disorders, has been shown to be effective and cost-effective in various countries globally but faces implementation challenges, such as quality control in training, supervision, and delivery. While digital technologies to foster mental health care have the potential to close treatment gaps and address the issues of quality control, their development requires context-specific, interdisciplinary, and participatory approaches to enhance impact and acceptance.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to co-produce Technology-Assisted Problem Management Plus (TA-PM+) for \"lady health workers\" (LHWs; this is the terminology used by the Lady Health Worker Programme for lay health workers) to efficiently deliver sessions to women with symptoms of common mental health disorders within the community settings of Pakistan and conducted usability testing in community settings.<h4>Methods</h4>A 3-stage framework was used for co-producing and prototyping the intervention. Stage 1 (evidence review and stakeholder consultation) included 3 focus group discussions with 32 LHWs and 7 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders working in the health system or at the health policy level. Thematic analyses using the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behavioral Change (COM-B) model were conducted. Stage 2 included over eight online workshops, and a multidisciplinary intervention development group co-produced TA-PM+. Stage 3 (prototyping) involved 2 usability testing rounds. In round 1 conducted in laboratory settings, 6 LHWs participated in role plays and completed the 15-item mHealth Usability App Questionnaire (MUAQ) (score range 0-7). In round 2 conducted in community settings, trained LHWs delivered the intervention to 6 participants screened for depression and anxiety. Data were collected using the MUAQ completed by LHWs and the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) (score range 0-46) completed by participants.<h4>Results</h4>Qualitative analysis indicated that a lack of digital skills among LHWs, high workload, resource scarcity for digitization (specifically internet bandwidth in the community), and need for comprehensive training were barriers for TA-PM+ implementation in the community through LHWs. Training, professional support, user guidance, an easy and automated interface, offline functionalities, incentives, and strong credibility among communities were perceived to enhance the capability, opportunity, and motivation of LHWs to implement TA-PM+. TA-PM+ was co-produced with features like an automated interface, a personal dashboard, guidance videos, and a connected supervisory panel. The mean MUAQ score was 5.62 in round 1 of usability testing and improved to 5.96 after incorporating LHW feedback in round 2. The mean PSQ score for TA-PM+ was 40 in round 2.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Co-production of TA-PM+ for LHWs balanced context and evidence. The 3-stage iterative development approach resulted in high usability and acceptability of TA-PM+ for LHWs and participants.",

This article aimed to present the clinical features and diagnostic workup of patients with acute and chronic peripheral nerve injuries of the head and neck using magnetic resonance neurography (MRN), to demonstrate potential advantages compared with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<h4>Methods</h4>Patients who presented with suspected peripheral nerve injury were either referred for a conventional MRI or MRN. Patients who underwent nerve exploration for suspected nerve transection and/or neuroma formation on imaging were included in this study. Imaging findings were correlated with intraoperative observations.<h4>Results</h4>Four patients (3 women, 1 man, age range: 34-70 years) were included. Three subjects had a history of head and neck surgery and 1 experienced direct trauma to the medial eyebrow. Clinical symptoms included numbness, allodynia, positive Tinel sign, and pain relief following nerve blocks. Two patients underwent conventional MRI and 2 underwent MRN. MRI provided a vague indication of potential neuromas and failed to accurately depict their locations. MRN offered a comprehensive visualization of the entire nerve path, identifying nerve transection and neuromas, as well as precise location, dimensions, and relation to adjacent bones and muscles.<h4>Conclusions</h4>High-resolution 3-dimensional MRN provides clear visualization of acute and chronic peripheral nerve injuries of the head and neck region, facilitating early diagnosis of nerve injuries in this region and improving diagnostic accuracy, as well as surgical planning and execution.",

      "abstractText": "The purpose of this work was to evaluate the image quality of a commercial CT scanner equipped with a novel detector and filtration technology called PureVision Optics (PVO). CT number, noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), modulation transfer function (MTF), and noise power spectrum (NPS) were assessed using the ACR CT Accreditation phantom scanned with various acquisitions at 80\u2009kV, 100\u2009kV, 120\u2009kV, and 135\u2009kV, each with multiple CTDIvol values of 20\u2009mGy, 40\u2009mGy, and 65\u2009mGy. Artifacts were evaluated in an anthropomorphic head phantom, a cadaver head, and in patient studies. Two neuroradiologists assessed image quality features in various patients who were examined with unenhanced brain CT on both scanners. Compared with the conventional scanner, for the same CTDIvol, the PVO scanner produced 20.3% less image noise (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 18.9% higher CNR (P\u2009<\u20090.01), and 24.6% higher spatial resolution (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Streak artifacts were less severe with the PVO scanner for the phantom, cadaver, and patient scans (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Radiologists scored the PVO scanner as significantly better for visualization of the cerebrospinal fluid space over the cerebral sulci in high convexity, image noise in gray and white matter, and artifacts in the posterior fossa. They also significantly preferred the PVO scanner for visualization of the border between brain gray and white matter, cerebrospinal fluid space around the mesencephalon, and overall diagnostic acceptability. For matched CTDIvol values, the scanner equipped with PVO technology produced better objective and subjective image quality metrics in brain CT imaging compared with a conventional CT scanner without PVO. In clinical settings, PVO may allow for lower doses while enhancing imaging through dense areas, improving visualization of subtle details, and offering more effective options for examining obese patients.This research received financial support from Canon Medical Systems USA.

      "abstractText": "<h4>Importance</h4>Pediatric peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) insertion can be difficult and time-consuming, frequently requiring multiple insertion attempts and often resulting in increased anxiety, distress, and treatment avoidance among children and their families. Ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion is a superior alternative to standard technique (palpation and visualization) in high-risk patients.<h4>Objective</h4>To compare first-time insertion success of PIVCs inserted with ultrasound guidance compared with standard technique (palpation and visualization) across all risk categories in the general pediatric hospital population.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>An open-label, pragmatic, superiority, randomized clinical trial was conducted in an Australian quaternary pediatric hospital. Children (ages 0-18 years) requiring PIVC insertion were included between July 2021 and December 2022. One catheter was studied per patient, and analysis was by intention to treat. Data analysis was performed from April to October 2023.<h4>Intervention</h4>Eligible children were randomly assigned (1:1 using computer-generated randomization and concealed allocation) to receive ultrasound-guided or standard PIVC insertion. Randomization was stratified by insertion difficulty (low, medium, or high risk) defined using a standardized tool.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The primary outcome was first-time insertion success. Secondary outcomes included number of insertion attempts, insertion failure, postinsertion complications, dwell time, patient and parent satisfaction, and health care costs.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 164 children were randomly assigned to ultrasound-guided insertion (n\u2009=\u200984) or standard care (n\u2009=\u200980), with 81 (96.4%) and 78 (97.5%) receiving their allocated intervention, respectively. The median (IQR) age was 24 (10-120) months, and 93 children (56.7%) were male. First-time insertion success was higher with ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion (72 children [85.7%]) compared with standard technique (26 children [32.5%]) (risk difference [RD], 53.6%; 95% CI, 41.7%-65.4%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Ultrasound-guided insertion led to significantly greater first-time insertion success across all risk categories, with the following RDs: low risk, 30.8% (95% CI, 8.1%-53.5%); medium risk, 56.2% (95% CI, 37.1%-75.3%); and high risk, 69.6% (95% CI, 52.3%-87.0%). Ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion had higher immediate health care costs (between group difference in total mean cost per person, A$9.33; 95% credible interval, A$8.83-A$10.86 [US $5.83; 95% credible interval, $5.52-$6.78]).<h4>Conclusion and relevance</h4>These findings suggest that ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion improves first-time insertion success across all risk categories in pediatrics, supporting the widespread adoption of ultrasound-guided PIVC insertion in children.<h4>Trial registration</h4>anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12621000206820.",

      "abstractText": "Research linking circadian dysregulation to cancer development has received increasing attention recently. However, a comprehensive understanding of research hotspots and trends in this area remains limited. International studies on the circadian rhythms in cancer were retrieved and downloaded from the Web of Science database. Bibliometric analysis and visualization were performed using VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and HistCite. Three thousand three hundred and eighteen English articles from 2004 to 2024 were screened and evaluated. The increase in publications and citations reflected the rapid expansion of the field. Scholars and institutions in the United States have relatively high academic productivity and impact. Chronobiology International is the most popular journal. Key clustering analysis identified six themes: biochemistry and molecular biology, physiology and immunomodulation, night shift work and health effects, physiological and mental health, tumor therapy research, and oxidative stress and cancer-related mechanisms. Keyword burst analysis identified the regulation of circadian rhythms on cells and tumor microenvironment as the research frontiers. The role of circadian rhythms in tumor immunotherapy was a current research hotspot identified by reference co-citation clustering analysis. This study reveals the current status of research on the circadian rhythms in cancer and predicts future trends. These findings provide new ideas for developing novel cancer prevention and treatment strategies.",

Advanced imaging techniques, particularly MR neurography and high-resolution ultrasonography (US), have significantly improved the evaluation and diagnosis of these conditions by enabling precise visualization of nerves and their surrounding anatomical structures. This review focuses on the imaging features of compressive neuropathies affecting the lumbosacral plexus and its branches, including the femoral, obturator, sciatic, common peroneal, and tibial nerves. Key conditions such as meralgia paraesthetica, piriformis syndrome, and tarsal tunnel syndrome are discussed, highlighting findings such as nerve thickening, T2 hypersignal, fascicular changes, and associated muscle denervation patterns. The ability to detect structural causes, including anatomical variations, fibrous bands, and space-occupying lesions, underscores the value of these imaging modalities in facilitating early diagnosis, guiding therapeutic interventions, and improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "To determine whether deep learning-based reconstructions of zero-echo-time (ZTE-DL) sequences enhance image quality and bone visualization in cervical spine MRI compared to traditional zero-echo-time (ZTE) techniques, and to assess the added value of ZTE-DL sequences alongside standard cervical spine MRI for comprehensive pathology evaluation. In this retrospective study, 52 patients underwent cervical spine MRI using ZTE, ZTE-DL, and T2-weighted 3D sequences on a 1.5-Tesla scanner. ZTE-DL sequences were reconstructed from raw data using the AirReconDL algorithm. Three blinded readers independently evaluated image quality, artifacts, and bone delineation on a 5-point Likert scale. Cervical structures and pathologies, including soft tissue and bone components in spinal canal and neural foraminal stenosis, were analyzed. Image quality was quantitatively assessed by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Mean image quality scores were 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 for ZTE and 3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 for ZTE-DL, with ZTE-DL exhibiting fewer artifacts and superior bone delineation. Significant differences were observed between T2-weighted and ZTE-DL sequences for evaluating intervertebral space, anterior osteophytes, spinal canal, and neural foraminal stenosis (p\u2009<\u20090.05), with ZTE-DL providing more accurate assessments. ZTE-DL also showed improved evaluation of the osseous components of neural foraminal stenosis compared to ZTE (p\u2009<\u20090.05). ZTE-DL sequences offer superior image quality and bone visualization compared to ZTE sequences and enhance standard cervical spine MRI in assessing bone involvement in spinal canal and neural foraminal stenosis. Deep learning-based reconstructions improve zero-echo-time sequences in cervical spine MRI by enhancing image quality and bone visualization. This advancement offers additional insights for assessing bone involvement in spinal canal and neural foraminal stenosis, advancing clinical radiology practice. Conventional MRI encounters challenges with osseous structures due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Zero-echo-time (ZET) sequences offer CT-like images of the C-spine but with lower quality. Deep learning reconstructions improve image quality of zero-echo-time sequences. ZTE sequences with deep learning reconstructions refine cervical spine osseous pathology assessment. These sequences aid assessment of bone involvement in spinal and foraminal stenosis.",

      "abstractText": "A medical specialty prediction system for remote diagnosis can reduce the unexpected costs incurred by first-visit patients who visit the wrong hospital department for their symptoms. To develop medical specialty prediction systems, several researchers have explored clinical predictive models using real medical text data. Medical text data include large amounts of information regarding patients, which increases the sequence length. Hence, a few studies have attempted to extract entities from the text as concise features and provide domain-specific knowledge for clinical text classification. However, it is still insufficient to inject them into the model effectively. Thus, we propose Entity-enhanced BERT (E-BERT), which utilizes the structural attributes of BERT for medical specialty prediction. E-BERT has an entity embedding layer and entity-aware attention to inject domain-specific knowledge and focus on relationships between medical-related entities within the sequences. Experimental results on clinical questionnaire data demonstrate the superiority of E-BERT over the other benchmark models, regardless of the input sequence length. Moreover, the visualization results for the effects of entity-aware attention prove that E-BERT effectively incorporate domain-specific knowledge and other information, enabling the capture of contextual information in the text. Finally, the robustness and applicability of the proposed method is explored by applying it to other Pre-trained Language Models. These effective medical specialty predictive model can provide practical information to first-visit patients, resulting in streamlining the diagnostic process and improving the quality of medical consultations.",

      "abstractText": "Exposure to anthracene can cause skin and eye irritation, respiratory issues, and potential long-term health risks, including carcinogenic effects. It is also toxic to aquatic and human life and has the potential for long-term environmental contamination. This study aims to alleviate the adverse environmental effects of anthracene through fungal degradation, focusing on bioremediation approaches using bioinformatics. Toxicity prediction using Pro-Tox 3.0 identified anthracene as a compound of toxicity class 4 with a LD50 of 316\u00a0mg/kg. Sequence of manganese peroxidase from Lachnellula suecica and human adrenergic receptor beta 2 were retrieved from NCBI databases. Secondary structure analysis using SOPMA indicated that both manganese peroxidase and adrenergic receptor beta 2 contain significant random coil content (56.57% and 51.57% respectively) followed by alpha-helix and beta-turns. The tertiary structure of both proteins was predicted using the SWISSMODEL tool and molecular docking using Autodock vina revealed strong binding affinities of anthracene with adrenergic receptor beta 2, showing a binding energy of -\u20096.6\u00a0kcal/mol with anthracene confirming the negative impacts on human health. To mitigate the anthracene pollution, further docking indicated Anthracene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid as the most vigorous ligand for manganese peroxidase of L. suecica with a binding energy of -\u20099.3\u00a0kcal/mol, suggesting its potential as a bioremediating agent. Visualization using Discovery Studio elucidated the molecular interactions within the docked complex. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OpenMM engine and AMBER force field confirmed stable enzyme-ligand complexes, highlighting the potential of manganese peroxidase for sustained enzymatic activity against anthracene.",

      "abstractText": "This study aims to establish and validate an ultrasound radiomics nomogram for preoperative prediction of central lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) before operation. A retrospective analysis conducted on ultrasonic images and clinical features derived from 288 PTMC patients, who were divided into training cohorts (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009201) and validating cohorts (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200987) in a ratio of 7:3 base on the principle of random allocation. Radiomics features were extracted from the PTMC patients after ultrasonic examination, followed by dimension reduction and characteristic selection to construct the radiomics score (Radscore) using LASSO regression analysis. Subsequently, the models, ultrasound features plus clinical features (US-Clin), radiomics score model, and combined model of clinical features plus ultrasound features and Radscore (Combined-model) were built through multi-factor logistic regression analysis. After that, the nomograms were developed for visualization and presentation of these models. The discriminative power, calibration and clinical utility of the nomogram models were evaluated in the training and validating cohorts. The Radscore model comprised 12 carefully selected features. The independent risk factors for conventional ultrasound features and clinical features of PTMC in predicting CLNM included age <45\u2009years, tumor envelope invasion, male gender and presence of microcalcifications, while the enhanced ultrasound features risk factor was extrathyroidal expansion. The combined model showed good performance in predicting PTMC CLNM, with AUCs of 0.921 and 0.889 in the training and validating cohorts, respectively. And DCA based on the prediction model showed good clinical utility. The nomogram developed based on preoperative clinical data, ultrasound features, and Radscore of PTMC patients can more accurately predict central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) in PTMC patients. However, it needs to be validated for clinical applicability in multicenter studies with larger sample sizes and combined with genomic mutation analyses of the tumors.",

      "abstractText": "Cardiovascular disease is one of the foremost causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) identified as a significant risk factor for subsequent ischemic events. Elevated LDL-C contributes to vascular injury and fibrosis by upregulating the expression of connective tissue growth factor and collagen IV, which leads to endothelial cell dysfunction that initiates the process of atherosclerotic diseases. Currently, there is an absence of clear, risk-defined criteria to identify patients who are in greater needs for intensive LDL-C reduction, particularly with PCSK9 inhibitors. The data of ischemic risk associated with different patient types are scattered across the sub-analyses of FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trials, as well as trials that analyzed the plaque morphology of high-risk patients. It would be helpful to highlight the use of clinical features and plaque morphology and identify the patient types at higher ischemic risk. This article aims to provide a clear visualization of the ischemic risk associated with various types of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and dyslipidemia, and its implications to improve risk stratification for patients with unveiling hidden dangers.",

Despite the unique promise of this technique, its successful clinical translation is limited by the low intensity emitted. We developed a systematic study of ways to increase the PpIX DF signal through acquisition sampling changes, allowing optimized imaging at video rates. To accomplish signal increase, time-gating signal compression was achieved through changes in pulse frequency and power density, using sampling rates that are faster than the decay rate of the signal. The increased signal yield was tested and validated in vitro and then demonstrated in vivo, with comparison to settings that sample the full lifetime emission decay. Results in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that optimized timing could increase the detected intensity by a factor of 7. The images showed results that were superior than when sampling the full DF lifetime decay. The proposed timing optimization enhances PpIX-based DF real-time imaging of tissue hypoxia. By increasing sampling frequency and adjusting the acquisition gate and pulse width, the collected signal intensity improved sevenfold, demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The technique was shown to enable better visualization of small and anatomically challenging hypoxic structures. The improved target-to-background ratio and compatibility with pressure-enhanced sensing of tissue oxygen technique were demonstrated.",

      "abstractText": "In metabolomic analysis based on liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, detecting and quantifying intricate objects is a massive job. Current peak picking methods still cause high rates of incorrectly picked peaks to influence the reliability and reproducibility of results. To address these challenges, we developed QuanFormer, a deep learning method based on object detection designed to accurately quantify peak signals. Our algorithm combines the feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the global computation capability of Transformer architecture. Data training in QuanFormer by using nearly 20,000 annotated regions-of-interest (ROIs) ensures unique prediction via bipartite matching, achieving 96.5% of the average precision value on the test set. Even without retraining, QuanFormer achieves over 90% accuracy in distinguishing true from false peaks. Performance was further analyzed using visualization techniques applied to the encoder and decoder layers. We also demonstrated that QuanFormer could correct retention time shifts for peak alignment and generally surpass the existing methods, including MZmine 3 and PeakDetective, to obtain a larger number of picked peaks and higher accurate quantification. Finally, we also carried out metabolomic analysis in a clinical cohort of breast cancer patients and utilized QuanFormer to detect and quantify the potential biomarkers. QuanFormer is open-source and available at https://github.com/LinShuhaiLAB/QuanFormer.",

The fourth edition of the DSM (DSM-IV, 1994) introduced the clinical significance criterion (CSC) to standardize this judgment and enhance diagnostic reliability.<h4>Methods</h4>This review conducts a theoretical and historical content analysis of CSC presence, frequency, and formulation in the diagnostic criteria of sleep disorders. Three steps were undertaken: i) selecting main sleep disorder classifications and main disorders within them, ii) systematically extracting CSC-related content, and iii) analyzing the evolution of CSC presence through quantification (Jaccard index) and visualization (radar plots).<h4>Results</h4>The fifth edition, text revision of the DSM (DSM-5-TR) includes CSC in five of nine main sleep disorders, compared to two in the third edition, text revision of the ICSD (ICSD-3-TR) (circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder and nightmare disorder). The overlap between DSM-5-TR and ICSD-3-TR is moderate (Jaccard index = 0.40). The overlap between DSM versions is higher (0.53). Conversely, ICSD revisions exhibit minimal similarity (0.16). Radar plots reveal a gradual increase in CSC use within ICSD versions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results highlight the variable application of CSC in sleep disorder classifications. Universal CSC inclusion may not be essential, but systematic discussion of its potential use can help refine diagnostic criteria. This refinement is important for accurately diagnosing sleep disorders and better differentiating the normal from the pathological, a major challenge in sleep medicine.",

Visual evaluations and paired comparative analyses of semiquantitative parameters were performed for small and reference structures. <b><i>Results:</i></b> <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake was higher in both reference and small structures for dPET compared to three different aPET scanners. The Siemens mCT20-4R (mCT20) demonstrated comparable results to dPET. Notably, mCT20 had higher standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) for the conus medullaris (CM) (3.20 vs. 2.76). CM was most highly visible with dPET on visual evaluation by physicians. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Digital PET/CT provides higher SUV values in both small and reference structures. This leads to improved visualization of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG physiological biodistribution. Given the growing adoption of dPET technology, these advancements should be carefully considered in image interpretation and clinical research.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background and aims</h4>Probe-based confocal endomicroscopy (pCLE) allows real-time microscopic visualization of the intestinal mucosa surface layers. Despite remission achieved through anti-tumor necrosis factor or vedolizumab therapy, anomalies in the intestinal epithelial barrier are observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Our study aimed to assess these abnormalities in non-IBD individuals and compare them with IBD patients in endoscopic remission to identify the associated factors.<h4>Methods</h4>The study involved 84 patients, 40 with IBD under biologic therapy for over 6\u00a0months and in endoscopic remission, and 44 without IBD or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) undergoing colorectal screening colonoscopy. White light endoscopy and probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy were performed in the ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum. Demographic, clinical, biological, and morphological factors were examined.<h4>Results</h4>pCLE revealed abnormalities in both non-IBD individuals and those with IBD in endoscopic remission, such as fluorescein leakage, blood vessel dilatation, and hypervascularization across all segments, as well as epithelial gaps in the ileum, and crypt dilatation in the colon. Comparing the two groups, IBD patients exhibited slightly more gaps in the ileum, increased fluorescein leakage in the transverse colon, and fewer vessel dilatation in the transverse colon. Abnormalities were more frequent in cases of hypertension (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), dyslipidemia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), female gender (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and family history of IBD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) or colorectal cancer (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Confocal endomicroscopy abnormalities are present in both non-IBD individuals undergoing colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy as in those with IBD in endoscopic remission. Further research is needed to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of these abnormalities and their clinical impact.",

      "abstractText": "Although the orthokeratology effects on corneal biomechanics have been proven with clinical trials, reports of stiffness parameter change are scarce. This study investigated the short-term orthokeratology effects in pediatric myopia and compared stiffness parameter changes to those published in recent clinical investigations. This prospective study aimed to investigate corneal biomechanics changes induced by short-term overnight orthokeratology treatment, focusing on stiffness parameter at A1 and stress-strain index. Twenty-six children aged 8 to 18 were included in this study using orthokeratology lenses for two different durations: 1 day and 1 week. Corneal biomechanics were assessed using corneal visualization (Corvis) Scheimpflug technology. Measurements were taken at baseline and after each wearing session. Changes in corneal stiffness parameters and corneal curvature were analyzed. All parameters changed significantly after 1 week of lens wear (p<0.05), except for velocity of corneal apex at the first and second applanation times highest concavity time, radius, stiffness parameter at A1 and stress-strain index. After 1 day, central corneal thickness, first applanation time, second applanation time, deformation amplitude ratio (2 mm), and Corvis biomechanical index (CBI) remained stable (p>0.05). After 1 week, central corneal thickness and first applanation time decreased, whereas second applanation time, deformation amplitude ratio, and Corvis Biomechanical Index significantly increased. With intraocular pressure and central corneal thickness as control variables, no significant correlation was found between stress-strain index and curvature changes (p>0.05). With age as the control variable, no significant correlation was found between stress-strain index and curvature changes (p>0.05). Short-term orthokeratology treatment induced notable changes in several corneal biomechanical parameters. Stiffness parameter at A1 and stress-strain index are unaffected by increasing lens wear duration and do not influence the orthokeratology effect.",

      "abstractText": "Low-dose CT (LDCT) screening effectively reduces lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mortality. However, accurately evaluating the malignant potential of indeterminate lung nodules remains a challenge. Carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6), a potential biomarker for distinguishing benign pulmonary nodules from LUAD, may be leveraged for noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to aid LUAD diagnosis. This study utilized mRNA, protein, and survival datasets of LUAD patients, along with an animal model of malignant pulmonary nodules, to investigate CEACAM6 expression specificity and its correlation with LUAD. Targeting ligands for CEACAM6 were designed using the Rosetta platform, labeled with [68Ga]Ga, and screened through high-throughput PET imaging to identify the optimal tracer. CEACAM6 was found to be specifically overexpressed in LUAD and was significantly associated with poor prognosis and disease progression. In vivo, [68Ga]Ga-NODA-P3 demonstrated high specificity for delineating CEACAM6-positive A549 xenografts, a LUAD model, via PET imaging, achieving a highest target-to-background ratio of 7.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44. Region of interest (ROI) analysis showed significantly higher tracer uptake in A549 xenografts compared to CEACAM6-negative Huh7 xenografts (a hepatocellular carcinoma model) at 30\u00a0min post-injection (1.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10%ID/g vs. 0.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06%ID/g). Pre-treatment with an excess of unlabeled NODA-P3 significantly reduced tumor uptake to 0.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07%ID/g. These preclinical findings indicate that [68Ga]Ga-NODA-P3 is a candidate radiotracer for the non-invasive visualization of CEACAM6-positive LUAD, demonstrating favorable imaging contrast. Although the current tumor uptake limits its immediate clinical application, ongoing optimization efforts are expected to improve its efficacy, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodules in LUAD.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Gastric cancer poses a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Improved visualization of tumor margins and lymph node metastases\u00a0with tumor-specific fluorescent markers could improve outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>To establish orthotopic models\u00a0of gastric cancer, one million cells of the human\u00a0gastric cancer cell line, MKN45, were suspended in 50 \u03bcl of equal parts PBS and Matrigel and injected into the nude mouse stomach with a 29-gauge needle. Tumors were allowed to grow for 8-12 weeks before performing imaging studies. For tumor labeling, M5A (humanized anti-CEA mAb) and IgG as a control, were conjugated with the near-infrared dye IRDye800CW. Mice were randomized to receive 50 \u03bcg of M5A-IR800 (n = 14) or 50 \u03bcg of IgG-IR800 (n = 14) intravenously and were imaged 72 hours later. Fluorescence imaging was performed using the LI-COR Pearl Imaging System.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-two lymph nodes were collected from 28 mice, of which 59.5% were found to contain metastatic gastric cancer cells on pathologic examination. In mice that received M5A-IR800, there was a statistically significant difference in the mean fluorescence signal for cancer-positive lymph\u00a0nodes at 0.431 (SE \u00b1 0.224) compared with 0.105 (SE \u00b1 0.009) for cancer-negative nodes (p: 0.002). For IgG-IR800, there was no significant difference in the mean fluorescence signal for cancer-positive nodes (0.057) compared with cancer-negative nodes (0.064), p-value 0.677.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Humanized anti-CEA (M5A) antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes provide bright labeling of lymph nodes containing metastatic gastric cancer. This tumor-specific fluorescent antibody is a promising clinical tool for identifying lymph nodes containing metastatic gastric cancer.",

      "abstractText": "To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fibrin glue in preventing early recurrence of vitreous haemorrhage following surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Single masked randomized-controlled clinical trial SUBJECTS: Consecutive patients with vitreous haemorrhage due to PDR undergoing primary vitreoretinal surgery were screened. After completing all vitreoretinal manoeuvres including endo-cautery to bleeders, infusion pressure was gradually reduced to 5 mmHg. Eyes with persistent bleeders at the macula and/or the optic nerve head not amenable to endo-cautery were included. Eyes with tractional retinal detachment more than 5-disc diameter areas and/or retinal breaks were excluded. Twenty eyes were randomized into 2 groups. Controls were treated with conventional surgery, while cases were additionally treated with fibrin glue application over the posterior bleeding sites. Vitreous haze due to early recurrent vitreous hemorrhage was graded at weeks 1 and 4 as the main efficacy outcome measure. Absence of macular membranes at 3 months was the main safety outcome measure. Mean age, frequency of pre-operative anti-VEGF injection or retinal photocoagulation, antiplatelet usage and mean intra-operative blood pressures were similar between the 2 groups. Mean surgery duration (54.6 min vs. 51.6 min) and frequency of fibrous proliferation > 2-disc diameter areas (7 each) was similar. Fine dissection with forceps and/or scissors was required in more cases than controls (6 vs. 3). Macular membranes were noted in one participant in each group. Mean grade of vitreous haze was significantly higher in controls than cases at week 1 (2.4 vs. 0.6, p=0.027) and week 4 (2 vs. 0, p=0.029). Cases had significantly better odds of having optically clear vitreous cavity at both weeks one (OR= 8.167, CI=1.02-64.03, p=0.047) and four (OR=33, CI= 1.43-760.67, p=0.029). Repeat retinal intervention for vitreous hemorrhage within 3 months was required in 5/10 controls, and in none of the cases. Our findings indicate fibrin glue application under direct visualization to be safe and efficacious in preventing recurrent vitreous hemorrhage for PDR in the early post-operative period.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop2) is overexpressed in various solid tumors and contributes to tumor progression, while its expression remains low in normal tissues. Trop2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (Trodelvy), has shown efficacy in targeting this antigen. Leveraging the enhanced specificity of ADCs, we conducted the first immunoPET imaging study of Trop2 expression in gastric cancer (GC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models using <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled Trodelvy ([<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy). This approach enables preclinical screening to identify patients who may benefit from targeted therapies.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Trop2 expression levels in GC and TNBC cell lines (NCI-N87, HGC-27, MDST8, and MDA-MB-468) were assessed via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Labeling of DFO-Trodelvy with <sup>89</sup>Zr was performed in Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> buffer at pH 7 (37\u00a0\u00b0C, 1.5\u00a0h). In vitro stability was analyzed using radio-thin layer chromatography. Biological properties were evaluated through cell uptake, saturation binding assays, and biodistribution experiments. ImmunoPET imaging with [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy was performed at various time points to confirm its in vivo targeting. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses were conducted on tumor tissues from tumor-bearing mice.<h4>Results</h4>The radiochemical yield of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy exceeded 90%, with a radiochemical purity (RCP) greater than 99%. Trop2 expression was high in MDA-MB-468 and NCI-N87 cells, while it was low in MDST8 and HGC-27 cells. The KD values of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy were 9.44\u00a0nM for MDA-MB-468 and 3.51\u00a0nM for NCI-N87 cells. ImmunoPET imaging with [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy provided clear visualization of tumor morphology in MDA-MB-468 and NCI-N87 models (n\u2009=\u20093) as early as 6\u00a0h post-injection. Tumor uptake of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy increased over time, peaking at 48\u00a0h (MDA-MB-468: 10.03\u2009\u00b1\u20091.26%ID/g; NCI-N87: 14.30\u2009\u00b1\u20092.09%ID/g), and was significantly higher than in the MDST8 (5.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.71%ID/g) and HGC-27 (4.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54%ID/g) models. Co-injection with 2\u00a0mg of unlabeled Trodelvy significantly reduced uptake in NCI-N87 and MDA-MB-468 tumors (P\u2009<\u20090.001). A high target-to-non-target ratio was observed at 48\u00a0h, showing specific tumor uptake and minimal off-target accumulation. Fluorescence imaging further confirmed higher tumor uptake in the IRDye800CW-Trodelvy group compared to the IRDye800CW-Trodelvy-blocking group (P\u2009<\u20090.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>[<sup>89</sup>Zr]Zr-DFO-Trodelvy for immunoPET imaging in TNBC and GC tumor models demonstrated specific, rapid, and sustained accumulation in tumors with high Trop2 expression, allowing for noninvasive monitoring of Trop2 status. The increased tumor-to-background ratio observed in immunoPET imaging suggests strong potential for clinical translation. Additionally, optical imaging, with its superior spatial resolution compared to PET, was employed to aid in precise probe localization and potentially enhancing differentiation between healthy and malignant tissues during surgical procedures.",
