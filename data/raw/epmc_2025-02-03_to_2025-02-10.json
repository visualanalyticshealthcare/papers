      "abstractText": "COVID-19 created an urgent element of clinical and financial strain to the public health system, forcing it into rapid response mode. Key public health decisions were quickly made, with limited data and guidance to address decision trade-offs and community inequities. Gaps identified in the pandemic confirmed the need for a new tool, like this study's Dashboard Instrument to Review Equity (DIRE) Framework, to ensure decision-makers are given quick and equitable decision-making guidance. Scoping review and tool development. The scoping review was conducted through PRISMA-ScR, and by utilizing tools like PubMed, Scopus, and Paper Piles to compile and cite. Three levels of thematic analysis were completed. Tool development consisted of building a conceptual model on the DIKW Pyramid and Informatics Stack. Then the review's five themes were integrated into DIRE. The review closed at a final count of 102 articles, with five themes emerging: COVID-19 impact, Health Equity, Decisions During Emergencies, Dashboards and Decision Support, and Frameworks. COVID-19 dashboards were also reviewed. DIRE was designed into three layers (context, data flow, and dashboard users) and three data flow buckets (data sources, DIK pillars, and interventions). This study aimed to (1) Establish a research foundation of health equity, COVID-19 lessons learned, and decision support, and (2) Develop an evidence-based framework. Though further research is still recommended, DIRE is now the first 3-point framework aimed at preparing decision-makers to respond quickly and equitably to future emergencies.",

      "abstractText": "The translation of bedside experience to pedagogical content presents a unique challenge for the field of bioethics. The contributions are multidisciplinary, the practices are heterogeneous, and the work product is characteristically nuanced. While academic bioethics education programs have proliferated, developing content and pedagogy sufficient to teach clinical ethics effectively remains a longstanding challenge. The authors identify three reasons why progress towards this goal has been slow. First, there is a lack of robust, empirical knowledge for education focused on praxis. Second, the methods employed in academic education tend to focus on traditional didactic approaches rather than engendering competency through interaction and practice-the principle means by which clinical ethicists work. Third, the data practitioners have captured has not been presented in a medium educators and students can most meaningfully interact with.In this paper, the authors describe a novel pedagogical tool: the Armstrong Clinical Ethics Coding System (ACECS) and interactive visual analytics dashboard. Together, these components comprise an educational platform that utilizes the empirical data collected by the institution's ethics service. The tool offers four advantages. First, it aids with the identification of ethical issues that present during a consultation at that specific institution or medical unit by making use of a lingua franca comprehensible to both ethicists and non-ethicists. Second, content is centered on issue frequency, type, and relation to other issues. Iterating through cases, requestors, or hospital units allows one to understand cases typologically and through metanarratives that reveal relationships and subtle patterns. Third, the use of interactive data visualizations and data storytelling aids comprehension and retention. Fourth, the process of using the system necessitates understanding the manifold ways each case can be understood, accommodating a wide range of perspectives and ethical lenses, enhancing case analysis and self-reflection conducive to life-long learning.",

      "abstractText": "Uncontrolled hypertension is a significant US health problem, despite existing effective treatments. This study assessed the impact of variations in patterns of blood pressure data on physician perceptions of hypertension control using different forms of data visualization. Physicians (N\u2009=\u200957) reviewed eight brief vignettes describing a fictitious patient; each vignette included a graph of the patient's blood pressure data. We examined how variations in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), blood pressure standard deviation (SD), and form of visualization (e.g., line graph with raw values or smoothed values only) affected judgments about hypertension control and need for medication change. Smoothing successfully reduced visual noise for the physicians. For controlled hypertension, physician judgments were more consistent with clinical guidelines when using the smoothed graph compared with the raw data graph. Judgments about hypertension control with the smoothed graph were similar to judgments made using the raw data graph for cases of uncontrolled hypertension. Data visualization can direct physicians to attend to more clinically meaningful information, thereby improving their judgments of hypertension control.",

This study details the development of a data-driven early warning system (EWS) designed to improve outbreak detection and response utilizing the data integration and visualization capabilities of Microsoft Power BI.<h4>Methods</h4>This research utilized a structured three-phase approach to design a respiratory infections (RIs) management dashboard. Phase 1, focused on identifying critical variables through literature reviews and expert interviews. In Phase 2, Microsoft Power BI was employed for dashboard development, integrating data from diverse sources. Phase 3 involved usability testing with health professionals who evaluated navigation, data accuracy, decision-support features, providing feedback to enhance visualization clarity and filtering capabilities.<h4>Results</h4>Key data categories include individual-level variables, such as age, symptoms, and vaccination records, alongside population-level metrics like infection rates and regional vaccination coverage enabling functionalities such as identifying high-risk individuals, tracking infection dynamics, and optimizing resource allocation. The dashboard, developed using Power BI visualizes epidemiological trends, intervention outcomes, and resource utilization. A relational database schema ensures efficient data retrieval, facilitating comprehensive analysis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prototype EWS represents a scalable and integrative framework aimed at enhancing public health applications, particularly in the context of respiratory infections. By incorporating data from diverse health sectors, the system offers decision-makers access to critical epidemiological indicators, supporting early outbreak detection and improved epidemic management. Its potential to unify health institutions underscores its value in fostering a more cohesive and effective approach to epidemic preparedness. Nevertheless, while the system demonstrates significant promise, further evaluation in real-world settings is essential to determine its practical impact on public health outcomes and its ability to mitigate health crises.",

The aim of oregis is to provide a comprehensive picture of the current healthcare situation and promote healthcare research using real-world-data from inpatient and outpatient facilities. Since its launch in 2020, oregis has continuously expanded its database to enable scientific analyses on a wide range of topics. This paper presents the new dashboard feature allowing participating centres to compare their own patient data with aggregated data in real time while also covering privacy aspects of the system.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The oregis steering committee opted to implement the oregis dashboard based on existing medical registries. First, forty-nine national and international registries were analysed to identify common features such as benchmarking functionality. This was followed by technical realisation and implementation.<h4>Results</h4>Each centre connected to oregis has secure access to the oregis dashboard, which displays key indicators for patients, diagnoses, and treatments. Dynamic filtering options allow targeted data analysis, comparing each centre's results anonymously with aggregated data from other centres. The dashboard uses Apache Superset data visualisation software [! etwas informativer]. Data is synchronised using an integrated oregis Konnektor module to anonymise patient data according to defined standards. Extensive security and privacy measures ensure data security, including server-side encryption, transport encryption, and two-factor authentication. The dashboard is part of a comprehensive privacy policy developed and validated for oregis by privacy experts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The number of centres connected to oregis is still growing. The new web-based dashboard allows flexible analysis of data and comparison with other centres without allowing conclusions to be drawn about any individual care centre; this ensures data privacy and independence in each centre. More features can be added to provide a more thorough overview of eye care in Germany as oregis grows.",

      "abstractText": "Leukocytes are pivotal markers in health, crucial for diagnosing diseases like malaria and viral infections. Peripheral blood smear tests provide pathologists with vital insights into various medical conditions. Manual leukocyte counting is challenging and error-prone due to their complex structure. Accurate segmentation and classification of leukocytes remain challenging, impacting both accuracy and efficiency in blood microscopic image analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a robust two-stage CNN framework that integrates YOLOv8 for precise segmentation and MobileNetV3 for effective classification. Initially, WBCs are segmented using YOLOv8m-seg, extracting ROIs for subsequent analysis. Then, features from segmented ROIs are used to train MobileNetV3, classifying WBCs into lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. This framework significantly advances leukocyte categorization, enhancing diagnostic performance and patient outcomes. The proposed technique achieved impressive accuracy rates of 99.56 %, 99.19 % and 98.89 % during segmentation and 99.28 %, 99.63 % and 98.49 % during classification on Raabin-WBC, PBC and LISC datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstractText": "Decision-making in chronic diseases guided by clinical decision support systems that use models including multiple variables based on artificial intelligence requires scientific validation in different populations to optimize the use of limited human, financial, and clinical resources in healthcare systems worldwide. This cohort study evaluated three machine learning algorithms-XGBoost, Elastic Net logistic regression, and an Artificial Neural Network-to develop a prediction model for three outcomes: mortality, hospitalization, and emergency department visits. The objective was to build a clinical decision support system for patients with noncommunicable diseases treated at the Alma Mater Hospital complex in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. We collected 4845 electronic medical record entries from 5000 patients included in the study. The median age was 71.83 years, with 63.8% women and 29.7% receiving home care. The most prevalent medical conditions were diabetes (52.9%), hypertension (67.2%), dyslipidemia (57.3%), and COPD (19.4%). For mortality prediction, the Elastic Net logistic regression model achieved an AUCROC of 0.883 (95% CI: 0.848-0.917), the XGBoost model reached an AUCROC of 0.896 (95% CI: 0.865-0.927), and the Neural Network achieved 0.886 (95% CI: 0.853-0.916). For hospitalization, the Elastic Net model had an AUCROC of 0.952 (95% CI: 0.937-0.965), the XGBoost model achieved 0.963 (95% CI: 0.952-0.974), and the Neural Network scored 0.932 (95% CI: 0.915-0.948). For emergency department visits, the AUCROC values were 0.980 (95% CI: 0.971-0.987) for Elastic Net, 0.977 (95% CI: 0.967-0.986) for XGBoost, and 0.976 (95% CI: 0.968-0.982) for the neural network. A dashboard was developed to interact with an ensemble risk categorization segmenting patient risk in the cohort to aid in clinical decision-making. A clinical decision support system based on artificial intelligence using electronic medical records possibly can help segmenting the risk in populations with Noncommunicable Diseases for effective decision-making.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Context</h4>World is aging and the prevalence of chronic diseases is raising with age, increasing financial strain on organizations but also affecting patients' quality of life until death. Research on healthcare trajectories has gained importance, as it can help anticipate patients' needs and optimize service organization. In an overburdened system, it is essential to develop automated methods based on comprehensive and reliable and already available data to model and predict healthcare trajectories and future utilization. Process mining, a family of process management and data science techniques used to derive insights from the data generated by a process, can be a solid candidate to provide a useful tool to support decision-making.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to (1) identify the healthcare baseline trajectories during the last year of life, (2) identify the differences in trajectories according to medical condition, and (3) identify adequate settings to provide a useful output.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied process mining techniques on a retrospective longitudinal cohort of 21,255 individuals who died between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2018, and were at least 66 years or older at death. We used 6 different administrative health databases (emergency visit, hospitalisation, homecare, medical consultation, death register and administrative), to model individuals' healthcare trajectories during their last year of life.<h4>Results</h4>Three main trajectories of healthcare utilization were highlighted: (i) mainly accommodating a long-term care center; (ii) services provided by local community centers in combination with a high proportion of medical consultations and acute care (emergency and hospital); and (iii) combination of consultations, emergency visits and hospitalization with no other management by local community centers or LTCs. Stratifying according to the cause of death highlighted that LTC accommodation was preponderant for individuals who died of physical and cognitive frailty. Conversely, services offered by local community centers were more prevalent among individuals who died of a terminal illness. This difference is potentially related to the access to and use of palliative care at the end-of-life, especially home palliative care implementation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite some limitations related to data and visual limitations, process mining seems to be a method that is both relevant and simple to implement. It provides a visual representation of the processes recorded in various health system databases and allows for the visualization of the different trajectories of healthcare utilization.",

      "abstractText": "The development of high-frequency ultrasound technology has transformed musculoskeletal diagnostic practices, offering detailed, multi-plane visualization of superficial structures with remarkable precision and comfort. This non-invasive, pain-free modality is particularly suited for patients of all ages, including children. Ultrasound serves as a valuable adjunct to clinical evaluations by facilitating the identification of conditions such as tumours, tenosynovitis, fractures, and nerve entrapments. Portable ultrasound devices have further expanded its utility to clinical, surgical, and emergency settings. Dynamic assessments, such as nerve gliding and entrapment detection, benefit from its precision, enabling targeted therapeutic interventions with minimal risks. The integration of ultrasound into surgical techniques, termed ultrasonosurgery, allows for minimally invasive management of conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome and other nerve compressions. By leveraging high-resolution imaging, these procedures can be performed under local anaesthesia, minimizing traditional surgical complications. This innovative approach aligns with contemporary healthcare trends emphasizing wide-awake surgeries, office-based care, mini-invasive procedures, and technological advancements. Such practices not only streamline patient care but also reduce costs and improve outcomes.",

It can alter thousands of DNA nucleotides and thus significantly influence human health, disease, and clinical phenotypes. There is a shared and growing recognition that the emergence of effective computational tools and high-throughput technologies such as short-read sequencing and long-read sequencing offers novel insight into SV and, by extension, diseases affecting planetary health. However, numerous available SV tools exist with varying strengths and weaknesses. This is currently hampering the abilities of scholars to select the optimal tools to study SVs. Here, we reviewed 175 tools developed in the past two decades for SV detection, annotation, visualization, and downstream analysis of human genomics. In this expert review, we provide a comprehensive catalog of SV-related tools across different technology platforms and summarize their features, strengths, and limitations with an eye to accelerate systems science and planetary health innovations.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Our goal of this review is to describe the current evidence and future applications of virtual reality (VR) from echocardiographic acquired images to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve the visualization of cardiac structures by providing immersive 3-dimensional (3D) environments for better interpretation, communication between healthcare providers, families and trainees.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Virtual reality is a powerful tool for education, procedural planning and simulation. Using readily available echocardiographic images for this purpose is feasible, effective and safe. This document highlights the increasing role of VR in procedural planning, education, and intraprocedural guidance using three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). Key advancements include the development of smaller 3D transthoracic and pediatric transesophageal probes with better temporal resolution, which enable enhanced imaging for preoperative planning. VR allows surgeons to visualize dynamic 3D cardiac models created from echocardiographic or Computed Tomography (CT) data, enabling better pre-surgical rehearsal, device selection, and landing zone visualization. It also provides immersive training tools for echocardiographers and offers potential for intraprocedural guidance in interventions such as atrial septal defect closures. These developments underscore the growing synergy between VR and 3DE for refining diagnosis and procedural strategies.",

In India, where diverse healthcare settings exist, trends in robotic adoption remain underexplored. This study examines the adoption patterns and geographic distribution of robotic systems for TJA in India, highlighting market dynamics over the past 5\u00a0years. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using data from manufacturers of robotic arthroplasty systems. Annual installations, tier-wise city classifications, and geographic distributions were analyzed. Statistical methods included descriptive analysis for installation trends, time-series visualization for adoption trajectories, and linear regression to forecast 2025 installations. As of September 2024, 290 robotic systems were installed across India. Among these, the CUVIS system (Meril) accounted for 89 installations (30.7%), followed by CORI (Smith and Nephew) with 66 installations (22.8%), and VELYS (DePuy) with 52 installations (17.9%). The MAKO system (Stryker) contributed 38 installations (13.1%), while MISSO (Meril) and ROSA (Zimmer) had 25 (8.6%) and 20 (6.9%) installations, respectively. Tier I hospitals dominated with 50% of installations, while Tier III and IV facilities accounted for only 10%. Linear regression predicts steady growth, with over 80 new robotic installations in 2025. Robotic technology adoption in Indian TJA has surged, with a strong preference for systems offering precision and versatility. However, barriers such as high costs and limited training impede penetration in lower tier facilities. Addressing these challenges could enhance equitable access and support the integration of robotics into diverse healthcare settings.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Future Health Today (FHT) is a program integrated with electronic medical record (EMR) systems in general practice and comprises (1) a practice dashboard to identify people at risk of, or with, chronic disease who may benefit from intervention; (2) active clinical decision support (CDS) at the point of care; and (3) quality improvement activities. One module within FHT aims to facilitate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) through the recommendation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), or statins according to Australian guidelines (defined as appropriate pharmacological therapy).<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to determine if the FHT program increases the proportion of general practice patients with CKD receiving appropriate pharmacological therapy (statins alone, ACEI or ARB alone, or both) to reduce CVD risk at 12 months postrandomization compared with active control (primary outcome).<h4>Methods</h4>General practices recruited through practice-based research networks in Victoria and Tasmania were randomly allocated 1:1 to the FHT CKD module or active control. The intervention was delivered to practices between October 4, 2021, and September 30, 2022. Data extracted from EMRs for eligible patients identified at baseline were used to evaluate the trial outcomes at the completion of the intervention period. The primary analysis used an intention-to-treat approach. The intervention effect for the primary outcome was estimated with a marginal logistic model using generalized estimating equations with robust SE.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, of the 734 eligible patients from 19 intervention practices and 715 from 21 control practices, 82 (11.2%) and 70 (9.8%), respectively, had received appropriate pharmacological therapy (statins alone, ACEI or ARB alone, or both) at 12 months postintervention to reduce CVD risk, with an estimated between-trial group difference (Diff) of 2.0% (95% CI -1.6% to 5.7%) and odds ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.81; P=.26). Of the 470 intervention patients and 425 control patients that received a recommendation for statins, 61 (13%) and 38 (9%) were prescribed statins at follow-up (Diff 4.3%, 95% CI 0 to 8.6%; odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.35; P=.04). There was no statistical evidence to support between-group differences in other secondary outcomes and general practice health care use.<h4>Conclusions</h4>FHT harnesses the data stored within EMRs to translate guidelines into practice through quality improvement activities and active clinical decision support. In this instance, it did not result in a difference in prescribing or clinical outcomes except for small changes in statin prescribing. This may relate to COVID-19-related disruptions, technical implementation challenges, and recruiting higher performing practices to the trial. A separate process evaluation will further explore factors impacting implementation and engagement with FHT.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ACTRN12620000993998; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=380119.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Systematic, multi-disciplinary review of Severe Acute Maternal Morbidity (SAMM) can improve maternal outcomes. Routinely collected data, collated into the Queensland SAMM Dashboard, may facilitate local case review. We wanted to understand how SAMMs are reviewed locally and how centrally collated data supports review processes.<h4>Aims</h4>The purpose of this survey was to assess local SAMM recording and review practices in Queensland.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A cross-sectional online survey, using multiple choice and free-text response formats, sampled multi-disciplinary health care workers (HCW) involved in SAMM review in Queensland public maternity units. Responses were analysed for content, with thematic analysis performed on free-text comments.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty HCW responded from a mix of tertiary, regional and rural maternity facilities. HCW responses identified a lack of clarity around the terms 'maternal morbidity', 'SAMM' and 'Near-Miss'. HCW reported various approaches for recording and reviewing SAMM. The commonest structures were Root Cause Analysis and Human Error and Patient Safety incident analysis. Reviews commonly involved: patient safety teams (50%); staff involved in the case (45%); independent/external reviewers (40%) and hospital management (40%). Few responses (10%) indicated consumers were involved. 30%-80% reviewed the ACSQHC defined SAMM, 70% Near-Miss cases and up to 70% reviewed other severe maternal morbidity indicators. 20% of HCW stated lessons learned during reviews were shared with other hospitals.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In Queensland, we have found variability in: HCW understanding of SAMM definitions, how cases are recorded, reviewed and improvements facilitated. A standardised approach to SAMM review and collaboration to share lessons learned may benefit maternity care.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Technological advancements have significantly reshaped health care, introducing digital solutions that enhance diagnostics and patient care. Artificial intelligence (AI) stands out, offering unprecedented capabilities in data analysis, diagnostic support, and personalized medicine. However, effectively integrating AI into health care necessitates specialized competencies among professionals, an area still in its infancy in terms of comprehensive literature and formalized training programs.<h4>Objective</h4>This systematic review aims to consolidate the essential skills and knowledge health care professionals need to integrate AI into their clinical practice effectively, according to the published literature.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a systematic review, across databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, of peer-reviewed literature that directly explored the required skills for health care professionals to integrate AI into their practice, published in English or Spanish from 2018 onward. Studies that did not refer to specific skills or training in digital health were not included, discarding those that did not directly contribute to understanding the competencies necessary to integrate AI into health care practice. Bias in the examined works was evaluated following Cochrane's domain-based recommendations.<h4>Results</h4>The initial database search yielded a total of 2457 articles. After deleting duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 37 articles were selected for full-text review. Out of these, only 7 met all the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The review identified a diverse range of skills and competencies, that we categorized into 14 key areas classified based on their frequency of appearance in the selected studies, including AI fundamentals, data analytics and management, and ethical considerations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the broadening of search criteria to capture the evolving nature of AI in health care, the review underscores a significant gap in focused studies on the required competencies. Moreover, the review highlights the critical role of regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration in facilitating the adoption of AI technologies by establishing trust and standardizing algorithms. Key areas were identified for developing competencies among health care professionals for the implementation of AI, including: AI fundamentals knowledge (more focused on assessing the accuracy, reliability, and validity of AI algorithms than on more technical abilities such as programming or mathematics), data analysis skills (including data acquisition, cleaning, visualization, management, and governance), and ethical and legal considerations. In an AI-enhanced health care landscape, the ability to humanize patient care through effective communication is paramount. This balance ensures that while AI streamlines tasks and potentially increases patient interaction time, health care professionals maintain a focus on compassionate care, thereby leveraging AI to enhance, rather than detract from, the patient experience.\u2003.",

Presently, conventional techniques for examining vaginal discharge involve the use of wet mounts and gram staining to identify vaginal diseases. In this research, we utilized fluorescent staining, which enables distinct visualization of cellular and pathogenic components, each exhibiting unique color characteristics when exposed to the same light source. We established a large, challenging multiple fluorescence leucorrhea dataset benchmark comprising 8 categories with a total of 343\u00a0K high-quality labels. We also presented a robust lightweight deep-learning network, LRNet. It includes a lightweight feature extraction network that employs Ghost modules, a feature pyramid network that incorporates deformable convolution in the neck, and a single detection head. The evaluation results indicate that this detection network surpasses conventional networks and can cut down the model parameters by up to 91.4% and floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 74%. The deep-optimal leucorrhea detection capability of LRNet significantly enhances its ability to detect various crucial indicators related to vaginal health.",

Our previous study demonstrated that the enhanced spinal synaptic transmission contributed to chronic visceral pain in irritable bowel syndrome. However, the underlying mechanism of primary sensory neuron (PSN)-derived exosomes on spinal transmission remains unclear. In this study, an exosome visualization method was established to specifically track exosomes derived from PSNs in CD63-GFPf/+ (green fluorescent protein) mice. Neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) was adopted to induce chronic visceral pain in CD63-GFPf/+ male mice. The exosome visualization technology demonstrated that NMD increased visible PSN-derived exosomes in the spinal dorsal horn, enhanced spinal synaptic transmission, and led to visceral pain in CD63-GFPf/+ male mice. The PSN-derived exosomal miR-1306-3p sorted from spinal dorsal horn activated P2X3R, enhanced spinal synaptic transmission, and led to visceral pain in NMD mice. Moreover, upregulation of Rab27a in dorsal root ganglia mediated the increased release of PSN-derived exosomes, and intrathecal injection of siR-Rab27a reduced visible PSN-derived exosomes in spinal cord, suppressed spinal synaptic transmission, and alleviated visceral pain in NMD mice. This and future studies would reveal the detailed mechanisms of PSN-derived exosomes and provide a potential target for clinical treatment of chronic visceral pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.",

      "abstractText": "<b>Background:</b> The low clinically approved doses of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) do not generate sufficient enhancement on CT for diagnostic purposes. Photon-counting detector (PCD) CT offers improved spectral resolution and could potentially enable visualization of hepatocyte-specific GBCA given their associated high gadolinium concentrations within hepatocytes. <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the potential of gadoxetate disodium in combination with PCD CT and low-keV VMI reconstructions to achieve an increase in attenuation in a phantom. <b>Methods:</b> A series of solutions was prepared of diluted gadoxetate disodium (concentrations of 0.250-2.5 \u03bcmol/ml, corresponding with doses of 25-200 \u03bcmol/kg, respectively). These solutions, along with deionized water, were evaluated in an anthropomorphic abdominal phantom using a clinical PCD-CT scanner; virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) at 40, 50, 60, and 70 keV, along with virtual noncontrast (VMC) images, were generated. Attenuation measurements were obtained; a linear regression model combined these values with previously reported in vivo data to estimate hepatic enhancement and CNR across doses. <b>Results:</b> Attenuation increased with increasing concentration at a given energy level and with decreasing energy level for a given concentration; VNC images had lowest attenuation. The maximum attenuation reached was 45.2 HU for a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcmol/ml at 40 keV. A concentration of 0.25 \u03bcmol/ml had attenuation at 40 keV of 13.0 HU. The model yielded estimated in vivo hepatic enhancement at 40 keV of 4.9 HU for a dose of 25 \u03bcmol/kg, 19.9 HU for 100 \u03bcmol/kg, and 30.8 HU for 200 \u03bcmol/kg; corresponding CNRs were 0.13, 0.52, and 0.81, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> The combination of gadoxetate disodium and PCD CT could theoretically allow appreciable hepatic enhancement at a 200-\u03bcmol/kg dose; such effect was not observed for the clinically approved 25 \u03bcmol/kg dose. <b>Clinical Impact:</b> PCD CT achieved attenuation increases for gadoxetate disodium at considerably lower doses than previously documented for CT of GBCA, albeit approximately 8-times greater than clinical doses and thus too high for clinical use. Additional research exploiting PCD-CT technology could seek to reduce further doses required for sufficient visualization into a clinically feasible range, to potentially allow CT using a liver-specific agent.",

      "abstractText": "This paper presents the Progressive Moving Average Transform (PMAT), a novel signal transformation method for converting time-domain signals into 2D representations by progressively computing Moving Averages (MAs) with varying window sizes. The approach aims to enhance signal analysis and classification, particularly in the context of heartbeat classification. Our approach integrates PMAT with a 2D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of ECG heartbeat signals. The 2D-CNN model is employed to extract meaningful features from the transformed 2D representations and classify them efficiently. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive simulations utilizing three widely-used databases: the MIT-BIH database and the INCART database, chosen to cover a wide range of heartbeats. Our experiments involved classifying more than 6 heartbeat types grouped into three main classes. Results indicate high accuracy and F1-scores, with 99.09% accuracy and 92.13% F1-score for MIT-BIH, and 98.37% accuracy and 79.37% F1-score for INCART. Notably, the method demonstrates robustness when trained on one database and tested on another, achieving accuracy rates exceeding 95% in both cases. Specifically, the method achieves 96% accuracy when trained on MIT-BIH and tested on the ST-T European database. These findings underscore the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach in accurately classifying heartbeats across different datasets, suggesting its potential for practical implementation in medical diagnostics and healthcare systems.",

Nanobodies, single-domain antibodies derived from camelids, have emerged as promising candidates for a wide range of biomedical applications due to their unique properties, including small size, high affinity, rapid clearance, and deep-tissue penetration. While effective radiolabeling techniques remain a major challenge to fully realize their clinical potential, this review aims to present recent advances in nanobody radiolabeling, focusing on radionuclides like 64Cu, 68Ga, 89Zr, and 111In, along with their associated chelators and conjugation methods. We highlight the development of innovative chelators, including p-SCN-Bn-HOPO and desferrioxamine derivatives that enhance specificity and stability, as well as advances in conjugation techniques that influence biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. These findings highlight the essential role of nanobody-based molecular imaging for precise diagnostics and targeted therapy.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>This analysis aims to understand temporal HPV vaccination coverage patterns by Health and Human Services Region (hereafter, Region) and state from 2008 to 2020.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed National Immunization Survey-Teen data (2008-2020), assessing 6 measures addressing initiation and up-to-date status by sex, as available over time. We compared, annually, Regional coverage to the national average and state-level coverage to the Regional average, identifying states and Regions as positive or negative deviants for each measure if coverage estimates diverged by at least 5 percentage points in either direction.<h4>Results</h4>Regions 1 and 9 were positive deviants and Regions 4 and 6 were negative deviants. Within deviant Regions, there were positive and negative deviant states identified, including positive deviant states within negative deviant regions (e.g. North Carolina in Region 4) and the inverse (e.g. Connecticut in Region 1).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through this novel visualization of national, Regional, and state-level HPV vaccine uptake, we unmasked patterns to support future evaluations and interventions. Future work should focus on identification and assessment of factors leading to success and opportunities for improvement for HPV vaccine promotion efforts.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>A birth interval of less than 33\u00a0months was considered short, and in low- income countries like Ethiopia, a short birth interval is the primary cause of approximately 822 maternal deaths every day. Due to that this study aimed to predict short birth interval and associated factors among women (15-49) in Ethiopia using ensemble learning algorithms.<h4>Methods</h4>A secondary data analysis of Ethiopian demographic health servey from 2016 to 2019 was performed. a total of weighted sample of 12,573 women in the reproductive age group was included in this study. Data have been extracted and processed with Stata version 17. The dataset was then imported into a Jupyter notebook for further detailed analysis and visualization. An ensemble Machin learning algorithm using different classification models were implemented. All analysis and calculation were performed using Python 3 programming language in Jupyter Notebook using imblearn, sklearn, and xgboost pakages.<h4>Results</h4>Random forest demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy 97.84%, recall of 99.70%, F1-score of 97.81%, 98.95% precision on test data and AUC (98%). Region, residency, age of women, sex of child, respondent education, distance health facility, husband education and religion were top predicting factors of short birth interval among women in Ethiopia.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Random forest was best predictive models with improved performance. \"The most significant features that contribute to the accuracy of the top-performing models, notably the Random Forest should be highlighted because they outperformed the other model in the analysis.In general, ensemble learning algorithms can accurately predict short birth interval status, making them potentially useful as decision-support tools for the pertinent stakeholders.",

However, little progress has been made to assess the risk of drug exposure during pregnancy due to ethical constraints and drug use factors. We collected and manually curated sub-pathways and pathways (sub-/pathways) and drug information to propose an analytical framework for predicting drug candidates. This framework linked sub-/pathway activity and drug response scores derived from gene transcription data and was applied to human fetal brain development and six NDDs. Further, specific and pleiotropic sub-/pathways/drugs were identified using entropy, and sex bias was analyzed in conjunction with logistic regression and random forest models. We identified 19 disorder-associated and 256 regionally pleiotropic and specific candidate drugs that targeted risk sub-/pathways in NDDs, showing temporal or spatial changes across fetal development. Moreover, 5443 differential drug-sub-/pathways exhibited sex-biased differences after filling in the gender labels. A user-friendly NDDP visualization website ( https://ndd-lab.shinyapps.io/NDDP ) was developed to allow researchers and clinicians to access and retrieve data easily. Our framework overcame data gaps and identified numerous pleiotropic and specific candidates across six disorders and fetal developmental trajectories. This could significantly contribute to drug discovery during pregnancy and can be applied to a wide range of traits.",

      "abstractText": "Optoacoustic imaging (OAI) is a unique in vivo imaging technique combining deep tissue penetration with high resolution and molecular sensitivity. OAI relying on strong intrinsic contrast, such as blood hemoglobin, already shows its value in medical diagnostics. However, OAI sensitivity to current extrinsic contrast agents is insufficient and limits its role in detecting disease-related biomarkers. The recently introduced concept of photoswitching and temporal unmixing techniques for OAI allows detecting extrinsic contrast with high sensitivity, allowing the visualization of small populations of cells labeled with photoswitching proteins deep within the tissue. However, transgene modification might not be permitted in some cases, such as for diagnostic use. Therefore, it is desirable to leverage the concept of photoswitching OAI towards injectable formulations. Since photoswitchable synthetic dyes are mainly excited by blue wavelengths unsuited for imaging in tissue, we propose exploiting the addition of XTENs to photoswitching proteins towards yielding injectable agents. The addition of XTEN to a protein enhances its plasma half-life and bioavailability, thus allowing its use, for example, in targeted labeling approaches. In this pilot study, we show that intravenously injected near-infrared absorbing photoswitchable proteins, ReBphP-PCM, coupled to XTEN, allow highly sensitive optoacoustic visualization of a tumor xenograft in vivo. The sensitivity to XTENs-ReBphP-PCM determined by ex vivo analysis of labeled cells is one to two orders of magnitude beyond conventional synthetic dyes used currently in OAI. The enhanced sensitivity afforded by photoswitching OAI, in combination with the increased bioavailability and biocompatibility of XTENs-ReBphP-PCM, makes this fusion protein a promising tool for facilitating sensitive detection of biomarkers in OAI with a potential for future use in diagnostics. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Optoacoustic imaging (OAI) is a unique in vivo imaging technique that combines deep tissue penetration with high resolution. OAI, which relies on intrinsic contrast, such as blood hemoglobin, could already be valuable in medical diagnostics. However, the use of extrinsic contrast agents to augment disease-related biomarkers in research and diagnostics suffers from very limited sensitivity of the generated contrast agent. We present an intravenously injected photoswitchable protein, ReBphP-PCM, coupled to XTEN, allowing highly sensitive OAI. The sensitivity is one to two orders of magnitude greater than that of conventional synthetic dyes used currently in OA imaging. The high sensitivity afforded by photoswitching together with the enhanced bioavailability and biocompatibility of the XTENs-ReBphP-PCM make this a standard agent for high-quality detection of OAI with potential for clinical use.",

      "abstractText": "Exploratory prospective observational cohort. Aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiologic outcome, and surgical efficiency of a novel universal delivery system that allows full-percutaneous extraforaminal, trans-Kambin lumbar interbody fusion with a large-footprint lumbar interbody cage using only fluoroscopic imaging and open-surgery instrumentation. We prospectively evaluated patients that underwent elective trans-Kambin TLIF surgery with a large-footprint interbody cage using a novel universal delivery system. Clinical follow-up was evaluated pre-and post-operatively with Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, while radiologic follow-up was performed with a computed tomography scan and standing films post-operatively at hospital discharge and 1\u00a0year follow-up. A total of 47 patients were evaluated. Clinically, post-operative VAS and ODI scores significantly (P < 0.001) improved compared to pre-operative scores and 29.4\u00a0months mean follow-up. Radiologic evaluation yielded an intervertebral fusion rate of 90% of the operated levels and a significant increase in segmental lordosis by 3.7\u00b0. Median surgical time for interbody cage insertion per level was 28\u00a0minutes. Complications included 14 (29%) cases with transitory post-operative radiculitis, 4 (8%) cases with partial muscle weakness and 2 (4%) cases that required revision surgery. Post-operative ambulation started at a median 5\u00a0hours and median hospital length of stay was 28\u00a0hours. A new universal delivery system allows overcoming most limitations of current full-endoscopic trans-Kambin fusion as it allows a time- efficient full-percutaneous insertion of a large-footprint interbody cage under fluoroscopy imaging only, with standard open-surgery instruments and optional endoscopic visualization.",

A 9-year-old entire male West Highland White Terrier. The dog was referred for further investigation of recurrent collapsing episodes and weakness. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a pancreatic mass. Biochemical tests were consistent with insulinoma. A dynamic (4D) contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) perfusion study showed a large pancreatic mass originating from the left lobe of the pancreas invading both the portal and splenic veins directly. The portal vein was 80% occluded between the gastroduodenal and splenic vein entry points. The dog underwent partial pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and portal venotomy. Following identification of the thrombus by direct visualization and palpation, Rummel tourniquets were used to isolate the segment of the portal vein, and portal venotomy was performed over the thrombus. The venotomy was repaired with primary closure. Intraoperative hemorrhage was absent following the release of the vascular isolation. Histopathology was consistent with insulinoma. The dog was discharged 4\u2009days after surgery. Short-term follow up revealed an absence of postoperative complications. The dog was started on adjuvant therapy, and the re-examination 3\u2009months after surgery showed an absence of the clinical signs and a good quality of life. One year after surgery, the dog is still alive with confirmed metastatic disease. Portal venotomy was successful for thrombus removal and this dog tolerated temporary occlusion of the portal vein well. Careful preoperative CT planning is crucial for good surgical outcomes.",

The study was undertaken in the Bhubaneswar Smart City, Odisha, India, from July to December 2023. Fecal samples were collected at 2 points for DNA analysis, ie, on day 0 and day 60 of the change from a meat/egg-based diet to a vegetable-based diet. Extracted DNA samples were pooled category-wise and subjected to the gut microbiome analysis in the Nanopore sequencer targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Burrows-Wheeler Transform, Ferragina-Manzini index, and Krona charts were used for taxonomical classification and visualization of relative abundances of bacterial species within the metagenome. Alpha- and beta-diversity analyses were performed. Atopic pets at day 0 showed elevation in the gut microbiome population with an adequate concentration of pathogens like Escherichia coli and Clostridiodes difficile with lower amounts of the beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus sp, while the pets at 60 days after dietary intervention showed a significant decline in bacterial species like E coli and C difficile with higher amount of Lactobacillus sp. Both control groups showed variations of microbiome between them as well as from the atopic pets. We found a close association of poultry meat/egg diet with gut microbiome population and atopic symptoms as well in dogs, and elimination of such diet could be helpful in clinical recovery. Dietary intervention with the exclusion of potential allergens from poultry meat and egg sources can be an effective approach for the management of canine atopic dermatitis.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The digital landscape has become a vital platform for public health discourse, particularly concerning important topics like organ donation. With a global rise in organ transplant needs, fostering public understanding and positive attitudes toward organ donation is critical. Social media platforms, such as X, contain conversations from the public, and key stakeholders maintain an active presence on the platform.<h4>Objective</h4>The goal is to develop insights into organ donation discussions on a popular social media platform (X) and understand the context in which users discussed organ donation advocacy. We investigate the influence of prominent profiles on X and meta-level accounts, including those seeking health information. We use credibility theory to explore the construction and impact of credibility within social media contexts in organ donation discussions.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were retrieved from X between October 2023 and May 2024, covering a 7-month period. The study was able to retrieve a dataset with 20,124 unique users and 33,830 posts. The posts were analyzed using social network analysis and qualitative thematic analysis. NodeXL Pro was used to retrieve and analyze the data, and a network visualization was created by drawing upon the Clauset-Newman-Moore cluster algorithm and the Harel-Koren Fast Multiscale layout algorithm.<h4>Results</h4>This analysis reveals an \"elite tier\" shaping the conversation, with themes reflecting existing societal sensitivities around organ donation. We demonstrate how prominent social media profiles act as information intermediaries, navigating the tension between open dialogue and negative perceptions. We use our findings, social credibility theory, and review of existing literature to develop the OrgReach Social Media Marketing Strategy for Organ Donation Awareness. The OrgReach strategy developed is based on 5 C's (Create, Connect, Collaborate, Correct, and Curate), 2 A's (Access and Analyse), and 3 R's (Recognize, Respond, and Reevaluate).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study highlights the crucial role of analyzing social media data by drawing upon social networks and topic analysis to understand influence and network communication patterns. By doing so, the study proposes the OrgReach strategy that can feed into the marketing strategies for organ donation outreach and awareness.",

A challenge of ductoscopy is an adequate treatment of intraductal lesions by complete removal to prevent exploratory duct excision surgery. This study aimed to determine the in vivo feasibility of intraductal laser ablation during ductoscopy to remove intraductal lesions in patients suffering from pathological nipple discharge (PND).<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective, single-center diagnostic feasibility trial was conducted between October 2022 and November 2023, enrolling adult women with unilateral PND and no radiological suspicion of malignancy. Intraductal laser ablation was performed after incomplete intraductal biopsy using a Thulium laser.<h4>Results</h4>Duct cannulation and subsequent ductoscopic exploration were successful in 21 patients revealing an intraductal lesion in 13 patients (61.9%). From these 13 patients, 9 patients (69.2%) underwent intraductal laser ablation due to a residual lesion after biopsy. Pathology of the removed intraductal lesions showed a papilloma in eight (88.9%) patients and a papilloma/DCIS combination in one patient (11.1%). Post-procedure, PND stopped in 77.8% of the patients (7/9). Two patients had recurrent PND complaints caused by a residual lesion.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Intraductal laser ablation during ductoscopy in patients with papillary lesions seems to be feasible and safe. The Thulium laser enables ablation of residual lesions and is therefore suitable for an immediate second intervention after ductoscopic removal of intraductal lesions. Further refinement and validation in a follow-up clinical trial are necessary to further assess its therapeutic efficacy.",

Patients with oral cancer undergoing microvascular reconstruction were categorized into two cohorts based on the intraoperative use of the 3D 4K exoscope (Orbeye\u2122, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) or a conventional microscope (ZEISS S8 - OPMI Vario, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany; Leica M680, Leica Mikrosysteme Vertrieb GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) during a six-month study period, respectively. Outcomes were also compared between two time periods of the exoscope use to assess the learning curve over time.<h4>Results</h4>The exoscope was applied for microvascular anastomosis in 55 surgical cases (cohort 1), and the conventional microscope was employed in 56 cases (cohort 2). The rates of postoperative complications within 14 days following the use of the exoscope were 14.5% (N\u2009=\u20098), compared to 16.1% (N\u2009=\u20099) in cohort 2. Analysis over time demonstrated a learning curve with the exoscope, reflected in a decrease in postoperative complications within 14 days from 22.7 to 9.1%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The three-dimensional camera system provides excellent and reliable intraoperative visualization in reconstructive head and neck surgery. Transitioning to this new technology did not lead to an increase in intra- or postoperative complications, but the successful implementation requires some experience with the device.",

      "abstractText": "Multiclass data sets and large-scale studies are increasingly common in omics sciences, drug discovery, and clinical research due to advancements in analytical platforms. Efficiently handling these data sets and discerning subtle differences across multiple classes remains a significant challenge. In metabolomics, two-class orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models are widely used due to their strong discrimination capabilities and ability to provide interpretable information on class differences. However, these models face challenges in multiclass settings. A common solution is to transform the multiclass comparison into multiple two-class comparisons, which, while more effective than a global multiclass OPLS-DA model, unfortunately results in a manual, time-consuming model-building process with complicated interpretation. Here, we introduce an extension of OPLS-DA for data-driven multiclass classification: orthogonal partial least squares-hierarchical discriminant analysis (OPLS-HDA). OPLS-HDA integrates hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) with the OPLS-DA framework to create a decision tree, addressing multiclass classification challenges and providing intuitive visualization of interclass relationships. To avoid overfitting and ensure reliable predictions, we use cross-validation during model building. Benchmark results show that OPLS-HDA performs competitively across diverse data sets compared to eight established methods. This method represents a significant advancement, offering a powerful tool to dissect complex multiclass data sets. With its versatility, interpretability, and ease of use, OPLS-HDA is an efficient approach to multiclass data analysis applicable across various fields.",

      "abstractText": "Transplant rejection remains a significant barrier to the long-term success of organ transplantation. Biopsy, although considered the gold standard, is invasive, costly, and unsuitable for routine monitoring. Traditional biomarkers, such as creatinine and troponin, offer limited predictive value owing to their low specificity, and conventional imaging techniques often fail to detect early organ damage, increasing the risk of undiagnosed rejection episodes. Considering these limitations, emerging noninvasive biomarkers and molecular imaging techniques hold promise for the early and accurate detection of transplant rejection, enabling personalized management strategies. This review highlights noninvasive biomarkers that predict, diagnose, and assess transplant prognosis by reflecting graft injury, inflammation, and immune responses. For example, donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is highly sensitive in detecting early graft injury, whereas gene expression profiling effectively excludes moderate-to-severe acute rejection (AR). Additionally, microRNA (miRNA) profiling enhances the diagnostic specificity for precise AR detection. Advanced molecular imaging techniques further augment the monitoring of rejection. Fluorescence imaging provides a high spatiotemporal resolution for AR grading, ultrasound offers real-time and portable monitoring, and magnetic resonance delivers high tissue contrast for anatomical assessments. Nuclear imaging modalities such as single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography, enable dynamic visualization of immune responses within transplanted organs. Notably, dd-cfDNA and nuclear medicine imaging have already been integrated into clinical practice, thereby demonstrating the translational potential of these techniques. Unlike previous reviews, this work uniquely synthesizes advancements in both noninvasive biomarkers and molecular imaging, emphasizing their complementary strengths. Biomarkers deliver molecular-level insights, whereas imaging provides spatial and temporal resolution. Together, they create a synergistic framework for comprehensive and precise transplant monitoring. By bridging these domains, this review underscores their individual contributions and collective potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve patient outcomes, and guide future research and clinical applications in transplant medicine.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Tumour vascular density assessed from CD-31 immunohistochemistry (IHC) images has previously been shown to have prognostic value in breast cancer. Current methods to measure vascular density, however, are time-consuming, suffer from high inter-observer variability and are limited in describing the complex tumour vasculature morphometry.<h4>Methods</h4>We propose a method for automatically measuring a range of vascular parameters from CD-31 IHC images, which together provide a detailed description of the vasculature morphology. We first used a U-Net based convolutional neural network, trained and validated using 36 partially annotated whole slide images from 27 patients, to segment vessel structures and tumour regions from which the measurements are taken. The model also segments the vascular smooth muscle, benign epithelium, adipose tissue, stroma, lymphocyte clusters, nerves and CD-31 positive leukocytes, and we applied it to an additional 21 images from 15 patients. Using these segmentations, we investigated the relationship between the various tissue types and the vasculature and studied the relationship of various vascular parameters with clinical parameters. We also performed a 3D histology analysis on a separate tumour sample as a proof of principle, providing a more comprehensive visualization of vasculature morphology compared to the standard 2D cross-section of a tissue sample.<h4>Results</h4>Using two-way cross-validation, we show that vessels were accurately segmented, with Dice scores of 0.875 and 0.856, and were accurately identified, with F1 scores of 0.777 and 0.748. All vascular parameters exhibit strong ( r>0.7 ) and significant (p<0.001) correlations with measurements taken from the manual ground truth vessel segmentations. A significant relationship between the major/minor axis ratio, a measure of elongation, and the tumour grade was found.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our proposed method shows promise as a tool for studying the tumour vasculature and its relationship with surrounding cells and tissue types. Furthermore, the correlation with tumour grade highlights the clinical relevance of our approach. These findings suggest that our method could have substantial implications for improving prognostic assessments and personalizing therapeutic strategies in breast cancer treatment.",

      "abstractText": "Septic arthritis is a severe disease that damages articular cartilage and triggers a strong inflammatory response. Current treatments mainly depend on systemic antibiotics and lack effective intra-articular therapies, as well as standardized animal models, and precise detection methods. In this study, we present a drug delivery system responsive to the bacterial microenvironment for targeted inflammation control, along with an effective method for monitoring changes in septic arthritis in SD rats. This system consists a core with pH-sensitive metal-organic frameworks ZIF-8 loading anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and a shell with hybrid cell membranes from macrophages (MM) and platelets (PM), refer as MP@ZIF-8@IN. This system, which diverges from traditional treatments, enhances drug utilization, prolongs local retention, and allows for spontaneous release at the treatment site, thereby enabling the exclusive intra-articular treatment of septic arthritis. The drug delivery system inhibits the NF-\u03baB pathway, reduces oxidative stress, and regulates macrophage polarization, preventing cartilage destruction. Additionally, in this standardized animal model utilizing the knee joints of SD rats, we have developed musculoskeletal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging for time-based monitoring, thus overcoming the limitation of conventional methods, which are unsuitable for soft tissue analysis. Our findings advance therapeutic strategies for septic arthritis and encourage further application of visualization techniques in related fields. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study presents significant advancements in the treatment and understanding of septic arthritis. Our customized drug delivery system targets bacteria and macrophages, ensuring long-time drug retention and enhanced inflammation control, all while reducing reliance on antibiotics-an important step toward addressing antibiotic resistance. Additionally, we have refined septic arthritis animal models to establish clearer guidelines for intervention timing, grounded in clinical symptoms and imaging data. This addresses a critical gap in current research and offers a practical framework for future therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction and importance</h4>A single coronary artery (SCA) is a rare congenital anomaly in which the artery originates from either the left or right coronary sinus. Shortly after its origin, the SCA branches into the right coronary artery (RCA), the left anterior descending artery (LAD), and the left circumflex artery (LCx). When the SCA originates from the right coronary sinus, the LAD may follow one of several abnormal courses, including the posterior atrioventricular groove, retro-aortic, interarterial, intraseptal, prepulmonic, or posterior-anterior interventricular groove. Assessing the anatomical risk and the presence of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) in the anomalous vessel is essential for determining the appropriate treatment.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We present a very rare case of a retro-aortic LAD course originating from SCA of the right coronary sinus in a patient admitted to our clinic for evaluation of chest pain. Coronary angiography (CA) of the right coronary system revealed a SCA. RCA was occluded, with chronic total occlusion (CTO). Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was done to specify the course of LAD, which showed a SCA and a posterior course around the aorta of LAD.<h4>Clinical discussion</h4>CA is a valuable tool to identify and classify coronary artery anomalies (CAAs), but due to invasiveness, low spatial resolution, and lack of three-dimensional images, it has been progressively replaced by CCTA. CCTA is the gold standard for diagnosis of the CAAs that enabling three-dimensional visualization of the surrounding cardiac and non-cardiac structures identify patients with malignant CAAs. Taking into account the presence of SCA and CTO, the treatment option is recanalization of CTO or cardiac surgery if refractory angina is present.<h4>Conclusion</h4>When the SCA originates from the right coronary sinus, identifying the abnormal course of the LAD is critical, as it may be life-threatening. Alongside CA, CCTA plays a key role in evaluating the anatomy and associated risks of this anomaly. The appropriate treatment is determined based on the presence and severity of concomitant CAD.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Older adults are more likely to have multiple chronic conditions, be prescribed multiple medications, and be more susceptible to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to their medications. In addition, older adults often use over-the-counter medications and supplements, further complicating their medication regimens. Complex medication regimens are potentially harmful to older adults. Interventions aimed at reducing medication discrepancy in the ambulatory clinic setting, such as reviews of medication lists and the implementation of \"brown bag\" reconciliation, continue to be challenging, with limited success. Pharmacist-led interventions to improve appropriate medication use in older adults have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing ADRs. Video visits have the potential to provide direct visualization of medications in older adults' homes, thereby reducing medication discrepancy and increasing medication adherence. Pharmacist-led management of older adults' medication regimens may improve appropriate medication use in older adults.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study is to examine the effect of pharmacist-led medication through home televisits compared to usual care on appropriate medication use, medication discrepancies, medication adherence, and ADRs.<h4>Methods</h4>We will conduct a 2-site cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). The intervention will be a pharmacist-led home televisit including medication reconciliation and assessment of actual medication use. The cluster RCT was iteratively adapted after a pilot test. The primary outcome of medication appropriateness of the intervention will be measured using the STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions) criteria for potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) at 6 months. Medication lists obtained will be compared against electronic medical records (EMRs) by a clinician to establish discrepancies in medications. The clinician will review medications using the validated Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI).<h4>Results</h4>This project has been peer-reviewed and selected for support by the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Services Research Service. The pilot phase of the study was completed December 2021 with 20 veterans and was primarily informed by the Steinman model of the prescribing process adapted to include system- and provider-level factors. The last date of enrollment was August 6, 2021. We anticipate the completion of the ongoing trial in spring 2025. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2025.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The cluster RCT will provide evidence on medication management through televisits. If found effective in improving the use of medications, the intervention has the potential to impact older adults with multiple chronic conditions and polypharmacy.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04340570; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04340570.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>PRR1-10.2196/65141.",

      "abstractText": "ConspectusBiomarkers play a vital role in the regulation of life processes, especially in predicting the occurrence and development of diseases. For the early diagnosis and precise treatment of diseases, it has become necessary and significant to detect biomarkers with sensitivity, accuracy, simplicity, convenience, and even visualization. Fluorescent-probe-based techniques have been recognized as one of the most powerful tools for the sensitive detection and real time imaging of biomarkers in biological samples. However, traditional optical probes, mainly including the visible probes (400-700 nm) and the near-infrared I (NIR-I, 700-900 nm) probes, suffer from low sensitivity, poor resolution, strong absorption and scattering, and high background fluorescence, which hinder effective monitoring of biomarkers.Fortunately, the past decade has witnessed a remarkable evolution in the application fields of near-infrared II (NIR-II, 900-1700 nm) fluorescence, driven by its exceptional optical characteristics and the advancement of imaging technologies. Leveraging the superior penetration capabilities, negligible autofluorescence, and extended fluorescence emission wavelengths, NIR-II fluorescent probes significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of <i>in vitro</i> detection (IVD) and the temporal resolution of <i>in vivo</i> imaging. Our team has been committed to the design strategy, controlled synthesis, luminous mechanisms, and biomedical applications of NIR-II fluorescent probes. In this Account, we present the representative works in recent years from our group in the field of NIR-II fluorescent probes for analytical applications, ranging from <i>in vitro</i> detection of biomarkers to <i>in vivo</i> imaging monitoring of different biomarkers and various diseases, which also will further provide a general overview of analytical applications of NIR-II fluorescence probes. First, the <i>in vitro</i> analytical applications of NIR-II fluorescent probes are fully summarized, including tumor marker detection, virus and bacteria analysis, cell testing, and small-molecule sensing. Second, the <i>in vivo</i> imaging monitoring applications of NIR-II fluorescent probes are adequately discussed, including ROS detection, gas monitoring, pH sensing, small-molecule testing, receptor analysis, and the imaging diagnosis of some serious diseases. Finally, we further outline the application advantages of NIR-II fluorescent probes in analytical fields and also discuss in detail some challenges as well as their future development. There is a reasonable prospect that the <i>in vitro</i> detection technology and the <i>in vivo</i> imaging monitoring technology based on NIR-II fluorescent probes will exhibit great development potential in biomedical research and clinical disease diagnosis. We hope that this Account can expand their reach into an even broader spectrum of fields, further enhancing their impact on scientific discovery and medical practice.",
