      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic was a critical time for public health, and though dashboards remained a source of critical health information for decision-makers, key gaps in equity-based decision support were revealed. The DIRE (Dashboard Instrument to Review Equity) Framework and Checklist tool was developed to be a practical tool for public health departments to use in evaluating equity-based decision support mechanisms in their dashboards.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this agreement and reliability study was to validate the DIRE Checklist tool as a practical and reliable instrument for data practitioners to use in evaluating dashboards.<h4>Methods</h4>This study was divided into 5 steps to conduct the necessary analysis for agreement and reliability. Step 1 completed the development of the DIRE Checklist tool in Qualtrics (Qualtrics International Inc). Step 2 focused on the parameters required for the selection of the 26 US state-based dashboards. Step 3 was the user testing and assessment process during which each reviewer applied the DIRE tool to each dashboard. Step 4 involved conducting different assessment methods to specifically calculate the comparative analysis, interrater agreement, intraclass correlation coefficients, and the cosine similarity for the Qualtrics, reviewer, and categorical scores. Finally, Step 5 involved conducting any qualitative assessment required on the notes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 26 dashboards were evaluated using the DIRE Checklist tool by 2 reviewers. The overall percentage comparison for the Qualtrics Score was 31.7% (28.24/89) for Reviewer 1 and 41.8% (37.16/89) for Reviewer 2, resulting in a relative percent agreement of 72.7%. Additionally, the categorical scores showed substantial to high agreement across most categories based on percent agreement within each category. The intraclass correlation coefficient scores indicated varying levels of agreement across different categories, with good agreement observed for the Qualtrics score.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reliability and agreement result of the study confirmed strong performance of the DIRE checklist tool. The scores calculated were evaluated consistently and reliably by both raters-demonstrating the DIRE Checklist tool's ability to robustly evaluate different dashboards across a number of different categories and parameters.",

However, current protocols yield relatively low success rates of about 20% per treatment cycle. A critical but complex and time-consuming step is the grading and selection of embryos for implantation. Although incubators with time-lapse microscopy have enabled computational analysis of embryo development, existing automated approaches either require extensive manual annotations or use opaque deep learning models that are hard for clinicians to validate and trust. We present EmbryoProfiler, a visual analytics system collaboratively developed with embryologists, biologists, and machine learning researchers to support clinicians in visually assessing embryo viability from time-lapse microscopy imagery. Our system incorporates a deep learning pipeline that automatically annotates microscopy images and extracts clinically interpretable features relevant for embryo grading. Our contributions include: (1) a semi-automatic, visualization-based workflow that guides clinicians through fertilization assessment, developmental timing evaluation, morphological inspection, and comparative analysis of embryos; (2) innovative interactive visualizations, such as cell-shape plots, designed to facilitate efficient analysis of morphological and developmental characteristics; and (3) an integrated, explainable machine learning classifier offering transparent, clinically-informed embryo viability scoring to predict live birth outcomes. Quantitative evaluation of our classifier and qualitative case studies conducted with practitioners demonstrate that EmbryoProfiler enables clinicians to make better-informed embryo selection decisions, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes in IVF treatments.",

Visual analytics combines computational techniques with interactive visualizations, enabling the identification of patterns, anomalies, and attribute interactions. However, existing approaches frequently overlook the interplay between temporal and multivariate attributes. We introduce EventBox, a novel data representation and visual encoding approach for analyzing groups of events and their multivariate attributes. We have integrated EventBox into Sequen-C, a visual analytics system for the analysis of event sequences. To enable the agile creation of EventBoxes in Sequen-C, we have added user-driven transformations, including alignment, sorting, substitution and aggregation. To enhance analytical depth, we incorporate automatically generated statistical analyses, providing additional insight into the significance of attribute interactions. We evaluated our approach involving 21 participants (3 domain experts, 18 novice data analysts). We used the ICE-T framework to assess visualization value, user performance metrics completing a series of tasks, and interactive sessions with domain experts. We also present three case studies with real-world healthcare data demonstrating how EventBox and its integration into Sequen-C reveal meaningful patterns, anomalies, and insights. These results demonstrate that our work advances visual analytics by providing a flexible solution for exploring temporal and multivariate attributes in event sequences.",

One of these technologies is an opioid panel dashboard, which lists patient-level information and related opioid safety measures. This paper describes our experiences of implementing dashboards in 2 different settings and how clinicians used those dashboards and their associated attitudes and perceptions.<h4>Methods</h4>Two primary care programs, a single-site academic residency program [Highland Family Medicine (HFM)] and a multisite regional network [Primary Care Network (PCN)], incorporated opioid safety dashboards, differing in content and implementation strategies. We surveyed clinicians within the 2 programs in 2023 to understand how they used these dashboards and their associated attitudes and perceptions.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 49 eligible clinicians responded to the survey. A total of 31% of HFM clinicians and 81% of PCN clinicians found the dashboard useful. Approximately half of HFM clinicians felt badly if they had patients above 90 MMEs. Almost all clinicians reported using the dashboard to make clinical decisions, most commonly prescribing intranasal naloxone. In addition, PCN clinicians reported tapering or stopping opioid or benzodiazepine prescriptions based on the dashboard data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Dashboards can be an important tool to support safe opioid prescribing, but attention needs to be given to how clinicians view and interact with the dashboards. This is critical to ensure that the information presented in dashboards is both actionable and not misinterpreted.",

      "abstractText": "With less than two years remaining from 2027-the year which the government has targeted to achieve zero Indigenous cases, we map the malaria indicators across the 700\u2009+\u2009districts for five years between 2019 and 2023 using spatiotemporal maps and also assess the potential drivers of malaria transmission in different regions. We used the annual district-wise malaria data from the National Center for Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NCVBDC) and the cross-sectional socio-economic data from the National Family Health Survey. We also collated the meteorological and land-use land-cover data from the MERRA-2 and Sentinel-LPA satellites, respectively. We then developed region-specific ensembles of spatiotemporal models that allowed us to identify the associated covariates while the regions were identified using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistics. With 0.33\u00a0million malaria cases in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in reported cases. The P. falciparum affected regions are widespread in North-eastern and Central India. However, after the pandemic, an emerging geographical expansion into the north-eastern parts is observed for the P. vivax, which is evident from the clusters and the spatiotemporal ensemble models. Population belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and those economically marginalised are among the most vulnerable, but lifestyle habits such as drinking water practices, maternal education, and healthcare accessibility are associated with malaria transmission. We also developed a digital dashboard that allows the general public and the stakeholders to track the malaria indicators for each district and the corresponding year.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Osteoporosis and subsequent fractures not only seriously threaten the health of the aging but also escalate healthcare costs and social burdens. Undoubtedly, it is necessary to constantly optimize the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporotic fractures, and further understanding and investigation of the related studies is indispensable. However, the research on osteoporotic fractures is difficult to summarize, with complicated content and multiple disciplines involved. Consequently, this bibliometric analysis was conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding and grasp the hot topic of osteoporosis worldwide, which is beneficial to precisely guide research trends and demonstrate emerging treatments and preventive strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>The literature published between January 2014 and October 2024 was systematically searched in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Visualization software, including Vosviewer and CiteSpace, was used to conduct the analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 6682 publications were obtained from 2014 to 2024 for bibliometric analysis. The USA is far ahead of other countries in both the number of publications and frequency of citations, with extensive co-authorship collaborations with nearly all other countries. Cyrus Cooper is the most influential author, and the University of Sheffield is the most influential organization in the related fields. The keywords are categorized as 6 clusters, including \"hip fracture,\" \"bone turnover,\" \"denosumab,\" \"atypical femoral fracture,\" \"vitamin D,\" and \"bone strength\". The ongoing hotspots include \"teriparatide,\" \"hip,\" \"fragility fractures,\" and \"outcome\".<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study comprehensively summarizes the topic trends and developments in the field of osteoporotic fractures using bibliometric analysis over the past decade. The hotspots and frontiers mainly focused on the prediction of osteoporosis and fractures, drug treatment, and clinical management. The intersection of multiple disciplines and various emerging frontiers has provided great potential for the management of osteoporotic fractures. Further investigation and more clinical translation are necessary.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>To systematically map the research landscape of synthetic data in healthcare between 2000 and 2024, revealing prevalent topics and tracking their evolution over time and across geographic locations.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied structural topic modeling (STM) to map this landscape, identifying prevalent topics and their evolution over time and geography. PubMed articles from 2000 to 2024 with \"synthetic data,\" \"artificial data,\" or \"simulated data\" in the title/abstract were analyzed. Texts were preprocessed (lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming), and STM was run with year and continent as covariates. The optimal number of topics (K\u2009=\u200910) was selected based on held-out likelihood and interpretability. Topic trends and correlations were analyzed using stacked area charts and network analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Among 7533 articles, a 20-fold growth in publications was observed. North America (48.1%) and Europe (31.8%) dominated early research, while Asia's share rose from 4.7% to 24.1%. Topics grouped into four themes: Biomedical Imaging & Signal Processing (21.1%), Synthetic Data Applications (20.7%), Computational & Statistical Methods (34.3%), and Genomics & Molecular Biology (23.9%). Initially prominent topics such as \"Bayesian Modeling\" (23.1%-10.8%) and \"Statistical Bias & Missing Data\" (21.9%-7.1%) declined, while \"Synthetic Data Generation\" (2.7%-23.0%), and \"Disease Modeling and Public Health\" (3.5%-14.3%) grew significantly.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Synthetic data research in healthcare is expanding, with shifting regional contributions and evolving topic focus. Realizing its potential requires cross-disciplinary collaboration, bias mitigation, and equitable partnerships.",

      "abstractText": "The visualization and analysis of street and pedestrian networks are important to various domain experts, including urban planners, climate researchers, and health experts. This has led to the development of new techniques for street and pedestrian network visualization, expanding possibilities for effective data presentation and interpretation. Despite their increasing adoption, there is no established design framework to guide the creation of these visualizations while addressing the diverse requirements of various domains. When exploring a feature of interest, domain experts often need to transform, integrate, and visualize a combination of thematic data (e.g., demographic, socioeconomic, pollution) and physical data (e.g., zip codes, street networks), often spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales. This not only complicates the process of visual data exploration and system implementation for developers but also creates significant entry barriers for experts who lack a background in programming. With this in mind, in this paper, we reviewed 45 studies utilizing street-overlaid visualizations to understand how they are applied in practice. Through qualitative coding of these visualizations, we analyzed three key aspects of street and pedestrian network visualization usage: their analytical purposes, the visualization approaches employed, and the data sources used in their creation. Building on this design space, we introduce StreetWeave, a declarative grammar for designing custom visualizations of multivariate spatial network data across multiple resolutions. We demonstrate how StreetWeave can be used to create various street-overlaid visualizations, enabling effective exploration and analysis of spatial data. StreetWeave is available at urbantk.org/streetweave.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>In blended care, digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) integrate with face-to-face psychotherapy provided in person or via telehealth. To incorporate DMHIs into routine care for depression and anxiety, it is important to understand the needs and expectations of mental health professionals for blended DMHIs.<h4>Objective</h4>The study objective was to partner with Australian mental health professionals in the design of a transdiagnostic, cognitive behavioral therapy-based blended model of care for adults experiencing depression and anxiety.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants were Australian health professionals who treat adults with depression and anxiety. The participatory design process included a web-based survey (N=258), one-on-one interviews (N=14), and a 2-part focus group (N=6). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through the web-based survey. In-depth qualitative feedback from interviews and the 2-part focus group was subjected to reflexive thematic analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Mental health professionals found blended care with face-to-face therapy more acceptable than telehealth and blended care with telehealth, with standalone DMHIs being the least preferred option. The most common ways in which mental health professionals thought a DMHI could integrate with face-to-face psychotherapy included homework completion (129/178, 72.5%), skills practice to support in-session therapy (128/178, 71.9%), and psychoeducation (127/178, 71.3%). Mental health professionals expect the blended DMHI to be easy to use, flexible, protective of client data, and to include evidence-based content from several therapeutic modalities (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness). Other preferences included mental health professionals being able to prescribe specific program modules to their clients, track the treatment progress of clients, and receive alerts if their clients' symptoms worsened. In terms of implementation, mental health professionals were concerned about the time and effort needed to use blended care. They suggested that ongoing training and support would help mental health professionals implement blended care with their clients. Monitoring client risk and progress via a web-based dashboard and downloadable summaries was also important.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Designing DMHIs that support psychotherapy for adults with depression and anxiety has the potential to increase access to evidence-based treatment. Involving mental health professionals in DMHI design is expected to increase their acceptance of DMHIs and facilitate the integration of these digital products into routine care.",

      "abstractText": "The US neurosurgical workforce faces growing demand driven by an aging population and rising prevalence of neurological conditions. This study projects workforce supply and demand from 2022 to 2037, highlighting potential shortages and geographic disparities. Workforce projections (2022-2037) were obtained from the Health Resources & Services Administration's National Center for Health Workforce Analysis Dashboard, using the Health Workforce Simulation Model to estimate supply and demand by specialty, year, and location. Supply, measured in full-time equivalents (FTEs), accounted for new entrants, retirements, and attrition. Demand was projected under two scenarios: 1) status quo and 2) reduced barriers, reflecting improved access for underserved populations. Workforce adequacy (supply-to-demand ratio) was assessed, with descriptive statistics and state-level heat maps generated using Excel and Python in Google Colab. The neurosurgery workforce is projected to grow slightly from 7060 FTEs in 2022 to 7230 FTEs by 2037 (+2.4%). Under the status quo scenario, demand rises from 7060 to 8310 FTEs (+18%), while the reduced barriers scenario shows an increase from 9280 to 11,830 FTEs (+27%). Workforce adequacy decreases across both scenarios, with national adequacy dropping from 100% to 87% under the status quo and from 72% to 61% under reduced barriers. Metropolitan areas maintain higher adequacy compared with nonmetropolitan areas but still face shortages over time. State-level disparities persist through 2037, with adequacy ranging from 400% in the District of Columbia to 33% in Delaware. By then, neurosurgery ranks 18th under the status quo and 33rd under reduced barriers among 37 specialties. Significant neurosurgical workforce shortages are projected through 2037, with growing demand outpacing modest supply increases, particularly under the reduced barriers scenario. Targeted strategies are needed to address geographic disparities and ensure adequate neurosurgical care nationwide.",

This study aims to explore the knowledge framework and key research areas in this domain, using bibliometric methods to analyze trends, collaboration patterns, and essential themes related to children's mental health at high altitudes.<h4>Methods</h4>A bibliometric analysis was conducted on publications from 1979 to 2024 retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The R package \"Bibliometrix,\" VOSviewer, and CiteSpace were used to analyze publication trends, collaboration patterns, and research themes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 520 English-language articles were included. The United States was the most prolific country (226 articles), and Duke University was the leading institution (66 articles). The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry was the most influential journal. E. Jane Costello was the most prolific author (50 publications). Co-occurrence network analysis identified four major clusters: possible mechanisms, outcomes, psychopathology, and management of mental health issues. Academic research in very high HDI countries focuses more on quality-of-life and mental health issues, whereas low and medium HDI countries prioritize fundamental public health and common disease prevention.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides a bibliometric foundation for quantitatively assessing research trends on mental health among children in high-altitude regions. Current research primarily focuses on underlying mechanisms, outcomes, mental health conditions, and management strategies. For countries at different development levels, research should be tailored to their specific social development stages and health challenges.",

      "abstractText": "The rapid expansion of scientific literature has made it increasingly challenging for clinicians and researchers to efficiently identify relevant evidence. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for automating literature review tasks, few tools support integrated workflows that enable trend analysis as well. This study aimed to develop and evaluate Rapid Clinical Evidence eXplorer (RaCE-X), a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-based automated pipeline designed to streamline abstract screening, extract structured information, and visualize key trends in clinical research. We used GPT-4.1 mini to screen 865 PubMed abstracts based on predefined screening criteria. Structured information was then extracted from the 87 relevant abstracts based on a predefined information model covering nine fields. A gold standard data set was created through expert review to assess model performance. The extracted information was visualized through an interactive dashboard. Usability was evaluated using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) and open-ended feedback from five clinical research coordinators. RaCE-X demonstrated high screening performance (precision = 0.954, recall = 0.988, F1 = 0.971) and achieved strong average performance in information extraction (precision = 0.977, recall = 0.989, F1 = 0.983), with no hallucinations identified. Usability testing indicated generally positive feedback (overall PSSUQ score = 2.8), with users noting that RaCE-X was intuitive and effective for data interpretation. RaCE-X enables efficient GPT-based abstract screening, structured information extraction, and research trend exploration, thereby facilitating the summary of clinically relevant evidence from the biomedical literature. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs to reduce manual workload and accelerate evidence-based research practices.",

This is particularly important for those at higher health risks and their care providers, allowing for better risk interpretation which may lead to more informed decisions. However, the kinds of visualizations used to represent data may impart biases that influence data interpretation and decision making. Both continuous representations using bar charts and discrete representations using icon arrays are pervasive in health risk communication, but express the same quantities using fundamentally different visual paradigms. We conducted a series of studies to investigate how bar charts, icon arrays, and their layout (juxtaposed, explicit encoding, explicit encoding plus juxtaposition) affect the perception of value comparison and subsequent decision-making in health risk communication. Our results suggest that icon arrays and explicit encoding combined with juxtaposition can optimize for both accurate difference estimation and perceptual biases in decision making. We also found misalignment between estimation accuracy and decision making, as well as between low and high literacy groups, emphasizing the importance of tailoring visualization approaches to specific audiences and evaluating visualizations beyond perceptual accuracy alone. This research contributes empirically-grounded design recommendations to improve comparison in health risk communication and support more informed decision-making across domains.",

This study aims to develop a domain-specific, self-supervised MEG clinical foundation model tailored for headache disorders to address the challenges of high-dimensional data and limited labeled datasets in clinical research.<h4>Approach</h4>We developed a transformer-based model pretrained on a large-scale dataset comprising multi-state MEG recordings (resting-state, auditory, and somatosensory stimulation) from 416 participants (362 headache patients and 54 healthy controls). The model utilized a self-supervised masked-signal reconstruction strategy to learn latent spatiotemporal representations of neural activity. We evaluated the model's performance through signal reconstruction, visualization of attention weights, and downstream classification tasks comparing model-derived features against original MEG signals for migraine diagnosis.<h4>Main results</h4>The pretrained model successfully reconstructed both continuous MEG signals and stimulus-specific evoked responses, effectively capturing intrinsic spatiotemporal brain dynamics. Visualization of the model's attention weights demonstrated spatial alignment with corresponding sensory brain regions, confirming its neurophysiological interpretability. Furthermore, classifiers trained on features extracted from the pretrained model significantly outperformed those using original MEG signals in identifying migraine patients, revealing distinct neural response patterns.<h4>Significance</h4>This study introduces a scalable, data-efficient framework for clinical MEG analysis that significantly reduces reliance on manual feature extraction and labeled data. It demonstrates the efficacy of foundation models in decoding complex neural dynamics, offering promising implications for understanding neuropathology and facilitating precision diagnostics in neurology.",

It occurs more frequently in tropical and subtropical regions with inadequate sanitation, particularly among individuals in close contact with livestock. Patients often present with severe ocular irritation, including foreign body sensation, redness, pain, and increased lacrimation; severe cases may develop complications such as keratitis or intraocular involvement. Diagnosis primarily relies on the direct visualization of larvae under slit-lamp microscopy. The cornerstone of treatment involves the mechanical removal of larvae under topical anesthesia, supplemented by local application of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents. This review systematically summarizes current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, clinical features, and management advances, with the aim of enhancing clinical recognition and therapeutic outcomes.",

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential but remains challenging due to overlapping clinical presentations and limited sensitivity of conventional tools. Advances in nuclear medicine imaging now enable in vivo visualization of key pathological processes, including amyloid-\u03b2 and tau deposition, \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, dopaminergic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and altered cerebral metabolism. Recent progress in quantitation frameworks, multimodal integration with fluid biomarkers, and AI-assisted applications is further enhancing reproducibility and clinical translation. In this review, we summarize advances in radiotracer development, clinical applications, and standardization efforts, highlight insights from Taiwan on the integration of molecular imaging into differential diagnostic workflows for dementia and Parkinsonian syndromes, and outline remaining challenges and future directions toward precision medicine in neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Quality improvement programs are essential to enhance surgical patient safety and outcomes. However, reliance on administrative data for benchmarking can introduce errors and lack relevant details. We incorporated surgeon-specific data and a group-based strategy for inpatient operations to improve mortality, length of stay (LOS), and readmissions at a tertiary care center with an open surgeon staffing model.<h4>Methods</h4>A dashboard, created using Vizient (Irving, TX) data, included LOS index, mortality index, and procedure-related readmissions with outcomes tracking at individual surgeon-level. Group outcomes data were updated monthly. Individual reports were provided quarterly to surgeons, and designated leaders developed quality improvement programs per surgery type. Practice-specific group data (thoracic, surgical oncology, acute care surgery, bariatric surgery, general surgery, two colorectal surgery units, and minimally invasive surgery) were presented monthly, and leaders shared program implementation details annually or semiannually. Differences over time were calculated via t-test. Improvement strategies were also tracked.<h4>Results</h4>Over three years (2021-2023), 33 surgeons conducted 8145 inpatient operations. Quality improvement strategies included refined surgical patient candidate selection, proactive involvement of palliative care for high-risk patients, adoption of standard clinical pathways (enhanced recovery after surgery), more robotic surgery, and documentation improvement. Mortality rate decreased from 0.64 to 0.17 (P = 0.003); LOS index reduced from 0.97 to 0.92 (P = 0.03). Procedure-related readmissions were stable.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Surgeon-specific group-based strategies may help increase adoption of surgical protocols and techniques to improve surgical outcomes. This program highlights the importance of collaborative and data-driven strategies for enhancing patient care quality.",

In our clinical practice, we encountered a patient with secondary IFI because of an osteochondroma in the lesser trochanter region, presenting with typical posterior hip pain. Traditional surgical methods typically involve lesion resection through a posterolateral approach to the hip, with only a few patients reported using hip arthroscopy. We present a modified posterior hip arthroscopic technique for resecting an osteochondroma near the lesser trochanter. This technique allows for rapid access to the lesion site and provides clear visualization of the sciatic nerve under arthroscopy, facilitating safe and thorough lesion resection.Level of evidence V, Case Study.",

      "abstractText": "Cancer centers and health systems are tasked with deciding where to deploy community interventions to reduce the burden of cancer within their catchment areas. Few methods exist to prioritize communities in a systematic manner, considering features of individuals, populations, systems, and policies. We developed a geographically informed index to prioritize census tracts based on community need, with an initial focus on identifying communities in need of breast cancer screening (BCS) interventions. This study used publicly available data to select variables known to be associated with disparities in BCS rates. Variables were identified from five categories: economic stability, education access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context, and health status and health care access and quality. Data were analyzed at the census tract level across the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center catchment (N = 1,216). Principal component analysis was applied to 23 variables, and five principal components were selected to construct a composite measure using a weighted sum. The resulting index values were used to stratify the data set for further analysis and mapped for visualization. The analysis produced the Community Need Priority Index (CNPI)-BCS, with values ranging from 0 to 1 (mean, 0.259; standard deviation [SD], 0.161). The top quintile (Q5, n = 243) represented the highest-need communities. Q5 tracts were primarily concentrated in Philadelphia, Camden, and Delaware counties. Philadelphia County had the highest average (mean, 0.364; SD, 1.78) and the most tracts in the top quintile (45%, n = 175). Montgomery county had the lowest average (mean, 0.169; SD, 0.092). This novel methodological approach considered the complex nature of multiple, intersectional barriers to good health to identify priority areas of need within cancer center catchment areas.",

      "abstractText": "Histology is a foundational discipline in medical education that connects basic biomedical sciences with clinical practice. However, its perceived relevance may diminish as students progress academically, especially when integration with clinical teaching is limited. This study aimed to assess medical students' perceptions of histology's value, teaching quality, and clinical integration at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University across different academic levels. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in January 2025 among 235 undergraduate medical students. A validated, self-administered questionnaire measured students' perceptions of histology's importance, teaching effectiveness, clinical relevance, curricular integration, and overall satisfaction. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, logistic regression, and Pearson correlation. Most students rated histology as important or very important (73.6%) and acknowledged its contribution to understanding disease mechanisms (88.5%). Satisfaction was strongly associated with perceived applicability, visualization, and integration. Lectures and laboratory sessions were rated as effective or very effective by 75.7% and 76.2% of students, respectively. Additionally, 80.9% supported stronger clinical integration, and 83% preferred the inclusion of clinical examples. Perceptions varied across academic stages, with preclinical students expressing more favorable views. Regression analysis identified teaching quality and integration with clinical content as significant predictors of positive perceptions. Histology continues to be a valued component of medical education when delivered through effective teaching and clinically relevant integration. Strengthening instructional design and embedding clinical context throughout the curriculum may enhance student engagement, improve learning outcomes, and sustain the relevance of histology across all stages of medical training.",

      "abstractText": "This study aimed to develop a fully automated survival prediction (FASP) system that analyzes whole-liver regions from preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) after curative resection in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FASP comprised three consecutive components: automatic liver and tumor segmentation models, and a RFS prediction model, LiverSurv, all based on deep convolutional neural networks. FASP was compared against a clinical model leveraging clinical factors and three tumor-based methods using semantic, radiomic, or deep learning features. A total of 827 patients were included across the development, internal test, and external test sets. In the internal and external test sets, FASP achieved concordance indices (C-indices) of 0.646 (95% CI: 0.566, 0.725) and 0.786 (95% CI: 0.726, 0.846), respectively, outperforming the clinical model (both adjusted P<.05). Integrating clinical factors improved C-indices to 0.664 (95% CI: 0.591, 0.736) internally and 0.800 (95% CI: 0.750, 0.849) externally. FASP also surpassed the tumor-based models, which yielded C-indices ranging from 0.623 to 0.632 internally and 0.523 to 0.775 externally. Visualization analysis demonstrated that FASP captured prognostic information from both tumor and background liver regions. These findings suggest whole-liver-based deep learning provides a promising non-invasive approach to predict recurrence risk for HCC patients before surgery.",

Existing software for molecule selection lacks features to select molecule panels from large data sets, requires programming experience, or lacks user-friendly interfaces. We present the Omics Molecule Extractor (OMEx), an open-source web application providing a user-friendly workflow for selecting molecules and molecule panels for sample classification from large data sets. OMEx's user interface provides interactive visualization for exploring input data and analysis results. The feature selection strategy underlying the algorithm is based on machine learning and has not been available in any software with a user interface. Extensive testing using synthetic data sets with known ground truth showed that the algorithm discovers group-separating molecules with high precision. Additionally, OMEx was tested on five real-world omics data sets, demonstrating high reproducibility and overlap with reported molecules from other feature selection methods, while also reporting alternative molecules of interest. OMEx is freely available at https://mdoa-tools.bi.denbi.de/omex/home.",

      "abstractText": "Spatially resolved isotope tracing provides a powerful means for achieving deeper and more accurate characterization of metabolic activities in biological tissues. However, its application in mammals remains limited by several key technical challenges, including complex surgical procedures, the need for high tracer doses, and poor suitability by clinical tissue samples. In this study, we developed a novel spatially resolved isotope tracing method by integrating ex vivo tissue labeling with airflow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI). Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we identified 263 labeled metabolites in ex vivo U-<sup>13</sup>C glucose-labeled rat kidney tissue, including amino acids, nucleotides, organic acids, and lipids. Moreover, AFADESI-MSI enabled the in situ characterization of 27 labeled metabolites. This method allowed the simultaneous visualization of complex metabolic networks and their spatially dynamic activities without the need for in vivo tracer injection. Our results revealed that the kidney cortex exhibited significantly higher glucose uptake efficiency and gluconeogenic activity compared with the medulla, whereas the medulla demonstrated greater activity in reducing pyruvate to lactate. We anticipate that this method will provide new strategies and analytical tools for investigating metabolic heterogeneity in clinical tumors and other complex tissues.",

Both techniques are complementary in their diagnostic potential and enable an individualized clinical care, including diagnostic confirmation, prognosis estimation and treatment planning. The use of CCT enables a\u00a0precise visualization of the coronary vessels, including the detection and quantification of luminal stenosis and additional plaque characterization. It is particularly suitable for the noninvasive clarification of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with a\u00a0low to moderate pretest probability and for procedural planning in cardiology. The high negative predictive value of CCT enables its use as a\u00a0gatekeeper for unnecessary invasive diagnostics of CAD. The use of CMRI provides a\u00a0combination of functional morphological diagnostics with a precise myocardial tissue characterization, which are helpful for the assessment of CAD, inflammatory heart diseases and cardiomyopathies. Due to the possibility to quantify myocardial damage, CMRI has a high prognostic value. The combination of both non-invasive techniques in the present-day modern cardiac diagnostics is essential for guideline-compliant and patient-centered care by the coverage of the broad spectrum of cardiac diseases and the supplementary methods.",

      "abstractText": "Host-microbial metabolic interactions have been recognized as an essential factor in host health and disease. Genome-scale metabolic modeling approaches have made important contributions to our understanding of the interactions in such communities. One particular such modeling approach is BacArena, in which metabolic models grow, reproduce, and interact as independent agents in a spatiotemporal metabolic environment. Here, we present a modeling application of BacArena, a virtual colonic environment, which reveals spatiotemporal metabolic interactions in a computational colonic environment. This environment resembles the crypt space together with the mucus layers, the lumen, and fluid dynamics. Our proof-of-principle experiments include mono-colonization simulations of context-specific colonic cells and simulations of context-specific colonic cells with the SIHUMIx minimal model microbiome. Our simulations propose host-microbial and microbial-microbial interactions that can be verified based on the literature. Most importantly, the Virtual Colon offers visualization of interactions through time and space, adding another dimension to the genome-scale metabolic modeling approaches. Lastly, like BacArena, it is freely available and can be easily adapted to model other spatially structured environments (http://www.github.com/maringos/VirtualColon).IMPORTANCEInteractions between the human body and gut microbes are crucial for health and disease. We present the Virtual Colon, an extension of the individual-based microbiome modeling approach BacArena that mimics key features of the colon, including the crypts, mucus layers, lumen, and fluid flow. Using this model, we simulate gut environments including host cells with bacterial species alone and with a simplified gut microbiota (SIHUMIx). These simulations reveal patterns of host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions that align with known findings. A key strength of the Virtual Colon is its ability to show how interactions unfold over time and space, offering new insights beyond traditional modeling approaches. The Virtual Colon is freely available and can be adapted to other structured biological environments (http://www.github.com/maringos/VirtualColon).",

Metastatic prostate cancer is the concern and the lower survival rate, if not detected. Nuclear medicine has played a pivotal role in prostate metastasis detection and treatment for many decades. The emergence of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted PET radiopharmaceuticals has significantly advanced the imaging of prostate cancer. Among these, <sup>18</sup>F-flotufolastat, commercially known as Posluma, represents a pivotal development in the detection and management of PSMA-positive lesions. Its favorable pharmacokinetics-including low urinary excretion and minimal bladder activity-enhance lesion detectability in the pelvic region, a common challenge in prostate imaging. Clinical trials such as LIGHTHOUSE and SPOTLIGHT demonstrated <sup>18</sup>F-flotufolastat's high specificity, diagnostic accuracy, and safety profile across diverse patient populations. With a cyclotron-produced <sup>18</sup>F isotope and a 110-min half-life, <sup>18</sup>F-flotufolastat offers logistical advantages for imaging centers and flexibility in scan timing. As a PSMA-based agent, <sup>18</sup>F-flotufolastat enables precise visualization of prostate cancer cells and metastatic sites, positioning it as a valuable tool in the evolving landscape of nuclear medicine and prostate cancer care.",

      "abstractText": "Endodontic microsurgery (EMS) is an important treatment option for endodontic disease when the nonsurgical endodontic treatment fails. However, EMS for maxillary molars often presents a clinical challenge due to the root apex close to the maxillary sinus floor, which may increase the risk of sinus membrane perforation. Furthermore, the depth between the apex of the palatal root and the buccal cortical plate significantly impacts EMS precision for restricting visualization and instrument access. This case report is the first to use an autonomous robotic (ATR) system for minimally invasive EMS on a maxillary first molar, combined with precise lateral wall sinus fenestration. A 55-year-old male patient presented with symptomatic apical periodontitis associated with previously treated left maxillary first molar. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) revealed low-density areas surrounding the mesiobuccal (MB) and palatal (P) roots, and maxillary sinus floor descended between the palatal and buccal roots. Integrating CBCT and intraoral scan data, the ATR system performed guided sinus fenestration localization, autonomous osteotomy, and a 15-mm root-end resection from buccal to palatal root, with real-time monitoring of depth, angulation, and force. The clinician employed endoscopic assistance to verify the integrity of the sinus membrane and ensure the removal of debris from the surgical site. Root-end preparation and filling were carried out under a microscope. Follow-ups at one week, one month, three months, and six months indicated an absence of clinical symptoms. This approach offers a precise and minimally invasive treatment option for molars with a descended maxillary sinus floor located between the buccal and palatal root.",

Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale for back and leg pain and the Oswestry Disability Index. Radiographic parameters, including vertebral slip, disc height, and foraminal height, were evaluated on standing lateral x-ray images, while fusion status was assessed using Bridwell grading on 6-month postoperative computed tomography scans.<h4>Results</h4>At a mean follow-up of 11.7 \u00b1 2.6 months, all patients demonstrated statistically significant clinical improvement, visual analog scale scores decreased from 7.2 \u00b1 0.6 to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 for low back pain, from 7.5 \u00b1 0.5 to 1.7 \u00b1 0.6 for leg pain, and the Oswestry Disability Index improved from 42.6 \u00b1 5.7 to 15.7 \u00b1 2.5 (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Radiologically, vertebral slip was reduced from 11.3 \u00b1 1.5 mm to 2.1 \u00b1 0.4 mm. Anterior and posterior disc heights increased from 5.6 \u00b1 0.6 mm and 4.9 \u00b1 0.5 mm to 8.5 \u00b1 1.2 mm and 8.3 \u00b1 1.4 mm, respectively. Foraminal height improved from 9.8 \u00b1 1.7 mm to 14.7 \u00b1 2.8 mm. Fusion was confirmed in all cases (Bridwell grade I: 28.6%, grade II: 71.4%), with no cage subsidence or major complications reported.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of the 30-degree endoscope in BE-LIF for spondylolisthesis with severe disc collapse provides enhanced visualization, facilitates safe and effective decompression, and results in favorable clinical and radiological outcomes.<h4>Level of evidence: 3</h4>",

      "abstractText": "Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Extensive multi-omics analyses have revealed significant intratumoral heterogeneity even within the same histopathological subtype. However, a database that systematically integrates multi-omics data for lung cancer research has long been lacking. Here, we developed LOSTdb, a molecular subtype annotation system for lung cancer that integrates multi-omics data and metadata. LOSTdb comprises 295 multi-omics datasets, including bulk RNA-seq, genomic, proteomic, methylation, and scRNA-seq data, with over 10,000 manually curated metadata entries. This resource encompasses high-quality clinical specimens, mouse models, and cell lines, totaling 34,393 samples and more than 1.2\u00a0million single cells. Each omics sample was annotated with both literature-based classical subtypes and NMF-derived meta-program (MP) subtypes. The platform supports cross-searching of omics and metadata at the gene and dataset levels, offers multiple visualization and analysis methods, and includes five tool modules, enabling functions such as integrated analysis, significance analysis between metadata as well as between genes and metadata, and target prediction for lung cancer molecular subtypes, serving as an essential tool for lung cancer precision medicine. LOSTdb is a user-friendly interactive database freely accessible at http://lostdbcancer.com:8080 .",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>We compared ultrahigh-resolution (UHR) photon-counting detector-computed tomography (PCD-CT) and spectral post-processed images for coronary stent visualization in a dynamic, anthropomorphic, and circulatory phantom.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Ten coronary stents were scanned at 60, 80, and 100\u2009beats per min (bpm) using UHR-spectral PCD-CT (96\u2009\u00d7\u20090.2\u2009mm collimation). Reconstructions included UHR (0.2\u2009mm), downsampled (0.6\u2009mm), and spectral\u00a0post-processed images (0.4\u2009mm), including virtual monoenergetic images (VMI; 45-100\u2009keV), lumen-preserving images, and iodine maps (IM). Objective quality was assessed by measurable\u00a0stent lumen visibility and stent\u00a0strut width overestimation\u00a0factor,\u00a0compared\u00a0to nominal strut width. Subjective quality was rated using a 4-point Likert scale. Repeated-measures analysis of variance-ANOVA and Friedman test with post hoc corrections were applied.<h4>Results</h4>UHR images provided the highest lumen visibility (62.6\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6%) at 60 bpm, outperforming all reconstructions ranging 43.5-52.7% (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) except IM (59.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.9%, pairwise\u00a0p\u2009=\u20090.839). UHR showed the lowest strut overestimation factor\u00a0(18.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4), better than\u00a0all spectral images (20.2-26.2, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.003) and DS (32.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Subjective quality was best for UHR at 60 bpm (4.0 [interquartile range, IQR 4.0-4.0]) but declined at 100 bpm (3.0 [IQR 2.0-3.0], p\u2009<\u20090.01). VMI at 55\u2009keV and IM maintained stable quality across heart rates (p\u2009\u2265\u20090.09).<h4>Conclusion</h4>PCD-CT combining UHR and spectral imaging enhances stent assessment. UHR provides the best lumen visibility and strut accuracy but suffers from motion artifacts, whereas VMIs at 55\u2009keV and IM remain stable across heart rates and potentially provide incremental value.<h4>Relevance statement</h4>Combining UHR and spectral PCD-CT enhances coronary stent visualization by balancing high spatial detail with artifact reduction, potentially improving diagnostic confidence and enabling more reliable non-invasive follow-up across a range of heart rates in clinical practice.<h4>Key points</h4>The combined value of spectral UHR CT for stent imaging remains largely unexplored. UHR PCD-CT showed the highest lumen visibility and sharpest strut delineation, whilst being prone to motion artifacts. Spectral reconstructions complement UHR by reducing artifacts and stabilizing image quality, especially at higher heart rates.",

This investigation employs bibliometric mapping and visualization techniques to delineate emerging trends and intellectual structure within this domain.<h4>Methods</h4>Relevant publications were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) (1900-2024) and analyzed using a suite of bibliometric tools, including CiteSpace, VOSviewer, the R package \"bibliometrix,\" Microsoft Excel 2019, and an online analysis platform.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis encompassed 2929 publications on exercise and cancer pain, produced by 15,771 authors from 3778 institutions across 90 countries, and published in 1039 journals. The United States (830), China (255), and Australia (203) emerged as the leading contributors, with the United States maintaining a dominant position. Key institutions included the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (49 publications) and the University of British Columbia (138.63 average citations per article). Supportive Care in Cancer was identified as the most influential journal in the field. Keywords such as \"symptom management,\" \"patient reported outcomes,\" \"inventory,\" \"case report,\" \"model,\" \"fear,\" \"persistent pain,\" and \"muscle strength\" represented potential future research hotspots.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This bibliometric review confirms expanding scientific engagement with exercise-based cancer pain management. Research advancement requires multi-center studies, standardized metrics, and mechanistic exploration through biomarker-clinical correlation.",

Traditional methods lack precision in simulating esthetic outcomes critical for psychological well-being and clinical success.<h4>Purpose</h4>The purpose of this study was to develop FacePointNet, a bidirectional deep learning model, to predict postrestorative facial changes in edentulous patients after dental restoration, enhancing prerestorative planning through quantitative metrics and expert-rated visual similarity scores (VSSs).<h4>Material and methods</h4>Sixteen edentulous patients underwent pre- and postrestorative 3-dimensional (3D) facial scans. FacePointNet, a point-set neural network with dual registration subnetworks, learned bidirectional geometric transformations using composite loss functions (geometric and consistency losses). Performance was evaluated via 4-fold cross-validation, with metrics including chamfer distance (CD), Euclidean distance (ED), and VSS by 3 oral implant surgeons. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare Pre-Post with Pre-Predicted distributions and was selected because of nonnormal data residuals.<h4>Results</h4>Artificial intelligence (AI)-predicted 3D morphology matched restorative outcomes with mean landmark errors of 3.80 to 5.98\u00a0mm (nasal tip: 2.17\u00a0mm; left commissure: 6.88\u00a0mm). No significant differences were found between the predicted and actual results (P>.05). Expert reviewers reported strong visual concordance (VSS: 4.2/5), particularly in nasolabial folds.<h4>Conclusions</h4>FacePointNet demonstrated clinical utility for the prerestorative visualization of localized facial changes. Future work should expand datasets, integrate biomechanical data, and refine dynamic modeling to enhance global prediction robustness, advancing AI-driven precision prosthodontics.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Thalassemia is a major global health concern, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). Accurate screening of heterozygotes is of paramount importance for diagnostic guidance and disease mitigation.<h4>Methods</h4>Multiclass machine-learning (ML) models were developed to classify alpha, beta, and delta/beta-thalassemia heterozygotes, individuals with iron deficiency microcytic anemia and healthy individuals. Complete blood count (CBC) data were derived from 1518 individuals, simultaneously measured in four different hematological analyzers [Sysmex K-1000 (Sysmex), Cell-Dyn Sapphire (Abbott), ADVIA 2120 (Siemens), BC-6800 (Mindray)]. The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method was applied to investigate the optimal number and combination of hematological parameters required for adequate model training, and their importance was determined using the SHAP method. Random Forest classifier and Active Learning (AL) method were used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy and enhance the model's performance, respectively. Dimensionality reduction techniques were applied for visualization purposes. Additionally, the existence of subclusters within each class was investigated using unsupervised techniques.<h4>Results</h4>Four hematological parameters (MCH, MCV, HGB, and RDW) are sufficient to classify basic types of microcytosis, achieving an accuracy of over 80%. Adding further parameters to the training process can improve the stability and reliability of the model when applied to unseen data, but does not increase test accuracy beyond 90%. Each microcytosis cluster is discriminated by assigning different weights to selected hematological parameters, forming five distinct clusters in the 2D plane (heterozygous alpha-, beta-, and delta/beta-thalassemia, iron deficiency anemia, and normal individuals). The greatest overlap between clusters occurs between alpha- and beta-thalassemia. The alpha-thalassemia cluster appears to have a more diffuse scatter on the 2D plane, but two distinct subclusters are identified within this class, characterized by the differential expression of specific parameters (PCT, MPV, P-LCR, PDW, MCV, MCH, and RBC). The developed model can estimate the probabilities of classifying a new case into the core established clusters and, in the case of alpha-thalassemia, the possible subcluster.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The application of ML models for the automated differential diagnosis of microcytosis, using CBC data, revealed that the diagnostic accuracy is not proportionally dependent on the use of an increasing number of hematological parameters. A developed model is proposed which can correctly classify a new case in the core clusters or subclusters of patients with microcytosis.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe gastrointestinal disease affecting neonates, especially preterm and very low birth weight infants. Recent studies highlight the role of the gut microbiota in neonatal health, with microbial dysbiosis linked to NEC onset. However, bibliometric analyses in this field remain relatively scarce. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the literature related to gut microbiota and NEC published between 1996 and 2024, to outline the development of this research area, identify emerging trends, and provide insights for future investigations.<h4>Methods</h4>Articles and reviews related to gut microbiota and NEC were retrieved through a subject search from Web of Science Core Collection, restricting the document type to articles or reviews and language to English. The relevant literature to be included in the analysis was identified. Subsequently, bibliometric analyses were conducted using Python, CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and the Bibliometrix (R-Tool of R-Studio) software to perform a visualization analysis of basic information and trends regarding journals, countries/regions, influential authors, institutions, keywords, and papers.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 555 relevant articles were published between 1996 and 2024. The number of publications has consistently grown, with a notable surge since 2009. The United States and China are the primary contributors to this body of research, with the United States exerting the greatest influence in this field. Prominent journals include Frontiers in Pediatrics, Nutrients, Frontiers in Microbiology, Pediatric Research, and PLOS One. Influential authors in this area include Sangild PT and Neu J. Key research trends focus on the pathogenesis of the neonatal gut microbiota about NEC, the therapeutic potential of breast milk and probiotics, and the identification of multi-omics biomarkers. Recent literature prominently features keywords such as \"premature infants,\" \"pathogenesis,\" \"breast milk,\" \"NEC,\" \"prebiotics,\" \"probiotics,\" and \"gut microbiota,\" while topics such as \"inflammatory bowel disease\" and \"immune system\" highlight a shift in research priorities, with an increasing focus on understanding pathological mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our analysis highlights the role of gut microbiota in NEC in preterm infants, identifying probiotics and breast milk as potential therapeutic targets. It emphasizes the need for further research on microbiota-based interventions and their safety in neonates.<h4>Impact</h4>Gut microbiota dysbiosis plays a central role in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), particularly in preterm and extremely low birth weight infants. Probiotics and breast milk components are emerging as promising therapeutic and preventive strategies to restore microbial balance and strengthen intestinal defenses. This study presents the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis (1996-2024) of NEC-gut microbiota research, systematically mapping key authors, institutions, journals, and global collaborations, and identifying research hotspots such as probiotics, breast milk, the gut-brain axis, and multi-omics, while also highlighting gaps in mechanistic understanding and safety concerns regarding microbiota-based therapies in neonates. By providing a quantitative overview and roadmap of research trends, the findings enable clinicians and researchers to identify priority areas, support the development of targeted microbiota-based interventions and clinical strategies to reduce NEC incidence and improve neonatal outcomes, and encourage future large-scale, multicenter studies and mechanistic research to translate microbiota insights into safe and effective clinical practice.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Abstract</h4>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) allows precise en-bloc resection of early gastrointestinal neoplasia, reducing recurrence, and increasing cure rates compared with conventional endoscopic mucosal resection. However, its use in the colon remains limited due to the technical complexity, restricted scope maneuverability, and the thin colonic wall. To address these challenges, procedural modifications such as the pocket-creation method (PCM) and traction-assisted techniques have been developed. Since its introduction in 2017, the saline immersion/irrigation technique (SITE) has emerged as an alternative platform to facilitate ESD. SITE differs from approaches referred to as \"underwater-ESD\" as it specifically uses isotonic saline, whose electrolyte content enhances electrical conductivity, enabling effective coagulation, reduced thermal injury, and improved procedural precision. Advantages of SITE include improved visualization through optical magnification and avoidance of smoke-clouding, natural buoyancy providing intrinsic traction, heat-dissipation limiting collateral tissue damage, and reduced luminal distension, contributing to improved patient comfort. When combined with PCM, SITE has been associated with increased dissection speed and reduced procedure time. Current evidence demonstrates that SITE-ESD achieves en-bloc and R0 resection rates comparable to conventional ESD, with similar rates of adverse events, including perforation, bleeding, and post-ESD coagulation syndrome (PECS). The heat-sink effect of saline may further contribute to reduced thermal injury and potentially lower PECS incidence. SITE may also facilitate ESD performance for less experienced endoscopists, expanding accessibility to colorectal ESD. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed to define its optimal role in clinical practice. The term \"saline-immersion/irrigation technique\" should be used to emphasize the importance of the ionic medium.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Archived cardiac specimens are invaluable for understanding congenital heart defects (CHDs) and acquired heart disease. However, physical deterioration and declining autopsy rates limit ongoing acquisition and use. While micro-CT scanning has been used to digitally archive wax-infiltrated specimens, most cardiac specimens in our collection are wet formalin-preserved hearts, for which micro-CT is suboptimal.<h4>Objectives</h4>This study evaluates photogrammetry as a practical, high-fidelity digital archiving technique for wet cardiac specimens.<h4>Methods</h4>Ninety wet cardiac specimens representing a broad spectrum of CHD and other cardiac diseases were digitized using a handheld Artec Space Spider 3D scanner. Specimens were suspended via a custom apparatus to optimize surface coverage. Scan data were processed with Artec Studio and refined in Blender to generate anatomically accurate, textured 3D models. Two experienced cardiac morphologists validated the digital reconstructions against the physical specimens.<h4>Results</h4>Photogrammetry produced high-resolution, color-accurate 3D models closely replicating anatomical details, including complex internal structures. The custom suspension device enhanced visualization, particularly of internal chambers. Challenges included scanning smaller, darker hearts and delicate valve structures, which required manual post-processing. The digital models are accessible via a cloud-based platform for research and education.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Photogrammetry is a practical and effective method for digitally archiving wet cardiac specimens, preserving valuable anatomical data, and mitigating loss due to specimen degradation. This technique facilitates broader accessibility and enhances educational and clinical applications in the study of CHDs and other cardiac diseases.",

This study systematically evaluates the advantages of 7T TOF-MRA compared with 3T in pediatric patients, hypothesizing that 7T would provide superior vessel contrast and increased vascular volume, given the use of smaller voxels, as well as higher SNR, despite these smaller voxels.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant, institutional review board-approved retrospective study included pediatric patients (younger than 19 years of age) who underwent 7T TOF-MRA. Controls consisted of either same-subject 3T MRAs within 6\u2009months (when available) or age- and sex-matched 3T MRA subjects. Imaging parameters were optimized for spatial resolution at 7T to achieve 0.3- to 0.4-mm isotropic voxels. Quantitative analysis included contrast ratio and SNR measurements for the ICA, M1 to M4 arterial segments, and the lenticulostriate perforating arteries. Vascular volume was assessed using 3D segmentation. Semiquantitative vessel conspicuity ratings and motion artifact scoring were performed by blinded neuroradiologists.<h4>Results</h4>Fifteen patients (10 with 7T MRA, 5 with matched 3T controls) and 20 MRAs were analyzed. Contrast ratio was significantly higher at 7T for perforators, M3, and M4 branches (<i>P</i> < .05), with the greatest improvement in the M4 branches. Vascular volume was 147% greater at 7T (<i>P</i> = .018), reflecting improved small-vessel depiction and segmentation. Semiquantitative analysis showed significantly better vessel conspicuity at 7T for the M4 branches and lenticulostriate perforators (<i>P</i> < .01). Motion artifact scores were similar between field strengths (<i>P</i> = .118).<h4>Conclusions</h4>7T TOF-MRA significantly enhances vascular contrast and improves visualization of small arteries compared with 3T, making it a valuable tool for pediatric cerebrovascular imaging.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objectives</h4>Bacterial adhesion to dental restorations plays a critical role in the development of biofilms, contributing to periodontal disease and implant failure. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of glazing and polishing on the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans to three types of CAD/CAM ceramics: lithium disilicate, zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate, and monolithic zirconia.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this experimental in-vitro study, 81 ceramic specimens (n\u2009=\u200981) from three types-zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (VITA Suprinity), lithium disilicate (IPS e.max CAD), and monolithic zirconia (InCoris ZI)-were prepared by polishing, glazing, and left untreated as controls. The bacterial adhesion of Streptococcus mutans was assessed using the crystal violet biofilm assay. Following a 48-hour incubation, optical density (OD) values were measured to quantify bacterial adhesion. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for additional biofilm visualization. The data were analyzed using SPSS software with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, one-way and two-way ANOVA, and Tukey test with a significance level of 0.05.<h4>Results</h4>Polished InCoris ZI demonstrated the lowest bacterial adhesion (0.14). Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between ceramic type and preparation method (p\u2009=\u20090.003), although neither factor alone showed a significant effect. InCoris ZI exhibited significantly higher bacterial adhesion with glazing compared to polishing (p\u2009=\u20090.005), while no significant differences were observed for Suprinity or IPS e.max across preparation methods. Bacterial adhesion to InCoris ZI among glazed samples was significantly higher than Suprinity (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and IPS e.max (p\u2009=\u20090.009).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Preparation methods generally did not significantly influence bacterial adhesion, except for InCoris ZI, where polishing resulted in substantially lower adhesion compared to glazing.<h4>Clinical implications</h4>The study highlights that polishing, particularly for InCoris ZI ceramics, effectively minimizes bacterial adhesion, offering a practical alternative to glazing for in-mouth restoration adjustments. By eliminating the need for laboratory processing, polishing can streamline clinical workflows and reduce chairside time, while still maintaining favorable outcomes. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate surface treatments to enhance the longevity and hygiene of ceramic restorations.",

This topic has recently garnered more attention, highlighting individual variances in precision medicine and individualized clinical trials. It is recognized that individual gene expression variations in males and females could have profound physiological impacts. Tissue specific expression profiles determine protein-coding gene activities and contribute additional physiological variations. Therefore, tissue specific gene expression profiles should be comprehensively analyzed among individual human subjects. In this report, we developed a user-friendly bioinformatic tool to visualize gene expression levels and variances across tissue samples, aiming to facilitate research into potential sexual dimorphism genes. The Gini coefficient metric was used with the most recent GTEx V10 datasets to examine variations in the expression profiles of human protein-coding genes across 43 tissue subtypes. Next, these variations were specifically evaluated using the Gini coefficient index for male and female individuals across all tissue subtypes. Our web-based visualization tool generated tissue specific expression profiles for individual male and female samples. It concurrently illustrates expression levels and variation comparisons between male and female groups across all tissue subtypes. Although most protein-coding genes had similar expression variation patterns between the two sexes, several genes exhibited distinct variations for some tissue subtypes, as indicated by their significant Z-scores in Gini index disparities. Users can explore differentially expressed protein-coding genes across tissue subtypes or search for genes of interest in the Tissue Prominent Sexual Dimorphism Gene database (https://tpsdg.ibms.sinica.edu.tw).\u00a0This database can be employed to visualize expression levels and variations among individual samples within specific tissues, thereby facilitating future research into divergently expressed protein-coding genes in the human population.",

All participants underwent 3D-zoomed imaging technique with parallel transmission real IR (z-3D real IR), z-3D real IR with T2Prep (tz-3D real IR), and optimized tz-3D real IR (otz-3D real IR). Overall image quality, the separation of endolymph and perilymph and EH were scored/graded and compared among three 3D real IRs respectively. The signal intensity ratio (SIR), contrast to noise ratio (CNR), and signal to noise (SNR) were quantitatively calculated and compared among three 3D real IRs respectively.<h4>Results</h4>Tz-3D real IR was superior to z-3D real IR in overall image quality, SIR, SNR, and CNR (P\u2009<\u20090.017 for all), moreover, the vestibular EH detection of tz-3D real IR sequence were inferior to z-3D real IR (P\u2009=\u20090.005). On otz-3D real IR images, overall image quality, endolymph visualization, and the SIR and CNR significantly increased compared to those of the tz-3D real IR sequence and z-3D real IR sequence (P\u2009<\u20090.017 for all). Moreover, the cochlear and vestibular EH detection of otz-3D real IR sequence were significant superior to tz-3D real IR (P\u2009=\u20090.008 for both).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The optimized otz-3D real IR sequence, incorporating T2Prep, significantly improves PE and EH detection. These enhancements highlight its potential utility in clinical settings for accurate and timely diagnosis of EH.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Successful treatment of solid cancers relies on precise diagnosis, e.g. using noninvasive molecular imaging, followed by surgical removal and/or chemo/immunotherapy. Despite advances in pre-operative imaging, real-time intraoperative tools remain limited, which often results in high rates of tumor-positive margins and recurrence after tumor resection. To address this limitation, we aimed to develop multifunctional fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) targeting tracers for bimodal medical imaging, enabling both pre-operative noninvasive molecular imaging via positron emission tomography (PET) and optical visualization during intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery.<h4>Results</h4>NODAGA-FAP647 and NODAGA-FAP800 targeting human FAP (hFAP) were synthesized bearing a (R)-NODAGA chelator and a fluorophore (AlexaFluor647 or IRDye800CW, respectively). Binding affinities and binding kinetics of both unlabeled and <sup>67/68</sup>Ga-labeled compounds were evaluated in vitro using HT1080 cells (hFAP-expressing and wild type, WT) along with respective frozen xenograft tissue sections. Using real-time binding, both compounds exhibited picomolar binding affinities to hFAP via radioactive/fluorescent detection. This was primarily driven by low dissociation rate constants in vitro. Pharmacokinetics and tumor uptake were evaluated via PET and fluorescence imaging in mice bearing xenografts from the same cells. In vivo, both compounds were rapidly distributed and accumulated in hFAP-expressing but not WT-HT1080 tumors within 10-20\u00a0min post-injection. Fluorescence imaging showed a similarly good and selective tumor uptake in the first two hours and a qualitatively visible difference compared to WT-HT1080 beyond 24\u00a0h. Both compounds were quickly cleared from normal tissue and excreted renally.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Two FAP-targeting bimodal ligands were synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo, showing high specificity and selectivity, along with rapid and selective tumor accumulation. Their long tumor retention and high imaging contrast make them promising candidates for clinical translation.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background and purpose</h4>MRI fails to localize a tumor in up to 40% of cases of adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent Cushing disease (CD), impacting patient outcomes and creating uncertainty in the diagnosis. Photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) is a new CT technology with better imaging performance than conventional CT. PCD-CT is a novel imaging technique for CD, especially for MR-negative cases, however, its application to CD remains unknown.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We present a cohort of consecutive patients with a preoperative PCD-CT undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for CD at a single institution from September 2023 to January 2025. All patients underwent gadolinium-enhanced pituitary MRI for baseline work-up and PCD-CT as part of their preoperative planning imaging. Both imaging modalities were used to localize the lesion and guide surgical planning. The accuracies of MRI and PCD-CT were based on confirmation of the lesion location by a combination of intraoperative visualization, pathologic confirmation, and postoperative biochemical remission, and were compared with each other via Fisher exact test.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-five patients with CD were included in this analysis. The cohort's median age was 50 years old, and 88% were women. At diagnosis, 88% had central obesity, 76% had hypertension, 48% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 20% had osteoporosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI accurately identified 56% of lesions, while it was negative in 24% and misleading in 20%. Dynamic contrast-enhanced PCD-CT was superior in localizing CD (<i>P</i> = .01), accurately identifying 92% of lesions, while it was negative in 4% and misleading in 4% of cases. Early postoperative biochemical remission was achieved in 88% of cases, while 84% remained in remission at follow-up.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PCD-CT had a high rate of adenoma localization confirmed intraoperatively, even among MR-negative cases, potentially leading to high remission and gland preservation rates. Its role in the clinical workflow of preoperative evaluation for CD requires further investigation, but current evidence supports its value in lesion localization, especially in MR-negative disease.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Technical advancements in inner ear MRI promise improved diagnosis and management of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease (MD), but a key challenge in optimizing 3D-FLAIR protocols for inner ear imaging lies in selecting the optimal flip angle. This study evaluates the 3 most common flip angle parameters used in 3D-FLAIR imaging for MD through a prospective, head-to-head comparison of image quality at constant flip angle (CFA) 120<sup>\u00b0</sup>, CFA 140<sup>\u00b0</sup>, and variable flip angle (VFA) obtained 4 hours after IV administration of a single-dose gadolinium-based contrast agent.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We prospectively enrolled 16 consecutive patients at our institution's otology clinic on the basis of the 2015 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery criteria for MD, including acute or fluctuating symptoms of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, or aural fullness. Each patient underwent delayed inner ear MRI at 3T with the 3 most commonly used flip angles: CFA 120\u00b0, CFA 140\u00b0, and VFA. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were determined for each flip angle. Assessment of blood-labyrinthine barrier (BLB) permeability, utricle-saccule discrimination, and endolymphatic hydrops (EH) was performed by 2 head and neck neuroradiologists.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-one ears were analyzed. One ear was excluded on the basis of a prior history of left labyrinthectomy after failed medical management of MD. There were 17 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic ears determined by clinical and hearing evaluation. The SNR of the perilymphatic space and CNR of the endolymphatic space were significantly higher at CFA 140<sup>\u00b0</sup>, followed by CFA 120<sup>\u00b0</sup>, and then VFA (<i>P</i> < .05). There was significantly improved visualization of EH, the utricle-saccule complex, and BLB permeability at CFA 140<sup>\u00b0</sup> (<i>P</i> < .05), with excellent interobserver agreement (\u03ba > 0.80).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study demonstrates that 3D-FLAIR inner ear imaging using CFA 140<sup>\u00b0</sup> and single-dose IV gadolinium contrast at 3T is a reliable method for detecting EH.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objectives</h4>Fluorescence tumor-targeted imaging is a sensitive technique that may assist surgeons to remove residual cancer tissue during resection. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a tumor-associated cell-surface glycoprotein, upregulated in hypoxic environments, and a suitable biomarker to develop targeted dyes for fluorescence-guided surgery. This study describes design, synthesis, in vitro and in vivo assessment of novel CAIX-targeting fluorescent probes based on the well-known drug acetazolamide, addressing the contribution of both targeting moiety and fluorophore structure on imaging efficacy.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>All the CAIX-targeting heptamethine cyanines synthesized and described in the present work were characterized in terms of their optical properties in different media. The affinity to human serum albumin was evaluated by UV-VIS spectrophotometry. The affinity to the CA catalytic site was determined on a recombinant bovine CAII enzyme (bCAII), with a fluorescent-based assay. Human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, highly expressing CAIX, were used for the in vitro characterization, including cell binding, uptake and competition assays, by flow cytometry. Finally, the in vivo tumor targeting efficacy of a selected group of probes was assessed by Optical Imaging in a mouse subcutaneous tumor from HT-29 cells, characterized by both expression of CAIX and a hypoxic tumor microenvironment.<h4>Results</h4>First, a family of CAIX-targeting probes was prepared by functionalizing a novel glucamine-bearing heptamethine cyanine (Dye1) with a modified acetazolamide moiety, whose acetyl group was replaced with i) aminooctanoic acid C8 , ii) phenylalanine, iii) amino-PEG2-acid and iv) the longer linker 4a , or 2 commercially available benzenesulfonamides. From the in vitro screening of this first group of compounds, the C8-AZA targeting moiety was selected due to its highest affinity. Indeed, Dye1-C8-AZA exhibited the lowest K D values for both bCAII (6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u2009nM) and CAIX-expressing HT-29 cells (58\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009nM), even lower than HypoxyFluor-1 (HF-1), a CAIX-targeted dye already reported in the literature. Then, other heptamethine cyanines (Dye2-Dye5, linear or cyclic, with different substituents on the indolenines and different conjugation position of the targeting vector) were functionalized with C8-AZA and fully characterized both in vitro and in vivo , to evaluate the combinatory effect of vector and fluorophore on the performance of the resulting probes. The different chemical features of the cyanines influenced the optical properties, solubility, binding with albumin, biodistribution, and imaging efficacy of the probes, while leaving unaffected the high affinity to the target. When tested in vivo for the visualization of CAIX-expressing HT-29 tumors, all C8-AZA probes showed high and specific tumor accumulation, often superior to HF-1.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Several CAIX-targeting probes were synthesized to test the combinatory effect of different molecular vectors and dyes on the biological properties. All probes containing the C8-AZA targeting moiety displayed higher affinity and specificity to the target, while imaging efficacy in vivo was strongly influenced also by the structure of the labelling dye. All probes, and among them especially Dye1-C8-AZA, displayed efficient in vivo tumor accumulation. These results support further studies toward clinical testing of CAIX as suitable target for tumor fluorescence imaging and pave the way for future clinical applications.",
