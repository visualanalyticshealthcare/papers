Bibliometric and visualization analyses were performed using VOSviewer software.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 16,862 publications were retrieved, with a notable increase in publication output after 2016. The United States led in both publication numbers (n = 6502, 38.56%) and citations (342,586), underscoring its substantial contribution to this field. Influential institutions such as the University of Pittsburgh and Karolinska Institute played key roles. Keywords analysis identified 631 meaningful topics, classified into five clusters, with research hotspots focusing on cardiovascular diseases, dementia, frailty, and quality of life. Emerging keywords in public health and nursing, such as \"mild cognitive impairment,\" \"multimorbidity,\" and \"frailty,\" have been frequently highlighted in recent studies, indicating critical priorities for future research in elderly care.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric and visualization analysis of global research trends on diseases in the elderly population. It highlights key research areas and offers valuable insights to guide future directions in public health and nursing strategies, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to address aging-related challenges.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Cumulative risk assessment (CRA) is key to characterizing health risks in fenceline and disadvantaged communities, which face environmental pollution and challenging socioeconomic conditions. Traditional approaches for inclusion of mixtures in CRA are limited and only assess the most sensitive target organ system for each chemical.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed an expanded approach to cumulative risk assessment that considers all known target organ systems associated with a chemical. Specifically, we created a multi-effects toxicity database by 1) compiling toxicological and epidemiological data from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's (ATSDR) Toxicological Profiles and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) CompTox Chemicals Dashboard; 2) developing a tiering system to prioritize identified data for use in developing toxicity values; and 3) accounting for uncertainty to create toxicity values for additional target organ systems. We demonstrated differences between the traditional approach and our expanded approach by using state-of-the-art mobile monitoring data from our Southeastern Pennsylvania Hazardous Air Pollutant Monitoring and Assessment Project (SEPA HAP-MAP) to conduct a cumulative risk assessment.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 32 chemicals quantified in SEPA HAP-MAP, 28 were represented in our multi-effects toxicity database, whereas only 16 were included using a traditional approach. In total, we derived toxicity values for 172 chemical-target organ system combinations. Our expanded approach found neurological, renal, respiratory, endocrine, and systemic risks (hazard index >1) in SEPA HAP-MAP fenceline communities, whereas no risks were identified using a traditional approach limited to the most sensitive target organ systems only.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results suggest that traditional approaches to CRA underestimate health risks in fenceline and other highly exposed communities and highlight the need for improved methods to inform health-protective and just risk management decisions. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP14696.",

However, the clinical used colonoscopy and biopsy methods are invasive and lack of sensitivity at early-stage of cancerization. Here, an amplified sensing strategy is developed in the second near-infrared long-wavelength subregion (NIR-II-L, 1500-1900\u00a0nm) by integrating DNAzyme-triggered signal amplification technology and lanthanide-dye hybrid system. In the early-stage of CRC, the overexpressed biomarker microRNA-21 initiates the NIR-II-L luminescence ratiometric signal amplification of the CRCsensor. The high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.26 pm allows non-invasive visualization of orthotopic colorectal cancerization via rectal administration, which achieves early and accurate in situ diagnosis at 2 weeks ahead of the in vitro histological results. This innovative approach offers a promising tool for early diagnosis and long-term monitoring of carcinogenesis progression, with potential applications in other cancer-related biomarkers.",

      "abstractText": "Fluorescence imaging has been a powerful technique for the visualization of interest biomolecules. It is widely used in basic biological research, clinical medicine, and other fields. However, the fluorescence signals are often too weak for detecting with simple devices or in complex environments. Besides, fluorescence signals are limited to about four to six dyes, restricting to the spectral overlap of organic fluorophores. DNA nanotechnology including structured and dynamic DNA nanotechnology emerges as a promising material to encode fluorophores, holding great potential to improve the properties of fluorescence signals. Substantial progresses have been achieved in the DNA-encoded fluorescence signals, exhibiting novel characteristics and applications. This review summarizes various DNA encoding strategies with fluorescence signals and their performance in imaging analysis. In this review, different DNA encoding methods and their impacts on the fluorescence signals in imaging is reported, such as brightness, photostability, kinetics, and multiplexing. Besides, the biological application of DNA-encoded signals are reviewed. Finally, potential solutions to address current challenges in DNA-encoded fluorescence signals are suggested, encouraging the future development of this area.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Type II endoleaks (T2EL) are a common complication after endovascular aneurysm repair. AneuFix is a newly designed elastic polymer for T2EL. AneuFix contains tantalum for visualization during fluoroscopy, which is crucial for monitoring the polymer in the side branches. The purpose of this study was to find the lowest concentration tantalum that is sufficient for safe injection in the aneurysmal sac.<h4>Methods</h4>AneuFix polymer with tantalum concentrations between 0 and 30% was injected into endoleak phantoms, connected to a pulsatile flow setup and with a realistic background for fluoroscopy. Furthermore, the radiopacity was investigated on fluoroscopic systems from three different vendors, using static phantoms. Results from both the dynamic and static phantoms were qualitatively evaluated by 10 clinical experts.<h4>Results</h4>Concentrations of\u2009\u2265\u200920% tantalum were consistently detected within the first 5 mm after entering the side branch, with a corresponding contrast-to-noise ratio of 2.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21. Furthermore, sufficient detectability scores (of at least 3 out of 5) were given to\u2009\u2265\u200915% tantalum. Significant differences were found in detectability scores on different fluoroscopic systems, using the default lowest-radiation-dose scan protocol for each system.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study showed that tantalum concentrations\u2009\u2265\u200920% are consistently detected on fluoroscopy in the specified region. Compared to the original 30%, this would reduce imaging artifacts from high attenuation and scattering on follow-up imaging, while retaining sufficient detectability during injection. However, because of differences in fluoroscopic systems and scan protocols between hospitals, the combination of tantalum concentration and scan protocol should be optimized for each clinical setting.",

      "abstractText": "Changes in cell number during in vitro experiments and pharmacological screenings primarily depend on two factors: cell death and proliferation. The dynamics of these processes determine whether cell populations expand and accumulate or, conversely, decrease over time. Understanding the biological mechanisms governing these changes is crucial for deciphering the mode of action of any pharmacological or genetic treatment in fundamental research and pre-clinical trials. In this context, we introduce a robust and efficient flow cytometry-based methodology that enables comprehensive analysis of key cellular parameters that indicate changes in cell numbers. This approach encompasses the assessment of cell count along with critical maintenance parameters including proliferation, cell cycle dynamics, apoptosis, cell permeability, and mitochondrial depolarization. These parameters are intricately linked, offering a detailed view of the cellular state. The described methodology is versatile and adaptable for analyzing various cell types, whether at steady state or in response to treatments. To develop this workflow, we integrated and optimised multiple flow cytometry-based stainings such as annexin V, propidium iodide, bromodeoxyuridine, CellTrace Violet, and JC-1 into a unified protocol. This article offers a detailed, step-by-step guide to the entire method, covering aspects such as timing, sample preparation techniques, and the reagents used. Additionally, it includes examples of the data that can be obtained with this technique and illustrates its multiparametric visualization. Collectively, this methodology facilitates the rapid acquisition of up to eight different parameters from a single sample in one experiment.",

      "abstractText": "Immunity has vital research value and promising applications in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Nevertheless, few bibliometric analyses have systematically investigated this area. This study aimed to comprehensively review the collaboration and impact of countries, institutions, authors, and journals on the role of immunity in TNBC from a bibliometric perspective, evaluate the keyword co-occurrence of the knowledge structure, and identify hot trends and emerging topics. Articles and reviews related to immunity in TNBC were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection using subject search. A bibliometric study was conducted primarily using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. A total of 3,104 articles and reviews were included from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2024. The number of articles on immunization in TNBC is rising. These publications are mainly from 415 institutions in 82 countries, led by China and the USA. Among these publications, Lajos Pusztai published the most papers, while Peter Schmid was co-cited the most. The most productive journals focused on molecular biology, biological immunology, and clinical medicine.

      "abstractText": "Dynamic visualization of the hepatic vessel is crucial in X-ray image-guided transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures. However, intraoperative breathing and the presence of guidewires complicate the prediction of the vessel position and posture without contrast agents. The respiration compensation technique aims to utilize the intraoperative respiration modeling to deform the initial vessel roadmap, thereby achieving the dynamic vessel prediction in the X-ray image sequence for the interventional guidance. Therefore, we propose a novel respiration compensation framework utilizing the adaptive tracking and bending energy modeling to achieve the stable vessel roadmap prediction under free breathing. First, we introduce the inter-frame rigid displacement compensation module based on the domain adaptation and adaptive centroid tracking. This module fits the respiratory curve from the X-ray images, providing the temporal motion priors for aligning roadmaps across frames. Second, we propose the novel deformation compensation module based on the bending energy modeling to correct the respiratory motion, wherein we utilize the energy features of the guidewires to drive the non-rigid registration. The control points sampled by the bending energy guide the local image to form the deformation field, facilitating the dynamic overlap of the deformed vessel roadmaps in X-ray images. Experimental results on simulated and clinical datasets show an average tracking error of 0.95 0.26\u00a0mm and 1.49 0.40\u00a0mm, respectively. The effective and fast (mean 57\u00a0ms per frame) compensation achieved by our framework has the potential for improving the outcome of liver intervention and reducing the reliance on contrast agents.",

      "abstractText": "Atherosclerotic plaque calcification is an oxidative-stress-dependent process involved in the onset of plaque disruption and subsequent atherothrombotic events. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production determines the structural modification of protein cysteine sulfhydryl (Cys-SH), leading to the alteration of protein functions and redox signaling outputs. Although these redox-centered signaling pathways have been found to play important roles in plaque calcification, the extent of protein Cys-SH modifications and the regulatory regions of specific proteins remains unclear. This is due to the lack of tools that can visually distinguish and characterize the oxidation products of different Cys-SH proteins, especially protein sulfination (Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H). Herein, we present a novel \"turn-on\" fluorescent probe (Z-1) for the in situ visualization of Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H modifications and investigate its effects on the initiation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. In vitro and in vivo imaging with Z-1, cigarette smoking-induced VSMC calcification, display a significant increase in protein Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H levels. Protein spectrum analysis reveals that Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H modification occurred at the sulfhydryl active sites of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1). These oxidative modifications are desired to dysregulate the ROS/Keap1/nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant signaling pathway and accelerate the calcification process. Furthermore, elevated levels of Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H observed in serum samples from patients with acute myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction give clinical evidence of the relevance of protein Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H modification in pathological calcification.",
