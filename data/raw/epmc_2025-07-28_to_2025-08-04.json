This study describes the development of the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center Veteran Dashboard (VetDash), a patient-level clinical dashboard designed to integrate the VA's <i>Collect, Share, Act</i> model into the provider workflow.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>VetDash was developed using R Shiny, utilizing data from the WRIISC Clinical Intake Packet Database. It integrates patient-reported health data and military history into a dashboard hosted on a Linux-based Shiny Server within the VA's intranet.<h4>Results</h4>VetDash includes four modules: Patient Characteristics, Patient Health Symptoms, Patient Exposures, and Patient Self-Report Measures. Providers can visualize patient-reported symptoms, military exposures, and self-report measures, and compare patients to provider-defined cohorts.<h4>Discussion and conclusion</h4>VetDash facilitates MBC integration into the clinical workflow, potentially improving personalized patient care. Future research should evaluate its impact on clinical decisions, outcomes, and explore further enhancements.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Digital dashboards are interactive, visual displays that provide real-time identification of clinical and service performance trends. Few studies have reported their use in characterising feeding clinic care for children with paediatric feeding disorder (PFD). This study used data from a digital dashboard at a children's hospital to compare populations and service utilisation across four outpatient feeding clinics: speech pathology-only (SP-only), dietetics and speech pathology (DT-SP), occupational therapy and speech pathology (OT-SP), and dietetics, occupational therapy, and speech pathology (DT-OT-SP).<h4>Methods</h4>This single-centre, retrospective study used 2023 digital dashboard data to compare the demographics (i.e., cultural background) and service utilisation (e.g., appointment scheduling) of the four clinics.<h4>Results</h4>Data relating to 551 children were analysed. Significant differences were found between clinics for demographics, wait times, scheduling, delivery methods, attendance, and outcomes. Children referred for suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia and infants were prioritised for earlier management, whereas those requiring OT-SP intervention waited longest. Infants received the most intensive hospital-based management, whereas children with oropharyngeal dysphagia did not require long-term hospital-based follow-up. Children in DT-OT-SP were more likely to receive telehealth appointments, whilst those in OT-SP had the lowest telehealth utilisation. Children from culturally and linguistically diverse communities were more likely to attend OT-SP or DT-OT-SP. OT-SP had a higher likelihood of missed appointments and was less likely to need a review waiting list.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Findings support multi-tiered multidisciplinary feeding clinics in addressing the clinical and service needs associated with different types of PFD. Results inform future development needs of digital dashboards.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Despite the potential of digital adherence technologies to support patient-centered monitoring for tuberculosis (TB), there is limited research on incorporating indirect and direct adherence monitoring or assessing patients' experiences with these technologies. The TB Treatment Support Tools (TB-TST) includes a comprehensive mobile app for patients and health care providers and a direct adherence metabolite test to report and monitor adherence.<h4>Objective</h4>This paper describes the iterative refinement process of the TB-TST intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>To refine the TB-TST intervention, we used an iterative approach involving multiple embedded mixed methods studies guided by the Information Systems Research framework and Design Thinking Process. Embedded studies included a randomized controlled pilot study, interviews, usability testing, and surveys with patients and experts to inform ongoing refinements. The project consisted of interface evaluation, high-level system design, and iterative redesign.<h4>Results</h4>The TB-TST intervention was refined through 3 iterative phases. In Phase 1, based on feedback from pilot study participants and 4 experts in TB, improvements included an in-app discussion board, submission confirmations, and enhanced account recovery. Cultural adaptation was based on Hofstede's dimensions. Phase 2 involved 4 Directed Research Groups and 19 stakeholders to redesign user flows, simplify reporting, and transition the app to a progressive web app, improving device compatibility. Phase 3 included usability testing cycles with 48 participants (26 patients and 22 health care professionals), yielding high satisfaction scores: patient app Mobile Health App Usability Questionnaire, mean 5.96 (SD 0.46); provider mobile dashboard IT Usability Evaluation Scale scores ranged from 5.83 to 6.23 out of 7, and optimization of interface and dashboard. Refinements included larger icons, streamlined onboarding, symptom summary enhancements, and a new cohort-level adherence graph. These modifications improved navigation, usability, and remote monitoring for patients with TB and providers in preparation for a multisite clinical trial.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Combining multiple methods guided by the Information Systems Research framework and elements of the Design Thinking Process can help researchers and developers leverage the strengths of mixed methods iterative designs to create highly personalized and effective digital health interventions.",

      "abstractText": "This paper examines sleep patterns in Romania, a country where long working hours and significant household responsibilities may impact rest. The study highlights key factors influencing perceived sleep quality, with the aim to offer insights for clinicians. Based on a cross-sectional survey 835 with Romanian respondents by the Francophone Space of Pneumology from 2019 to 2020, the study predates the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore avoids potential post-pandemic sleep disruptions. Participants reported their sleep habits, medical conditions, psychological well-being, and work conditions. The study assesses how these factors relate to sleep quality, sleep duration, insomnia, and sleep disturbances. Multivariate analysis reveals that individual perceptions of sleep quality can be misleading when analyzed in isolation. Through hierarchical models, we identify specific predictors of sleep quality. Multivariate analysis showed that good bedroom conditions (OR\u2009=\u20091.63) and physical activity (OR\u2009=\u20091.45) were associated with better sleep perception. Night shifts, female gender, and co-sleeping with pets (OR\u2009=\u20093.68) increased risk of sleep problems. Medical predictors (e.g., STOP-Bang) were not significantly associated. The results are also presented in a practical dashboard, helping healthcare professionals assess sleep disorders more effectively while identifying potential biases in self-reported sleep quality.",

      "abstractText": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have shown significant promise in diabetes treatment through immunobiological mechanisms. To comprehensively understand the current development status and future trends of this research field, this study used bibliometric methods to retrieve literature data from the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2004 to 2024 and conducted a comprehensive analysis using R software and VOSviewer. A total of 900 papers were published by 4,678 authors from 56 countries, with global publication volume and average citation frequency peaking in 2019, after which the field entered a stable development phase. The United States emerged as the leading contributor in terms of total publications, citations, and national collaborations. The journal <i>Diabetes</i> had the highest publication output. Herold KC from Yale University ranked highest in publication count, citation frequency, and Hirsch index. Four key research focuses were identified in T1D: the multifaceted roles of mAbs in clinical trials (a hot mature topic), developing therapeutic targets through animal models (a centralized, declining topic), inducing immune tolerance in transplantation using mAbs (a mature, declining topic), and assessing the safety, risk, and efficacy of mAbs in diabetes treatment (a niche and well-developed topic). Substantial clinical progress has already been achieved with mAbs targeting autoimmune destruction in T1D, while therapeutic strategies for metabolic dysregulation in T2D are primarily in the preclinical stage yet show promising potential. Advancing combination therapies, personalizing treatments, and enhancing mechanistic research will improve the safety and efficacy of mAbs in diabetes management, providing valuable insights for future research in this field.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major concern in drug safety, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) provides valuable ADR data. However, analyzing FAERS data is complex and requires bioinformatics expertise. Despite the vast amount of ADR data available, there is a lack of user-friendly tools that enable efficient visualization and comparison of ADRs for researchers and health care professionals.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to develop VisDrugs, a web-based platform that simplifies ADR visualization and comparison using FAERS data. The platform was designed to assist researchers and clinicians in assessing drug safety through interactive and interpretable graphical representations of ADR patterns.<h4>Methods</h4>FAERS data were extracted in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format, covering the period from Q3 (third quarter) 2014 to Q3 2024. About 2,700,000 reports from health care professionals, where only a single drug was implicated, were aggregated and processed using R for statistical analysis and visualization. The results are presented on a web-based platform for web-based analysis. The platform generates pie charts to visualize the most frequently reported ADRs, which are represented and analyzed using preferred terms based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and forest plots illustrating reporting odds ratios (RORs) for these ADRs.<h4>Results</h4>Using Paxlovid (COVID-19 treatment) and hydroxychloroquine (anti-malaria drug) as case studies, we benchmarked VisDrugs using reports for Paxlovid (n=16,708) and hydroxychloroquine (n=6150). Paxlovid was most frequently associated with \"COVID-19\" (ROR=47.26, 95% CI 45.22-49.40) and \"dysgeusia\" (ROR=59.65, 95% CI 55.56-64.03). Hydroxychloroquine showed strong associations with \"retinal toxicity\" (ROR=738.48, 95% CI 583.45-934.71), \"retinopathy\" (ROR=412.27, 95% CI 344.73-493.03), and \"cardiotoxicity\" (ROR=48.36, 95% CI 38.86-60.19). In subgroup analyses, female patients had significantly higher risks of retinopathy (3.24-fold) and cardiomyopathy (13.82-fold) compared to male patients, while patients aged >50 years had higher risks of retinopathy (4.20-fold) and cardiomyopathy (7.84-fold) compared to those \u226450 years. All differences were statistically significant (z test, P<.01). The majority of findings align with existing research, thereby validating the platform's utility. Clinical personnel have evaluated and refined the platform based on user feedback, confirming its efficacy in visualizing complex ADR data and identifying adverse effects across various drug subgroups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>VisDrugs is a valuable tool for ADR analysis, offering an intuitive interface for exploring FAERS data. By visualizing and comparing ADRs, it helps researchers and health care providers assess drug safety efficiently. The platform's demographic analysis features add insights into ADR variations by age and gender, supporting drug safety research. In the future, the website will include more subgroup or condition filtering options, offering personalized ADR analysis and comparison features to meet the diverse research needs of users.",

Here, we disclose two PET tracers containing three key design elements: (1) an organotrifluoroborate for one-step radiofluorination at Curie levels of [<sup>18</sup>F] fluoride in good yields and high molar activity (A<sub>m</sub>) values: 42-167 GBq/\u03bcmol, (2) two fluorescein moieties (FAM and FITC) for fluorescent visualization, and (3) two pharmacophores based on clinically validated scaffolds PSMA-617 and PSMA-1007. These tracers are the first-ever examples of dual-mode PSMA-targeting agents that are labeled with both fluorescein and fluorine-18. Both were evaluated using LNCaP and 22Rv1 xenografts and show high tumor uptake (7-17% ID/g), strong fluorescent visualization on cultured LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells, and fluorescence detection <i>ex vivo</i>. These results highlight the potential of PSMA-targeting dual-mode tracers for clinical translation in PET imaging, surgical navigation, fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), and radioguided surgery (RGS).",

      "abstractText": "Wearable flexible sensors have aroused great interest owing to their widespread use in medical monitoring, wearable sensing, and human-computer interaction. However, conventional flexible sensors have a single signal response and are susceptible to mechanical damage, thus limiting their potential applications. Here, a self-powered flexible sensor using a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE)-based sandwiched architecture with mechanochromism and triboelectric response is developed. The sensor is constructed by laminating poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) from two sides to the middle CLCE layer, and a thin silver nanowire (AgNWs) is adhesive to the bottom PDMS layer used as a conductor. Specifically, the dynamic covalent bonds endow PDMS and CLCE layers with excellent self-healing performance, and the CLCE layer has a stable mechanochromism characteristic due to the variations of the helical structure upon mechanical forces. The consequent sandwiched-structure sensor has a fast electric response to the applied pressure with a response time of 139 ms and excellent cyclic response stability, which allows for monitoring human motion, as a self-powered wearable sensor. Finally, a self-powered sensing smart ring for medical monitoring of the patients with mobility problems in the hospital is demonstrated through visualization signals of structural color shift in the daytime, the \"LED\" light powered by finger tapping in the night-time, or the electric signal response in the special demand. This work demonstrates that CLCE-based self-powered sensors have promising applications in flexible wearables, human-computer interactions, and smart healthcare.",

This study aimed to assess the utility of the Itch Tracker (Maruho Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan), a smartwatch application, in visualizing nocturnal scratching and facilitating shared decision-making (SDM) in two pediatric AD cases treated with nemolizumab. Objective monitoring revealed discrepancies between self-reported itch and actual scratching behavior, leading to appropriate treatment initiation and significant improvements in scratching behavior, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), and numerical rating scale (NRS) scores. These results highlight the clinical value of behavioral visualization in enhancing SDM and optimizing management in pediatric\u00a0AD.",

The improvement opportunities of the traditional testing practice, however, are not well translated to and recognized by the occupational health and indoor air quality community, partly due to the lack of a comprehensive review and analysis of pertinent advancements in fume hood containment performance evaluation. This motivated a systematic attempt to review recent advancements in testing devices and methodology that support fume hood containment performance evaluation in a more sustainable and optimized way. In this context, emerging technologies and innovative practices in three categories-namely, face velocity measurement, airflow visualization analysis, and tracer gas containment test-are elaborated in terms of testing devices and methodology. With those advancements, an improved process of fume hood performance evaluation is proposed. Furthermore, challenges in adopting emerging technologies and innovative practices are highlighted and discussed. The findings and recommendations in this study serve as a valuable reference for revising current fume hood performance evaluation standards, further guiding chemical exposure risk assessment, and informing ventilation control strategy.",

The process included three phases: (1) exploratory stage for context assessment, (2) planning through a needs assessment, and (3) a co-creation core for public space ideation and prototyping. AR and VR technologies were used to support spatial visualization and immersive prototyping. A mixed-methods evaluation assessed the co-creation process, including participant engagement and outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>As a protocol paper, no empirical results are reported. However, the structure of the co-creation process, participant roles, and evaluation framework are detailed to guide implementation and inspiration for planning future projects using co-creation for urban design and healthy ageing.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This protocol offers a transferable model for integrating co-creation into urban design and planning with older adults. It supports inclusive design and adds to the growing evidence on participatory methods for addressing complex urban health challenges.",

      "abstractText": "Uranium poses severe health risks due to its chemo- and radiotoxicities, particularly during nuclear accidents. Despite recent advances in uranyl decorporation agents, clinically effective agents remain scarce. The optimization of uranium decorporation agents is severely impeded partially because the current assessment methods are complicated and time-consuming, which often results in delayed feedback. Real-time, visualized monitoring techniques are critically needed to advance chelation therapy. Here, we strategically developed a uranyl-specific DNAzyme-based \"turn-on\" nanoprobe for visualizing uranium decorporation in vivo. The probe features a fluorophore and its quencher attached to different DNAzyme ends, which separate upon uranyl-induced selective cleavage, resulting in the recovery of the fluorescence emission intensity. In uranium-exposed mice, the nanoprobe detected the deposited uranyl in kidneys with 1.8-fold enhanced emission intensity versus that of controls, demonstrating excellent in vivo imaging capability. Importantly, the probe successfully distinguished uranyl content differences in contaminated mice treated with or without the decorporation agent, providing a rapid evaluation of treatment efficiency. These findings establish DNAzyme@QDots as an effective biological probe for real-time visualization of uranyl decorporation and signify its future application in nuclear emergency response.",

      "abstractText": "Peripherally inserted central catheters are increasingly utilized, but placement can be challenging due to anatomical constraints and the need for an adequate catheter-to-vein ratio and optimal exit site positioning. This paper presents a novel approach combining in-plane oblique axis ultrasound guidance with pseudotunneling for catheter insertion in a complex anatomical scenario. A patient requiring long-term venous access presented with a target vein located near the axillary cavity, positioned beneath the axillary artery and musculocutaneous nerve, precluding the standard short axis out-of-plane puncture. Therefore, an in-plane oblique axis technique was employed, enabling continuous real-time visualization of surrounding structures and the needle's trajectory. This approach facilitated safe vein cannulation while creating a subcutaneous pseudotunnel to relocate the exit site to the desired green zone. The technique, described through a clinical case, involved oblique probe angulation, in-plane needle insertion, and pseudotunnel creation. This method demonstrates the feasibility and safety of in-plane oblique-axis ultrasound guidance combined with pseudotunneling for catheter insertion in challenging anatomical conditions, ensuring an optimal catheter-to-vein ratio and appropriate exit site placement.",

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the surgical cases of AVV repair and assessed the impact of IP3DE.<h4>Methods</h4>We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent AVV repair at Nagano Children's Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups, the IP3DE group and the control group, which underwent two-dimensional transesophageal or transthoracic echocardiography. Clinical data, including the grade of regurgitation and re-intervention, were compared between the two groups.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-six patients in the IP3DE group and 35 in the control group were included. The preoperative median grade was 3 (maximum 2-minimum 4) and 3 (2-4) in the IP3DE and control groups, respectively. After surgery, median grade was decreased to 1 (1-4) and 2 (1-4) in the IP3DE and control groups, respectively. 80% and 54% of patients showed successful outcome (grade\u2009\u2264\u20092 after repair) in the IP3DE and control groups, respectively, which demonstrated that IP3DE contributed significantly to successful outcome (p\u2009<\u20090.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrated, for the first time, the effectiveness of IP3DE in AVV repair in pediatric patients. IP3DE allows the visualization of clear 3D images and easy information sharing among cardiac vascular surgeons.",

      "abstractText": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, often diagnosed using X-rays due to its cost-effectiveness. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides superior soft tissue visualization and serves as a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool, its high cost and limited accessibility significantly restrict its widespread use. To explore the feasibility of bridging this imaging gap, we conducted a feasibility study leveraging a diffusion-based model that uses an X-ray image as conditional input, alongside target depth and additional patient-specific feature information, to generate corresponding MRI sequences. Our findings demonstrate that the MRI volumes generated by our approach are not only visually closer to real MRI scans compared with other methods but also achieve the highest quantitative performance in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Furthermore, by increasing the number of inference steps to interpolate between slice depths, we enhance the continuity of the generated volume, achieving higher adjacent slice correlation coefficients. Through ablation studies, we further validate that integrating supplemental patient-specific information, beyond what X-rays alone can provide, enhances the accuracy and clinical relevance of the generated MRI, which underscores the potential of leveraging external patient-specific information to improve the performance of the MRI generation.

      "abstractText": "<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aimed to develop a fully automated 3D multi-modal deep learning model using preoperative <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT to predict the T-stage of colorectal cancer (CRC) and evaluate its clinical utility.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective cohort of 474 CRC patients was included, with 400 patients for internal cohort and 74 patients for external cohort. Patients were classified into early T-stage (T1-T2) and advanced T-stage (T3-T4) groups. Automatic segmentation of the volume of interest (VOI) was achieved based on TotalSegmentator. A 3D ResNet18-based deep learning model integrated with a cross-multi-head attention mechanism was developed. Five models (CT\u2009+\u2009PET\u2009+\u2009Clinic (CPC), CT\u2009+\u2009PET (CP), PET (P), CT (C), Clinic) and two radiologists' assessment were compared. Performance was evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC). Grad-CAM was employed to provide visual interpretability of decision-critical regions.<h4>Results</h4>The automated segmentation achieved Dice scores of 0.884 (CT) and 0.888 (PET). The CPC and CP models achieved superior performance, with AUCs of 0.869 and 0.869 in the internal validation cohort, respectively, outperforming single-modality models (P: 0.832; C: 0.809; Clinic: 0.728) and the radiologists (AUC: 0.627, P\u2009<\u20090.05 for all models vs. radiologists, except for the Clinical model). External validation exhibited a similar trend, with AUCs of 0.814, 0.812, 0.763, 0.714, 0.663 and 0.704, respectively. Grad-CAM visualization highlighted tumor-centric regions for early T-stage and peri-tumoral tissue infiltration for advanced T-stage.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The fully automated multimodal, fusing PET/CT with cross-multi-head-attention, improved T-stage prediction in CRC, surpassing the single-modality models and radiologists, offering a time-efficient tool to aid clinical decision-making.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) has garnered considerable attention and demonstrated substantial clinical benefits across multiple surgical specialties. However, its integration into cranial and spinal neurosurgery remains nascent and fraught with challenges. This study aims to systematically assess the current research landscape, identify emerging hotspots, and forecast future directions for ERAS in neurosurgery through comprehensive bibliometric analysis. These findings seek to inform clinical practice and guide future investigations.<h4>Methods</h4>Relevant publications indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection from January 1, 1999, to December 1, 2024, were analyzed. Bibliometric tools, primarily CiteSpace, were utilized to evaluate annual publication trends, author and institutional contributions, journal dissemination, keyword co-occurrence, and citation network structures.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 273 articles were included. The analysis reveals that ERAS implementation in spinal neurosurgery has reached a relatively advanced stage, while its application in cranial procedures remains underdeveloped, yet promising. The United States and China are leading in publication output, although China's global influence is comparatively limited. Key research themes include hospital length of stay, cost-effectiveness, postoperative complication management, and multimodal analgesia. Anticipated trends suggest a growing focus on personalized ERAS protocols tailored to specific neurosurgical conditions and enhanced patient engagement in recovery processes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Through bibliometric and visualization techniques, this study offers a comprehensive overview of ERAS-related neurosurgical research, delineating its evolution and thematic shifts. The insights derived herein may facilitate strategic planning, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and promote evidence-based advancements in perioperative neurosurgical care.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Transthoracic echocardiography remains the primary non-invasive method for assessing cardiac function in clinical practice. However, technical challenges in acquiring accurate apical 4-chamber-long-axis (A4CLAX) views have historically limited mouse studies to left ventricle (LV) assessment using parasternal short-axis (SAX) M-mode imaging.<h4>Methods</h4>To overcome this limitation, we developed an A4CLAX imaging approach for mice and performed a comparative analysis with established echocardiographic methods to assess cardiac function in healthy mouse hearts. To evaluate the utility of A4CLAX in detecting disease progression, we longitudinally monitored cardiac function of C57BL/6\u2009N mice (male and female) following severe transverse aortic constriction (TAC), using both long-axis biplane (LAX-BP) and conventional SAX M-mode assays.<h4>Results</h4>Here we show that LAX-BP echocardiography demonstrates volumetric accuracy comparable to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and detects significant LV functional decline within the first week post-TAC-changes that are not clearly captured by M-mode imaging. Importantly, A4CLAX further enables clinically relevant Doppler assessments, allowing detection of mitral valve regurgitation, restrictive filling patterns, and desynchronized valve motion. It also facilitates right ventricle (RV) functional evaluation and improved atrial visualization, revealing progressive enlargement of the left atrial (LA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) associated with worsening diastolic function.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The A4CLAX imaging approach provides clinically comparable, comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation in murine models and offers improved sensitivity for detecting subtle changes in cardiac performance during disease progression.",

Evaluation by a low vision clinic for rehabilitation and genetic testing was offered to all infants and they were referred to a pediatrician/endocrinologist.<h4>Results</h4>Eight eyes of 5 infants (3 bilateral and 2 unilateral) presented between 3 months and 4 years of age, with microcornea in 6 of 8 eyes, of which sclerocornea was noted in 5 eyes. B-scan and MRI confirmed ONA and additional features included crumpled or dysplastic retina, total close funnel retinal detachment, or presence of a stalk-like structure (n = 5) or absent lens (n = 2). Three eyes had a view of the posterior segment and showed absent/rudimentary disk, absent retinal vessels, or crumpled retinal tissue with mottled pigmented or tessellated background. Two infants had chiasmal aplasia and 1 infant had a midline lesion in the parieto-occipital region with chiasmal deviation to the right. Balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocation and <i>PITX3</i> mutation was noted in the patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ONA is possibly underdiagnosed due to a focus on other obvious findings, such as microphthalmos/microcornea, poor media clarity obscuring visualization, and lack of imaging to ascertain the optic nerve status. The diagnosis of congenital ONA is significant due to its genetic and systemic implications where the ophthalmologist has the chance to identify it and refer patients for genetic and pediatric assessment, in addition to playing an important role in initiating early visual rehabilitation.",

      "abstractText": "By mapping the mechanical properties of tissue, elastography can improve identification of breast cancer. On the macro-scale, ultrasound elastography and magnetic resonance elastography have emerged as effective clinical methods for the diagnosis of tumors. On the micro-scale, optical coherence elastography (OCE) shows promise for intraoperative tumor margin assessment during breast-conserving surgery. Whilst several OCE studies have demonstrated strong potential, the mechanical models used require the assumption of uniaxial stress throughout the sample. However, breast tissue is heterogeneous and contains compressible features (e.g., ducts and blood vessels) and collagen-rich fibrotic features (e.g., stroma). This heterogeneity can invalidate the assumption of uniaxial stress and reduce the accuracy of OCE, often making it challenging to interpret images. Here, we demonstrate a new variant of OCE based on mapping the Euler angle, i.e., the angle between the principal compression and the loading axis induced by tissue heterogeneity, which removes the assumption of uniaxial deformation. This is enabled by a hybrid three-dimensional (3-D) displacement estimation method that combines phase-sensitive detection and complex cross-correlation, providing access to the 3-D displacement and 3-D strain tensor on the micro-scale. Through experiments on phantoms, we demonstrate that an accuracy of 98.6%, a sensitivity of 0.95\u00b0 (i.e., 16.58 mrad), and a spatial resolution as high as 36 \u03bcm can be achieved in Euler angle imaging. We demonstrate the potential of Euler angle imaging for visualization of breast cancer. Through close correspondence with histology, our results show that mapping the Euler angle provides additional contrast to both optical coherence tomography and a compression OCE technique in identifying cancer. Mapping the Euler angle in breast tissue may provide a new biomarker for intraoperative tumor margin assessment.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Accurate identification of anal fistulas is essential, as it directly impacts the severity of subsequent perianal infections, prognostic indicators, and overall treatment outcomes. Traditional manual recognition methods are inefficient. In response, computer vision methods have been adopted to improve efficiency. Convolutional neural networks(CNNs) are the main basis for detecting anal fistulas in current computer vision techniques. However, these methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, which results in inadequate handling of images of anal fistulas.<h4>Methods</h4>This study proposes a new fusion model, CVT-HNet, that integrates MobileNet with vision transformer technology. This design utilizes CNNs to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies. In addition, the MobileNetV2 with Coordinate Attention mechanism and encoder modules are optimized to improve the precision of detecting anal fistulas.<h4>Results</h4>Comparative experimental results show that CVT-HNet achieves an accuracy of 80.66% with significant robustness. It surpasses both pure Transformer architecture models and other fusion networks. Internal validation results demonstrate the reliability and consistency of CVT-HNet. External validation demonstrates that our model exhibits commendable transportability and generalizability. In visualization analysis, CVT-HNet exhibits a more concentrated focus on the region of interest in images of anal fistulas. Furthermore, the contribution of each CVT-HNet component module is evaluated by ablation experiments.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The experimental results highlight the superior performance and practicality of CVT-HNet in detecting anal fistulas. By combining local and global information, CVT-HNet demonstrates strong performance. The model not only achieves high accuracy and robustness but also exhibits strong generalizability. This makes it suitable for real-world applications where variability in data is common.These findings emphasize its effectiveness in clinical contexts.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Keratoconus (KCN) is a progressive and non-inflammatory corneal disorder characterized by thinning and conical deformation of the cornea, resulting in visual impairment. Early and accurate detection is crucial to prevent disease progression. Conventional diagnostic methods are time-consuming and depend on expert evaluation. This study introduces an advanced deep learning (DL) model aimed at automating KCN detection using corneal topography images.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The proposed model, Optimized MSDALNet, integrates a Multi-Scale Dilated Attention Layer (MSDAL) to capture local and global corneal features at varying spatial resolutions. Training is optimized using Arctic Puffin Optimization (APO), a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by puffin foraging behavior. The model includes Explainable AI (XAI) capabilities using Grad-CAM for visual interpretability. Experiments were conducted using a public KCN dataset with over 1,100 labeled corneal topography images categorized into Normal, Suspect, and KCN classes. Standard pre-processing, data augmentation, and performance evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, FNR, MCC, AUC) were applied.<h4>Results</h4>The Optimized MSDALNet achieved superior classification performance with an accuracy of 99.5%, precision of 99.4%, and specificity of 98.4%. The proposed model outperformed existing methods such as CNN, ViT, and Swin Transformer in terms of accuracy, computational cost (1.2 GFLOPs), and inference speed (8.4 ms/image). Grad-CAM visualization confirmed the model's focus on clinically relevant corneal regions. An ablation study demonstrated the impact of each component in the proposed framework.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Optimized MSDALNet combined with APO delivers an effective and interpretable solution for KCN detection. The model excels in feature extraction, computational efficiency, and clinical transparency. Limitations include dataset size and lack of multimodal inputs. Future work will focus on incorporating diverse datasets and additional patient data to enhance generalizability and diagnostic robustness.",

      "abstractText": "<b>Objective:</b> To explore the clinical efficacy and safety of unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) and percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) techniques in treating recurrent lumbar disc herniation (RLDH). <b>Methods:</b> This study is a retrospective cohort study. The clinical data were retrospectively collected from 68 patients who underwent surgical treatment for RLDH at Department of Mini-invasive Spinal Surgery, the Third People's Hospital of Henan Province from June 2020 to June 2023. The patients were divided into the UBE group (38 cases) and the PTED group (30 cases) based on the surgical technique used. We recorded the drainage volume, surgery duration, and postoperative complications for revision surgeries in both groups. Visual analogue scale(VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were used to assess back pain and leg pain degrees and improvements preoperatively, 3 days postoperatively, 3 months postoperatively, and at the final follow-up. The modified Macnab criteria were used to evaluate outcomes at the final follow-up. The data comparison was conducted using independent sample <i>t</i>-test, repeated measures analysis of variance,or <i>\u03c7</i><sup>2</sup> test. <b>Results:</b> All surgeries were successfully completed. The surgery duration in the UBE group was significantly shorter than in the PTED group, with statistically significant differences ((50.9\u00b110.5)minutes <i>vs.</i>(55.9\u00b112.5)minutes,<i>t</i>=1.234, <i>P</i>=0.001). All patients were followed up for more than 1 year, with a follow-up period of (18.1\u00b15.6) months (range: 12 to 29 months). Both groups showed a significant reduction in VAS and ODI for back and leg pain at all postoperative time points compared to preoperative scores (all <i>P</i><0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in VAS of low back pain, lower limb pain score and ODI score over time between the groups (all <i>P</i>>0.05). At the final follow-up, the UBE group had an excellent and good rate of 92.1% (35/38); the PTED group had an excellent and good rate of 86.6% (26/30). One patient in the UBE group and three in the PTED group experienced cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and one patient in the PTED group experienced postoperative leg numbness; all were discharged after conservative treatment. At the final follow-up, lumbar X-rays, CT, and MRI evaluations showed no recurrence or instability at the surgical segments. <b>Conclusions:</b> Both UBE and PTED can achieve good clinical outcomes in the treatment of RLDH through continuous visualization. The choice of surgical method for RLDH should be more precisely tailored to the individual.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Objectives</h4>We aimed to report the latest and most comprehensive pooled analysis and evidence update, comparing the perioperative outcomes and radiation exposure of endovascular aorto-iliac procedures utilizing imaging fusion (IF) guidance versus conventional imaging techniques.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science up to Oct 2023 for studies that evaluate the effect of IF technology in endovascular treatment on the perioperative outcomes and radiation exposure and published in English. Outcomes measured were procedure time, fluoroscopy time, contrast medium, dose-area product (DAP), radiation doses, length of stay, technical success, the postoperative 30-day mortality, and any major adverse event.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 13 eligible articles involving 1498 patients (732 IF vs 766 Control) were included for the evidence synthesis. Baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were similar in all outcomes except that lower previous aortic disease was observed in the control group. Pooled analysis showed shorter procedure time, fluoroscopy time, contrast medium, DAP, and radiation doses in the IF group. No significant differences were observed in the remaining indicators.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Given the presence of heterogeneity and potential bias, vascular surgeons should select the imaging strategy based on their experience and patient-specific factors.Clinical ImpactThis study provides compelling evidence supporting the integration of imaging fusion (IF) technology into endovascular aorto-iliac procedures. IF significantly reduces procedure time, contrast medium usage, and radiation exposure-key factors for patient safety, particularly in those with renal impairment. By improving anatomical visualization without increasing adverse outcomes, IF offers clinicians a safer, more efficient alternative to conventional imaging. Its impact is most pronounced in the treatment of dilated aortic lesions, where complex vascular anatomy demands precise navigation. These findings may shift clinical practice toward broader adoption of IF guidance in high-risk or anatomically challenging cases, aligning procedural innovation with improved patient care.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Accurate monitoring of tumor progression is crucial for optimizing outcomes in neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis. Standard 2D linear analysis on magnetic resonance imaging is less accurate than 3D volumetric analysis, but since 3D volumetric analysis is time-consuming, it is not widely used. To shorten the time required for 3D volumetric analysis, our lab has been developing an automated artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric tool.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of the study was to survey and interview clinicians treating neurofibromatosis type 2-related schwannomatosis to understand their views on current 2D analysis and to gather insights for the design of an artificial intelligence-driven 3D volumetric analysis tool.<h4>Methods</h4>Interviews examined for the following themes: (1) shortcomings of the currently used linear analysis, (2) utility of 3D visualizations, (3) features of an interactive 3D modeling software, and (4) lack of a gold standard to assess the accuracy of 3D volumetric analysis. A Likert scale questionnaire was used to survey clinicians' levels of agreement with 25 statements related to 2D and 3D tumor analyses.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 14 clinicians completed a survey, and 12 clinicians were interviewed. Specialties ranged across neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology, oncology, and pediatrics. Overall, clinicians expressed concerns with current linear techniques, with clinicians agreeing that linear measurements can be variable with the possibility of two different clinicians calculating 2 different tumor sizes (mean 4.64, SD 0.49) and that volumetric measurements would be more helpful for determining clearer thresholds of tumor growth (mean 4.50, SD 0.52). For statements discussing the capabilities of a 3D volumetric analysis and visualization software, clinicians expressed strong interest in being able to visualize tumors with respect to critical brain structures (mean 4.36, SD 0.74) and in forecasting tumor growth (mean 4.77, SD 0.44).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Clinicians were overall in favor of the adoption of 3D volumetric analysis techniques for measuring vestibular schwannoma tumors but expressed concerns regarding the novelty and inexperience surrounding these techniques. However, clinicians felt that the ability to visualize tumors with reference to critical structures, to overlay structures, to interact with 3D models, and to visualize areas of slow versus rapid growth in 3D would be valuable contributions to clinical practice. Overall, clinicians provided valuable insights for designing a 3D volumetric analysis tool for vestibular schwannoma tumor growth. These findings may also apply to other central nervous system tumors, offering broader utility in tumor growth assessments.",
