Trial data indicate some maintain control with lower doses, especially those with higher serum drug concentrations. This indicates potential for Model-Informed Precision Dosing (MIPD), an advanced therapeutic drug monitoring technique, in guiding dose minimisation. We developed, validated, and user-tested a precision dosing dashboard. We applied a MIPD approach leveraging Bayesian estimation to predict individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for personalised dosing recommendations. A PK model of the exemplar biologic risankizumab, derived from phase I-III psoriasis trial data (13123 observations/1899 patients), was externally validated using real-world UK psoriasis data. The Bayesian model (posterior prediction: mean absolute error 0.89 mg/L; mean percentage error 19.55%; root mean square error 1.24 mg/L; R<sup>2</sup> 0.86) had superior predictive power to the basic PK model (prior prediction). The model was incorporated into an interactive dashboard, enabling input of individual patient data (serum drug concentrations, model covariates). UK healthcare professionals rated the dashboard user-friendly and acceptable. Mean time to generate a dosing interval was 2 minutes. Our dashboard has potential to incorporate other biologics and extend across disease contexts (non-response, other inflammatory diseases) for optimal real-world impact of precision dosing on health and cost outcomes.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The exponential growth in patient data collection by healthcare providers, governments, and private industries is yielding large and diverse datasets that offer new insights into critical medical questions. Leveraging extensive computational resources, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are increasingly utilized to address health-related issues, such as predicting outcomes from Electronic Health Records and detecting patterns in multi-omics data. Despite the proliferation of medical devices based on Artificial Intelligence, data accessibility for research is limited due to privacy concerns. Efforts to de-identify data have met challenges in maintaining effectiveness, particularly with large datasets. As an alternative, synthetic data, that replicate main statistical properties of real patient data, are proposed. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics complicates the selection of appropriate synthetic data generation methods. Effective evaluation of synthetic data must consider resemblance, utility and privacy, tailored to specific applications. Despite available metrics, benchmarking efforts remain limited, necessitating further research in this area.<h4>Results</h4>We present SynthRO (Synthetic data Rank and Order), a user-friendly tool for benchmarking health synthetic tabular data across various contexts. SynthRO offers accessible quality evaluation metrics and automated benchmarking, helping users determine the most suitable synthetic data models for specific use cases by prioritizing metrics and providing consistent quantitative scores. Our dashboard is divided into three main sections: (1) Loading Data section, where users can locally upload real and synthetic datasets; (2) Evaluation section, in which several quality assessments are performed by computing different metrics and measures; (3) Benchmarking section, where users can globally compare synthetic datasets based on quality evaluation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Synthetic data mitigate concerns about privacy and data accessibility, yet lacks standardized evaluation metrics.

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The incidence of infectious mononucleosis (IM) has increased in recent years, particularly in the pediatric population, and there are currently no specific drugs available, posing a threat to the lives and health of children worldwide. Although some results have been published, there is a lack of systematic review and summarization of current research.<h4>Methods</h4>Based on screening criteria, literature on IM in children from 2000 to 2023 was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. The included literature's indicators (country, institution, journal, author, keywords, and references) were analyzed and visualized using Citespace, VOSviewer software, and the Bibliometrix program package.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 538 eligible publications were included in this study. The number of publications has been on an upward trend during this century, with great potential for future growth. The countries with the most publications are the USA and China, and Capital Medical University is the most contributing institution. Hjalgrim, Henrik and Cohen, Jeffrey, I are among the field's most influential authors and co-cited authors. Among the major journals, the JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY had the highest output and the JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES was the most frequently cited. The reference with the highest outbreak intensity was Ramagopalan, SV, LANCET NEUROLOGY, 2010. Through in-depth analysis of the keywords, we conclude that the characteristics of diagnosis and assessment of IM, the association of IM with other diseases, and interventions for IM are the current hot topics of research in the field and that the pathogenesis of IM due to EBV is a cutting-edge topic in the field. This study also analyzes the reasons for geographical research differences and proposes a new \"increasing quantity-improving quality-integrating\" cooperation model.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study's hotspots and frontiers reflect the current status and trends in pediatric IM, and these findings provide important insights to guide future research and optimize therapeutic strategies. In the future, there is a need to strengthen international collaboration and cooperation, conduct RCTs with large sample sizes, and promote the development of new drugs in mechanism research.",

Performing health risk and food safety assessments to derive safety levels of these xenobiotics can protect human health. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a mathematical tool to quantitatively describe chemical disposition in humans and animals informing human food safety and health risk assessments. However, few reviews focus on the application of PBPK models in food animals and discuss their relationship to human food safety and health risk assessments in the last five years (2020-2024). In this series of reviews, we introduce the methodology, recent progress and challenges of PBPK modeling in food animals. The present review is Part I of this series of reviews and it focuses on applications of PBPK models of veterinary drugs in food animals, whereas Part II is a companion review focusing on environmental chemicals. Advanced strategies of PBPK modeling in risk and food safety assessment, including population PBPK, interactive PBPK web dashboard, and generic PBPK are also summarized in Part I. Additionally, we share our perspective on the existing challenges and future direction for PBPK modeling of veterinary medicines in food animals.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Medication nonadherence is a serious problem in cancer, potentially impacts patients' health outcomes and health care costs. Although technology-based medication adherence (MA) interventions have emerged, evidence supporting their quality and effectiveness remains limited.<h4>Objective</h4>This study tested the acceptability, feasibility, and potential effects of Safety and Adherence to Medications and Self-care Advice in Oncology (SAMSON), a digital solution designed to support MA and self-management in cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>A 12-week, 2-arm, unblinded, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted. Adults with hematological malignancies who started oral cancer medicines within the last 12 months were recruited from a metropolitan specialized hospital and randomized 1:1 to SAMSON or control (usual care). The SAMSON solution included a smartphone app with tailored alerts and real-time self-care advice, a web-based dashboard for health care professionals (HCPs) to monitor patients' adherence and symptoms, and motivational interviewing (MI) teleconsultations delivered by oncology nurses and pharmacists at baseline and weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. Primary outcomes were the patients' acceptance of SAMSON, measured by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology at 12 weeks, and study feasibility, measured by predefined rates of recruitment, randomization, retention, intervention adherence, and outcome assessment completion. Secondary outcomes were comparison of MA and clinical self-assessments through online questionnaires, including adherence, toxicity self-management, anxiety and depression symptoms, and quality of life, measured at baseline and 12 weeks between the 2 arms. Data retrieved from the SAMSON app (Swinburne University of Technology) was analysed for task completion.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 33 patients (79% of those who were approached) consented to participate in the trial. Of those, 31/33 (94%) completed baseline surveys and were randomized to SAMSON (15/31) and control arms (16/31). Of 31 patients, 28 (90%) completed the 12-week surveys (12 SAMSON and 16 control). Overall, patients rated the SAMSON solution as highly acceptable (13/15, 87% app usage; 14/15, 93% MI teleconsultation delivery). They reported that SAMSON was easy to use (10/12, 83%) and helpful in improving their MA (6/12, 50%). All study HCPs reported the SAMSON solution was helpful in supporting patients' MA. Patients completed an average of 99 tasks over the 12-week study period (71% of scheduled tasks). Most patients (10/12, 83%) completed all 5 scheduled consultations. All study feasibility measures were higher than the predefined upper thresholds, except the rate of patients' responses to medication reminders.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results demonstrated that the SAMSON solution is acceptable, usable, and useful for oncology HCPs and patients with cancer. The SAMSON solution is feasible in real-life oncology settings. Our next steps involve refining the SAMSON solution based on participants' feedback, conducting a large-scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate its clinical and economic effectiveness, and exploring potential commercialization.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12623000472673; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=385728.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>RR2-10.1136/bmjopen-2023-079122.",

      "abstractText": "To evaluate the efficacy of computed tomography (CT) lymphangiography after direct mesenteric lymph node injection for thoracic duct (TD) visualization in mice. Twelve female BALB/c mice were injected with 35\u2009\u03bcL of iodinated contrast medium (iomeprol 350\u2009mgI/mL) into the mesenteric (mesenteric group) or popliteal (popliteal group) lymph nodes. CT images were acquired before injection and 1\u2009min, 3\u2009min, 5\u2009min, 10\u2009min, and 15\u2009min after injection using a micro-CT scanner. Contrast ratios (CRs) were measured at the cisterna chyli and three levels of the TD (diaphragm, carina, and venous angle). Two experienced radiologists qualitatively assessed images as good, fair, or poor. The mesenteric group had significantly higher mean (\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) CRs than the popliteal group for all examined regions at 1\u2009min after injection: cisterna chyli (14.01\u2009\u00b1\u20094.77 versus 1.47\u2009\u00b1\u20091.21, p\u2009<\u20090.001), diaphragm (7.28\u2009\u00b1\u20092.50 versus 0.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.61, p\u2009=\u20090.0011), carina (10.33\u2009\u00b1\u20093.42 versus 0.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and venous angle (6.26\u2009\u00b1\u20092.02 versus 0.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75, p\u2009<\u20090.001). For the TD between the cisterna chyli and the diaphragm, 6/6 mice in the mesenteric group showed strong enhancement, whereas 5/6 mice in the popliteal group showed minimal or no enhancement. The visual scores of the mesenteric group were significantly higher than those of the popliteal group for all the evaluated regions (p\u2009=\u20090.002). CT lymphangiography via mesenteric lymph node injection provides better imaging of the TD in mice than popliteal lymph node injection. This study enhances TD visualization in mice, advancing preclinical research on lymphatic disorders and improving translational applications for better clinical diagnostics and treatments. Mesenteric lymph node injection improved the efficacy of TD CT lymphangiography in mice. Mesenteric injection provided significantly better TD visualization than popliteal injection. Enhanced TD visualization in mice advances preclinical research on lymphatic diseases.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Hypothyroidism, a prevalent thyroid hormone abnormality identified by biochemical indicators, is prone to serious consequences because of its insidious clinical manifestations and easy underdiagnosis. This research aimed to elucidate the relationships between indicators of lipid and glucose metabolism and hypothyroidism and to assess the value of metabolic indicators for hypothyroidism.<h4>Methods</h4>Prevalence surveys were conducted utilizing information from 3254 NHANES individuals who passed screening between 2007 and 2012. Comparisons of baseline characteristics, assessment of logistic regression and subgroup analyses, visualization of restricted cubic splines curves, and validation of causal mediation analyses were performed to obtain a comprehensive view of the relationships between indicators of lipid and glucose metabolism and hypothyroidism.<h4>Results</h4>Lipid and glucose metabolism indicators, especially the unconventional parameters triglyceride\u2012glucose index (TyG) and remnant cholesterol (RC) and the conventional parameter triglyceride (TG), exhibited robust positive relationships with hypothyroidism and served as crucial mediators in the pathways by which hypothyroidism affects health outcomes. Indicators were varying suggestive for hypothyroidism in distinct populations, with TyG being relatively more valuable.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Indicators of lipid and glucose metabolism (TyG, TG, and RC) were intimately associated with hypothyroidism, with potential applications in the assessment and management of hypothyroidism.",

Here, we present a protocol for the real-time visualization and quantification of pulmonary microvascular dynamics in living mice using contrast echocardiography alongside microbubble injection. We describe steps for mouse preparation, baseline echocardiography, microbubble administration, and imaging to capture dynamic changes in pulmonary vasculature. Closely resembling clinical technique used in humans, this methodology provides an effective tool for investigating the pathophysiology of diverse cardio-pulmonary vascular diseases.

      "abstractText": "The challenge of robust and automated glycopeptide quantitation from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data has yet to be adequately addressed by commercial software. Recently, open-source tools like Skyline and LaCyTools have advanced the field of label-free MS1 level quantitation. Yet, important steps late in the data processing workflow remain manual. Because manual data curation is time-consuming and error-prone, it presents a bottleneck, especially in an era of emerging high-throughput methodologies and increasingly complex analyses such as antigen-specific antibody glycosylation. We addressed this gap by developing GlycoDash, an R Shiny-based interactive web application designed to democratize label-free high-throughput glycoproteomics data analysis. The software comes in at a stage where analytes have been identified and quantified, but whole measurement and individual analyte signals of insufficient quality for quantitation remain and reduce the quality of the overall dataset. GlycoDash focuses on these challenges by incorporating several options for measurement and metadata linking, spectral and analyte curation, normalization, and repeatability assessment, and additionally includes glycosylation trait calculation, data visualization, and reporting capabilities that adhere to FAIR principles. The performance and versatility of GlycoDash were demonstrated across antibody glycoproteomics data of increasing complexity, ranging from relatively simple monoclonal antibody glycosylation analysis to a clinical cohort with over a thousand measurements. In a matter of hours, these large, diverse, and complex datasets were curated and explored. High-quality datasets with integrated metadata ready for final analysis and visualization were obtained. Critical aspects of the curation strategy underlying GlycoDash are discussed. GlycoDash effectively automates and streamlines the curation of glycopeptide quantitation data, addressing a critical need for high-throughput glycoproteomics data analysis. Its robust performance across diverse datasets and its comprehensive feature toolbox significantly enhance both research and clinical applications in glycoproteomics.",

However, single-molecule live-cell imaging of unmodified endogenous RNA has not yet been achieved in a generalizable manner. Here, we present single-molecule live-cell fluorescence in situ hybridization (smLiveFISH), a robust approach that combines the programmable RNA-guided, RNA-targeting CRISPR-Csm complex with multiplexed guide RNAs for direct and efficient visualization of single RNA molecules in a range of cell types, including primary cells. Using smLiveFISH, we track individual native NOTCH2 and MAP1B transcripts in living cells and identify two distinct localization mechanisms including the cotranslational translocation of NOTCH2 mRNA at the endoplasmic reticulum and directional transport of MAP1B mRNA toward the cell periphery. This method has the potential to unlock principles governing the spatiotemporal organization of native transcripts in health and disease.",

This study aims to examine enduring impacts through individual narratives, using Conservation of Resources (COR) theory that serves for studying crises.<h4>Methods</h4>Analysis of narratives from 1148 responses to an open-ended question about pandemic's lasting effects, using qualitative and quantitative methods within COR theory framework including thematic analysis, Elastic Net Regression, word cloud visualization and sociodemographic analysis.<h4>Results</h4>About 42% of respondents reported lasting effects, with almost equal distribution between 'Loss' and 'Gain' groups, and 7% reporting mixed experiences. COR resources manifested as: work-finance and social bonds showed both disruption and strengthening; mental health, physical health and protective habits characterized loss narratives. Gain narratives were predominantly characterized by renewed perspective and personalized time investment. Women reported more physical health impacts. Resource combinations exemplified resource caravans. 'Mixed' group revealed complex balance of loss-gain dynamics. Work-life balance emerged as a sustained valued asset. The findings align with COR theory principles.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Three years post-pandemic onset, while lasting losses persist, narratives indicate shifting dynamics toward gains, predominantly reflecting transformed perspectives. Findings enhance COR theory in pandemic context and inform policy by highlighting emotional toll management and work-life balance preservation.",

Four normally hearing controls and three individuals unilaterally implanted with a HiRes Ultra 3D (Advanced Bionics LLC, California, USA). Participants underwent 3 T MRI using sequences appropriate for the postoperative surveillance of the IAC. Images in normally hearing individuals were acquired after placing a fully functional, unpowered, CI underneath a swimming cap at each of eight candidate scalp positions, four on each side of the head. Images were compared to a control condition without a CI present. and CI users were imaged with similar sequences. In normally hearing controls, the likely impact of the artifact on detection of pathology for multiple neuroradiological locations as rated by two independent radiologists. In CI users, a qualitative assessment of the diagnostic usability of images. Visibility of the ipsilateral IAC and cochlea varied among the three CI users, with images from one participant deemed largely usable, while those from the other two participants exhibited less diagnostic certainty, likely due to differences in implant locations and cranial/neuroanatomical variations. Ratings of images in normally hearing participants showed that more middle-to-anterior CI locations were associated with reduced likelihood of overlooking gross abnormalities. Through meticulous surgical placement, bilateral IAC visualization may be achievable for monitoring chronic health conditions such as tumor surveillance in high-risk patients, and as a safety monitoring outcome measure in clinical trials.",

      "abstractText": "Cervical cancer burden is disproportionately higher in low to middle income countries, especially in countries with a high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) burden. This review investigates barriers to implementation and assesses current progress in cervical cancer screening in lower resource settings by reviewing technologies and strategies that have already been implemented in low to middle income countries. Several novel innovations embrace the recent World Health Organization (WHO) update to screening guidelines that recommends a \"screen and treat\" approach rather than a \"screen, triage and treat\" approach. Innovations include human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling, portable cervical visualization devices, and creative large-scale approaches to increase screening accessibility. Overall, a low-cost, accurate, point-of-care screening test could alleviate most of the barriers associated with cervical cancer screening in lower resource settings. Further research into the development of a low-cost HPV test in conjunction with the HPV vaccine and other screening tools could expedite progress.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence, clinical burden, and health care costs (>US $100 billion) associated with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) will increase significantly as the US population grows and ages over the next 25 years. Existing 2D imaging modalities have inherent limitations in visualizing complex CVD, which may be mitigated with the use of patient-specific 3D advanced visualization (AV) technologies. There remain gaps in knowledge, however, regarding how and with what impact these technologies are being used in CVD.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical attributes and reported utility associated with the use of 3D AV modeling in CVDs, specifically intracerebral arteriovenous malformations.<h4>Methods</h4>This pilot study employs a combination of retrospective analysis and prospective surveys to describe the utilization and utility of patient-specific AV models at a single high-volume certified comprehensive stroke center.<h4>Results</h4>From July 2017 to February 2023, 25 AV models were created for 4 different clinicians. The average patient age was 37.4 years; 44% (11/25) of the patients were African Americans, 52% (13/25) were on public insurance, and 56% (14/25) were associated with a neurovascular procedure. In this study, 18 clinicians with diverse experience responded to AV model surveys, with a 92.2% (166/180) completion rate. There was an average reported utility of 8.0 on a 0-10 scale, with higher scores reflecting increased utility. Compared to 2D viewing, AV models allowed staff to appreciate novel abnormal anatomy, and therefore, they would have changed their therapeutic approach in 45% (23/51) of the cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AV models were used in complex CVDs associated with young, publicly insured individuals requiring resource-intensive interventions. There was strong and diverse clinician engagement with overall report of substantial utility of AV models. Staff clinicians frequently reported novel anatomical and therapeutic insights based on AV models compared to traditional 2D viewing. This study establishes the infrastructure for future larger randomized studies that can be repeated for CVDs or other disease states and incorporate assessments of other AV modalities such as 3D printing and medical extended reality.",

A wide variety of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites can cause infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Histological findings may be nonspecific or overlap with noninfectious inflammatory conditions. To minimize wasted tissue and time, a systematic approach is recommended in which: (1) relevant patient history (eg, comorbidities, travel and other exposures, and immune status) and radiological findings are reviewed, (2) a preliminary differential diagnosis based on this information and on inflammatory patterns and visualization of potential microorganisms on hematoxylin and eosin stains is generated, (3) special stains, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or molecular testing (pathogen-specific or broad-spectrum) are used for confirmation and further classification, and (4) correlation with culture results and other laboratory testing is performed to arrive at a final integrated diagnosis. Discrepancies between molecular and histological findings are often due to contamination and require careful evaluation to avoid treatment of false positives. Consultation with infectious disease pathologists or public health reference laboratories may be needed to confirm diagnoses of unusual organisms or when specialized testing is required.",

      "abstractText": "Linear and volumetric analysis are the typical methods to measure tumor size. 3D volumetric analysis has risen in popularity; however, this is very time and labor intensive limiting its implementation in clinical practice. This study aims to show that an AI-led approach can shorten the length of time required to conduct 3D volumetric analysis of VS tumors and improve image processing accuracy. From Yale New Haven Hospital and public patient recruitment, 143 MRIs were included in the ground truth dataset. To create the tumor models for the ground truth dataset, an image processing software (Simpleware ScanIP, Synopsys) was used. The helper (DPP V1.0) was trained using proprietary AI- and ML-based algorithms and information. A proof-of-concept AI model achieved a mean DICE score of 0.76 (standard deviation 0.21). After the final testing stage, the model improved to a final mean DICE score of 0.88 (range 0.74-0.93, standard deviation 0.04). Our study has demonstrated an efficient, accurate AI for 3D volumetric analysis of vestibular schwannomas. The use of this AI will enable faster 3D volumetric analysis compared to manual segmentation. Additionally, the overlay function would allow visualization of growth patterns. The tool will be a method of assessing tumor growth and allow clinicians to make more informed decisions.",

However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive evaluation and guidance for available reference-based deconvolution methods in cell proportion deconvolution analysis. In this study, we introduce Deconvolution Evaluator (Deconer), a comprehensive toolkit for the evaluation of reference-based deconvolution methods. Deconer provides various simulated and real gene expression datasets, including both bulk and single-cell sequencing data, and offers multiple visualization interfaces. By utilizing Deconer, we conducted systematic comparisons of 16 reference-based deconvolution methods from different perspectives, including method robustness, accuracy in deconvolving rare components, signature gene selection, and building external reference. We also performed an in-depth analysis of the application scenarios and challenges in cell proportion deconvolution methods. Finally, we provided constructive suggestions for users in selecting and developing cell proportion deconvolution algorithms. This work presents novel insights to researchers, assisting them in choosing appropriate toolkits, applying solutions in clinical contexts, and advancing the development of deconvolution tools tailored to gene expression data. The tutorials, manual, source code, and demo data of Deconer are publicly available at https://honchkrow.github.io/Deconer/.",

      "abstractText": "Endometriosis is the presence of hormonally sensitive endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus. It is a common condition, affecting 10% of reproductive-age people assigned as female at birth. Although usually occurring in the pelvis, it can rarely involve the thoracic cavity and diaphragm which is termed thoracic endometriosis. Thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES) refers to four well-recognized clinical entities: catamenial pneumothorax, catamenial hemothorax, catamenial hemoptysis, and lung nodules. However, TES presentation can also be nonspecific, even absent. Optimal management is multidisciplinary, as it depends on patient presentation and lesion characteristics. While initial imaging of thoracic symptoms is with chest radiography and computerized tomography, these modalities have inferior soft tissue contrast resolution and tissue characterization compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially for the detection of both hematic and cystic endometriotic implants. Therefore, a dedicated MRI protocol is essential for diagnosing thoracic endometriosis and aiding surgical planning. Considering the dome-shaped morphology of the diaphragm, sagittal and coronal projections can improve visualization of tiny endometriotic plaques or deposits that are inconspicuous on the axial plane. Breath-hold and respiratory-triggered or navigated techniques are critical for mitigating motion artifacts. T1-weighted fat-suppressed sequences are important for identifying intrinsic T1 hyperintensity and blood products associated with endometriotic lesions. T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences increase sensitivity for cystic or vesicular tissue. Diffusion-weighted and postcontrast imaging can help diagnose alternative causes of symptomology, including malignancy.",

      "abstractText": "The neural basis of emotional experience, both in neurotypical and clinical conditions, remains an open research topic. Historically, the cerebellum was considered a purely motor structure; however, studies since the mid-twentieth century and contributions like the cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome, evidenced its role in emotion. This has led to an expansion of the paradigm, encouraging further research into the cerebellar role in emotion. Understanding this field's development is essential to assessing its current state, identifying knowledge gaps, and exploring emerging areas. This paper analyzes the evolution of scientific production, addressing how scientific interest has changed over time, factors driving growth, dominant topics, leading figures, and collaboration networks. This analysis identifies trends and opportunities, guiding strategies and advancing knowledge through a comprehensive view of the state-of-the-art in this research area. To achieve this, a systematic search was conducted in key databases, identifying 1,162 publications with which an exhaustive quantitative analysis was conducted using bibliometric techniques, network analysis, and visualization tools. The results show exponential growth in the field, evidenced by the increase in publications, researchers, funding sources, and the emergence of new topics. This interest, along with an interdisciplinary approach, has fostered collaboration, with large teams and multicenter projects emerging, although small, isolated teams still predominate. Research mainly focuses on neurological and affective disorders, with a predominance of studies in humans, followed by rodent models. Overall, the analysis reveals a highly interdisciplinary and expanding field. However, challenges remain, including unequal access to resources and limited exploration of some topics.",

Methods: Adenovirus serotypes prevalent in the region (Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China) were analyzed by assessing the results of tNGS analysis of respiratory pathogens in children. On this basis, multiple sets of LAMP primers were designed for the adenovirus hexon gene as the detection target. Optimal primer combinations were further screened, and the composition of the reagent system and amplification procedures were improved to achieve efficient amplification. To realize an instrument-independent, fast-testing strategy, by combining NALF, which is based on the principle of lateral chromatography, small molecule antigens were modified for primers. Moreover, amplification products were bound to the corresponding antibodies on nucleic acid chromatography test strips for visualization. Finally, a series of tests were performed to validate the sensitivity, specificity, and methodological consistency of the LAMP-NALF assay. Results: Adenovirus infections in children in this region during this period were mainly caused by serotype 3. The optimal amplification temperature for optimal primers of LAMP was 65 \u00b0C. The combination of LAMP and NALF could detect femtogram-grade positive plasmid of the hexon gene; besides, there was no cross-reactivity with five other types of common respiratory pathogens in children. The agreement between the LAMP-NALF assay and tNGS/qPCR for detecting the adenovirus in 100 respiratory clinical specimens was 98%. Conclusion: The combination of LAMP and NALF can achieve rapid, convenient and accurate detection of human adenovirus type 3, which can provide a powerful support for the pathogenic diagnosis of adenoviral infections in children, thus contributing to the promotion of the development of point-of-care testing for pathogens.",

      "abstractText": "Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is the first-line investigation test to 'rule out' significant coronary artery disease in low-risk patients. By performing blood flow simulations using computational fluid dynamics, it is possible to derive fractional flow reserve (FFR) from CCTA (FFRCT) images. Coronary computed tomography angiography and FFRCT are now utilized in higher-risk patients to choose the revascularization mode. Furthermore, new applications of CCTA and FFRCT include a planning tool for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which allows the cardiologist to assess lesion-specific ischaemia, plan stent locations and sizes, and use virtual remodelling of the lumen (virtual stenting) to assess the functional impact of PCI. Moreover, CCTA can assist in planning surgical and percutaneous revascularization by determining the disease complexity, vessel size, lesion length, and tissue composition of the atherosclerotic plaque, as well as the best fluoroscopic viewing angle; it may also help in selecting adjunctive percutaneous devices (e.g. rotational atherectomy) and in determining the best landing zone for stents or bypass grafts. Coronary computed tomography angiography has become also the gold standard for pre-procedural annular assessment, device sizing, risk determination of annular injury, coronary occlusion or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, calcification visualization and quantification of the target structure, and prediction of a co-planar fluoroscopic angulation for transcatheter interventions in patients with structural heart disease. Coronary computed tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance could be used also in electrophysiology procedures of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias ablation (imaging during clinical evaluation and pre-procedural evaluation and intra-procedural live integration). The era of interventional imaging has arrived, and it is based on the cooperation of different figures with specific competences (cardio-imagers, electrophysiologists, cardiac surgeons, and invasive cardiologists).",

However, limited studies have been conducted regarding the effect of probiotics on intestinal preparation. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> probiotics in the bowel preparation regimen of children who are candidates for colonoscopy.<h4>Methods and materials</h4>In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, 84 colonoscopy candidate pediatric patients were enrolled. Patients were divided into two equal groups of 42 individuals. One group of patients underwent the bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol regimen 48\u2009h before colonoscopy, as along with a placebo. The other group was administered <i>L. reuteri</i> 10\u2009days before colonoscopy and also received bisacodyl and polyethylene glycol 48\u2009h before the procedure. Then, the bowel preparation of the patients was assessed using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS).<h4>Results</h4>The mean age of patients in the placebo and probiotic groups was 94.1\u2009\u00b1\u200943.8 and 111.2\u2009\u00b1\u200948.8\u2009months, respectively (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.10). The preparation of the left colon was not significantly different between the placebo and probiotic groups (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.075). The effect of <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotic on the preparation of the right colon was excellent in 18 patients (42.86%) and good in 17 patients (40.47%). The preparation of the right colon was significantly different between the placebo and probiotic groups (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.007). Based on the results, there was a significant association between the consumption of <i>L. reuteri</i> and placebo in the preparation of the transverse colon (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.015).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Probiotic pretreatment as part of bowel preparation significantly improves visualization of the colonic mucosa during colonoscopy.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The objective of this study was to compare, in vitro, two dentinal caries lesion detector methods, Caries Finder and BlueCheck, to determine if they were substantially equivalent in their ability to aid visualization of demineralized dentin and to also to compare their performance compared to the traditional visual/tactile method of dentinal caries lesion detection in vitro.<h4>Methods</h4>Sixty-five extracted human teeth containing lesions rated as ICDAS 4,5 or 6 were chosen and then randomly assigned to two groups. Specimens were then evaluated in standard operatory conditions by three evaluators using the traditional visual and tactile method, the Caries Finder method, and the BlueCheck method of detection. The study employed a parallel, randomized controlled study design. To test the equivalence claim, a \"two-one sided test\" (TOST) approach was utilized.<h4>Results</h4>As compared to the traditional method, the Caries Finder method had a 0.9742 accuracy, 95% confidence interval [0.9578, 0.9855], 94.80% sensitivity, 98.53% specificity, 96.47% positive predictive value, 97.82% negative predictive value, 0.938 Kappa value, p\u2009<\u20092.2e-16). The BlueCheck method had a 0.9821 accuracy, 95% confidence interval [0.9682, 0.9910], 96.02% sensitivity, 99.09% specificity, 97.69% positive predictive value, 98.42% negative predictive value, 0.956 Kappa value, p\u2009<\u20092.2e-16). Inter-rater reliability and intra-rater reliability ratings were good to excellent.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of this study support the conclusion that the Caries Finder and BlueCheck methods compare favorably with the traditional method of carious dentin detection. Caries Finder and BlueCheck detection methods were found to have comparable performance in their ability to differentiate carious dentin from healthy tooth structure in vitro; however further in vivo validation is required to confirm clinical equivalence. Both show good to excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability.",

We aim to evaluate if DSC perfusion is a valid and practicable tool at 7T MRI. A successful DSC perfusion was performed in 9 patients with an FDA-approved 7T MRI system (Siemens Terra with 1tx/32rx Nova head coil) in 2023. Half-dose contrast was administered by hand, followed by saline flush. Acquisition was initiated 45 seconds before contrast injection. Voxel size was 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1.6 mm3. Perfusion maps were generated by using either SyngoVia or DynaSuite software. Parameters including relative CBV (rCBV), relative CBF (rCBF), relative MTT (rMTT), and relative TTP (rTTP) were measured in 5 anatomic locations bilaterally (precentral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, corona radiata, thalamus, occipital cortex) and enhancing lesions if present. Normalized ratios of rCBV (nrCBV), rCBF (nrCBF), rMTT (nrMTT), and rTTP (nrTTP) were calculated and compared on boxplots. Two neuroradiologists reviewed each scan visually by using a 5-point Likert scale regarding imaging quality and artifacts. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were made on DSC perfusion in cases with enhanced target lesions. Uploading the source images to imaging software took approximately 30\u2009minutes to a few hours. In a few circumstances, large data caused software crashes. Map generation took approximately 10-15\u2009minutes. Susceptibility artifacts varied from mild to moderate in cerebellum, temporal lobes, brainstem, and basal ganglia and none to minimal in the frontal, occipital, and parietal gyri. Map quality was excellent to reasonably good for all cases. The nrCBV, nrCBF, nrMTT, and nrTTP resulted in similar measurements for each anatomic area. Six target lesions were assessed in 2 different patients with well to excellent visualization on fused maps. Three lesions were characterized as tumor progression (1 biopsy-confirmed, 2 unconfirmed), 1 lesion as indeterminant (regressed in follow-up), and 2 lesions as radiation necrosis (1 stable, 1 regressed on follow-up). Despite limitations with postprocessing issues, it is possible to reliably measure nrCBV, nrCBF, nrMTT, and nrTTP values with DSC perfusion by using a clinical 7T MRI system, and qualitatively, excellent or reasonably good fusion maps can be generated with high resolution.",

      "abstractText": "Demonstrating mortality reduction in new colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs through randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is challenging. We systematically reviewed single-round program performance outcomes using a stepwise approach proposed by the World Endoscopy Organization CRC Screening Committee framework. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Central, and Ichushi Web databases were searched until October 28, 2024, to find RCTs comparing guaiac-based and immunochemical fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT and FIT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), computed tomographic colonography (CTC), and total colonoscopy (TCS). Paired reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed bias risk. A Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis was conducted, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The primary outcome was advanced neoplasia (AN) detection, and the secondary outcomes were participation and colorectal cancer (CRC) detection, all during the first screening round. Eighteen RCTs (437,072 invitees) were included. The risk of bias was low or raised some concerns for screening participation, but it was high for detection outcomes. In the network meta-analysis of 15 RCTs not allowing crossover, the FIT-based program had a higher AN detection rate than the gFOBT-based program (relative risk [RR] 2.48; 95% credible interval [CrI] 1.52-4.21; moderate certainty). AN detection rates were not different in the CTC- (RR 1.01; CrI 0.43-2.23; very low certainty) and TCS-based (RR 1.03; CrI 0.54-1.78; low certainty) programs compared with the FS-based program. All the visualization modality programs had higher AN detection rates than the FIT-based program (FS: RR 2.13 [CrI 1.38-3.77]; CTC 2.16 [1.11-4.51]; and TCS 2.19 [1.43-3.48]; all with low certainty). Low event rates precluded definitive conclusions regarding CRC detection (very low to low certainty). The TCS-based program had the worst participation rate (very low to low certainty). Comparative data allowing crossover were limited. This is the first network meta-analysis that evaluates program-level initial performance indicators. FIT-based programs likely detect more AN cases than gFOBT-based programs, while FS-, CTC-, and TCS-based programs may outperform FIT. Due to limitations in first-round results, long-term outcomes should be assessed after 10-15 years.",

      "abstractText": "The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, the resulting reinfections, and post-COVID-19 condition continue to impact many people's lives. Tracking websites like the one at Johns Hopkins University no longer report the daily confirmed cases, posing challenges to accurately determine the true extent of infections. Many COVID-19 cases with mild symptoms are self-assessed at home and reported on social media, which provides an opportunity to monitor and understand the progression and evolving trends of the disease. We aim to build a publicly available database of COVID-19-related tweets and extracted information about symptoms and recovery cycles from self-reported tweets. We have presented the results of our analysis of infection, reinfection, recovery, and long-term effects of COVID-19 on a visualization website that refreshes data on a weekly basis. We used Twitter (subsequently rebranded as X) to collect COVID-19-related data, from which 9 native English-speaking annotators annotated a training dataset of COVID-19-positive self-reporters. We then used large language models to identify positive self-reporters from other unannotated tweets. We used the Hibert transform to calculate the lead of the prediction curve ahead of the reported curve. Finally, we presented our findings on symptoms, recovery, reinfections, and long-term effects of COVID-19 on the Covlab website. We collected 7.3 million tweets related to COVID-19 between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2024, including 262,278 self-reported cases. The predicted number of infection cases by our model is 7.63 days ahead of the official report. In addition to common symptoms, we identified some symptoms that were not included in the list from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as lethargy and hallucinations. Repeat infections were commonly occurring, with rates of second and third infections at 7.49% (19,644/262,278) and 1.37% (3593/262,278), respectively, whereas 0.45% (1180/262,278) also reported that they had been infected >5 times. We identified 723 individuals who shared detailed recovery experiences through tweets, indicating a substantially reduction in recovery time over the years. Specifically, the average recovery period decreased from around 30 days in 2020 to approximately 12 days in 2023. In addition, geographic information collected from confirmed individuals indicates that the temporal patterns of confirmed cases in states such as California and Texas closely mirror the overall trajectory observed across the United States. Although with some biases and limitations, self-reported tweet data serves as a valuable complement to clinical data, especially in the postpandemic era dominated by mild cases. Our web-based analytic platform can play a significant role in continuously tracking COVID-19, finding new uncommon symptoms, detecting and monitoring the manifestation of long-term effects, and providing necessary insights to the public and decision-makers.",

      "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Dual-energy computed tomography enterography (DECTE) has significantly improved gastrointestinal imaging quality. Double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) has enabled comprehensive visualization of the small intestinal mucosa. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of small-intestine DECTE and DBE for small bowel Crohn's disease (CD).<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study was conducted between 1 July 2016 and 1 November 2023 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. The study included 72 CD patients who underwent both DECTE and DBE, with 4 patients repeating both procedures within 3\u00a0months.<h4>Results</h4>The diagnostic rate of small bowel CD using DBE was 80.3%, which was higher than that using DECTE (65.8%, P\u2009=\u20090.044). The combined small bowel CD diagnostic rate was 89.5%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The detection rate of stenosis using DBE was 46.1%, which was higher than that using DECTE (13.2%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). The combined detection rate of stenosis was 52.6%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (P\u2009<\u20090.001). For ulcers, DBE had a higher detection rate (73.7%) than DECTE (7.9%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). The combined ulcer detection rate was 76.3%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The detection rate of long ulcers (\u2265\u20092\u00a0cm) and non-ileocecal ulcers by DBE were both 17.9%. For patients with abdominal pain, DBE had a diagnostic rate of 79.4%, higher than 63.5% of DECTE (\u03c72\u2009=\u20093.889, P\u2009=\u20090.049). The combined diagnostic rate was 87.3%, which was higher than that of DECTE alone (\u03c72\u2009=\u20099.626, P\u2009=\u20090.002). For patients with diarrhoea, the DBE's diagnostic rates were 86.8% and 68.4% for DECTE (P\u2009=\u20090.097). The combined diagnostic rate was 94.7%, higher than DECTE alone (\u03c72\u2009=\u20097.092, P\u2009=\u20090.008). For patients with other symptoms, such as abdominal distension or vomiting, the DBE diagnostic rate was 79.4% compared with 61.8% for DECTE (P\u2009=\u20090.183). The combined diagnostic rate was higher than DECTE alone (\u03c72\u2009=\u20096.620, P\u2009=\u20090.010). Furthermore, notable differences in C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, faecal calprotectin, haemoglobin, platelet count, albumin, haematocrit, Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease scores were observed between ulcer-positive and ulcer-negative patients detected by DBE (P\u2009<\u20090.05), whereas DECTE did not show significant differences (P\u2009>\u20090.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>DBE or the combined use of DECTE and DBE provides superior diagnostic performance for small bowel CD, particularly in detecting stenosis and ulcers, compared with DECTE alone. DBE can be used to identify long ulcers and non-ileocecal ulcers. Moreover, DBE helps diagnose small bowel CD across different clinical manifestations and assess disease activity in various inflammatory states.",
